the city are euthanized because they are unwanted, and data shows that the
number of dogs and cats that must be euthanized is on the increase.
Furthermore, the overpopulation of stray dogs and cats disturbs the quiet
enjoyment of property within the city, affecting the quality of life in
residential neighborhoods. The city council finds that the overpopulation and
attendant high costs of disposal and enforcement can be significantly reduced
through a spay and neutering program. It is therefore the policy of the city of
Duncan to encourage and promote through appropriate fee schedules and
legislation the spaying and neutering of dogs and cats as a means of
responsible pet ownership. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003)
4-402: IMPOUNDMENT FEES; FIRST OFFENSE:
First offense impoundment fees for allowing intact animals to run at large will
be twice as much as the impoundment fees for allowing sterilized animals to run
at large. The impoundment fee for allowing an intact animal to run at large
will be reduced by one-half (1/2) upon presentation of a written receipt from a
veterinarian for prepayment of having the animal sterilized. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-
2003)
4-403: IMPOUNDMENT FEES; SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT OFFENSES:
Second or subsequent impoundment fees for allowing intact animals to run at
large will be twice as much as the first offense impoundment fee for allowing
intact animals to run at large. If the animal is not redeemed within seventy
two (72) hours, exclusive of holidays and weekends, the animal shall become the
property of the city and disposed of as described in section
4-208 of this part. The impoundment fee for second or subsequent offenses will
be reduced by one-half (1/2) upon presentation of a written receipt from a
veterinarian for prepayment of having the animal sterilized. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-
2003)
ARTICLE B.  GENERAL RESTRICTIONS
4-410: KEEPING OF DOGS AND CATS RESTRICTED BY NUMBER:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation that owns,
leases or controls any premises within the city to maintain on said premises
more than a combined total of four (4) dogs and/or cats over the age of six (6)
months. This provision shall not apply to agriculturally zoned properties. Any
owner having more than the above prescribed number of dogs or cats prior to May
1, 2000, and who can verify their ownership by way of rabies certificates may
continue with the same animals without penalty.
   B.   It shall be unlawful to maintain any number of animals within a
dwelling unit in such a way that the conditions of the dwelling unit constitute
a nuisance or health hazard and threat to the occupants or welfare of the
animals maintained. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit any
person to maintain any dangerous animal, whether inside or outside a dwelling
unit. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
4-411: CONFINEMENT OF FEMALE DOGS AND CATS IN HEAT:
   A.   The owner of any female dog or female cat in heat shall keep said
animal confined in a building or secure enclosure, or in a veterinary hospital
or boarding kennel, in such a manner that the female dog or cat cannot come
into contact with another dog or cat except for planned breeding purposes, in
which event such dogs or cats shall be confined in some enclosed place entirely
out of the public view.
   B.   Any person who violates this provision, either wilfully or through
failure to exercise due care and control, is subject to the penalties
prescribed in section
1-108 of this code. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
ARTICLE C.  REGISTRATION; TAGS
4-415: REGISTRATION/CITY TAGS NOT REQUIRED:
   A.   Pet registration or obtaining city tags is not required for dogs, cats
or ferrets. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003)
   B.   Pet owners are encouraged to have a subcutaneous computer chip
implanted in their animals to ensure the most accurate and expedient way of
identifying the owner. However, since every animal more than four (4) months of
age is required to have a current, valid rabies vaccination tag, such rabies
vaccination tag is deemed sufficient to identify owners. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003;
amd. 2015 Code)
ARTICLE D.  RABIES CONTROL
4-420: VACCINATION REQUIRED:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to own, keep, or harbor within the limits
of the city any dog, cat, or ferret, male or female, over the age of four (4)
months unless such animal has a current vaccination against rabies administered
by a licensed veterinarian. Said immunization is considered valid if given
within the last twelve (12) months, however, the city and state regulations
recognize a three (3) year rabies vaccine when given upon the second or later
boosters. The expiration date on the rabies certificate is to be used as prima
facie evidence to establish status of the immunization. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003)
4-421: RABIES CERTIFICATE AND TAG; RECORDS REQUIRED:
   A.   The vaccination required in section
4-420 of this chapter shall be performed by a veterinarian. Upon payment of the
veterinarian's fee, the veterinarian shall deliver to the owner, keeper, or
harborer of each vaccinated dog, cat, or ferret a certificate showing the date
of vaccination, its apparent age, and a statement as to whether the dog or cat
is spayed or neutered. At the time of delivery of the certificate, the
veterinarian shall also deliver to the owner, keeper, or harborer of the
vaccinated dog or cat a metal or plastic tag to be known as a "vaccination
tag", which shall be attached to the collar of the dog or cat, except when
wearing a tag is exempted for medical reason by a veterinarian. The certificate
and tag shall be prima facie evidence that the dog, cat, or ferret has been
vaccinated. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000; amd. Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003)
   B.   Veterinarians shall be required to keep a record of a rabies
vaccination for a minimum period of three (3) years. This record must include:
name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the animal; date of
vaccination; animal identification; brand name of vaccine used, vaccine
expiration date, and producer of vaccine.
   C.   Three (3) year immunity conferred by the second or subsequent boosters
with a three (3) year rabies vaccine will be recognized. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
4-422: RABIES CONTROL:
   A.   Every dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person shall be promptly
reported to the animal control officer and shall be securely confined at the
animal shelter or its authorized agent unless the owner makes arrangements with
a veterinary hospital of the owner's choice at the owner's expense. Confinement
shall be under the supervision of a veterinarian for a period of ten (10) days
from the date the person was bitten or as otherwise provided in this section.
The impoundment and observation of the dog, cat, or ferret shall be conducted
at the veterinarian's facility, or the animal shelter or its authorized agent.
Once confined, the dog, cat, or ferret shall not be released from such
confinement except by written permission of the animal control officer. In the
case of stray dogs or cats or in the cases of dogs, cats, or ferrets whose
ownership is not known, such quarantine shall be at the animal shelter or its
authorized agent. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003)
   B.   The animal control officer may make an exception to the requirement of
confinement with a veterinarian under the following circumstances:
      1.   Dogs, cats, or ferrets involved in a first party ownership may be
allowed to be securely confined and closely observed at the owner's home for a
period of ten (10) days immediately following the bite as further defined in
subsection
4-423B of this chapter; and
      2.   Dogs in service to the blind, police dogs or search and rescue dogs
in the line of duty, or other currently vaccinated dogs or cats in a situation
where separation from the owner will threaten the owner's well being, may be
allowed to be placed in a home quarantine.
When an exception is granted, the animal control officer will provide
information regarding the symptoms of rabies to the person responsible for
containing the animal during the quarantine period. If the animal should
display any of the symptoms for rabies, the responsible person must immediately
contact the animal control officer for further disposition.
   C.   The owner upon demand made by the animal control officer shall
forthwith surrender the dog, cat, or ferret that has bitten a human for
supervised quarantine, which expense shall be borne by the owner, and may be
reclaimed by the owner if adjudged free of rabies upon payment of the fees set
forth in this part and upon compliance with applicable spaying or neutering
provisions set forth in article A of this chapter.
   D.   Any domestic animal which is currently vaccinated against rabies and is
exposed to a rabid animal shall be revaccinated within seventy two (72) hours
of notification and isolated, by leashing or confinement under the owner's
supervision, for a period of at least forty five (45) days.
   E.   Any livestock or equine animal which is not currently vaccinated and is
exposed to a rabid animal shall be managed according to the most current
compendium of animal rabies control published by the National Association Of
State Public Health Veterinarians and any state department of agriculture
guidelines, that may apply. Any dog, cat, or ferret which is not currently
vaccinated against rabies and is exposed to a rabid animal shall be:
      1.   Euthanized immediately either by a veterinarian of the owner's
choice, or the animal control officer or his agent; or
      2.   Placed in strict quarantine and observed for a period of six (6)
months under the supervision of a veterinarian at a veterinary hospital. Such
dog, cat, or ferret shall be vaccinated against rabies approximately thirty
(30) days prior to release from quarantine.
   F.   When a dog, cat, or ferret under quarantine has been diagnosed as being
rabid, or suspected by a veterinarian as being rabid, and dies while under such
observation, then the animal control officer shall immediately send the head of
the animal to veterinary pathology laboratory of Oklahoma State University or
other recognized diagnostic laboratory for rabies examination. He shall notify
the public health officer of reports of human contact and the diagnosis made of
the suspected animal. If the animal is decapitated, such work shall be done by
a veterinarian.
   G.   When one or both reports give a positive diagnosis of rabies, the city
manager may recommend a citywide quarantine for a period of thirty (30) days.
Upon the invoking of such quarantine, no dog or cat shall be taken into the
streets, or permitted to be in the streets, during such period of quarantine.
   H.   If there are additional positive cases of rabies occurring during the
period of quarantine, such period of quarantine may be extended for an
additional period.
   I.   No person shall kill, or cause to be killed, any rabid dog, cat, or
ferret, any dog, cat, or ferret suspected of having been exposed to rabies, or
any dog, cat, or ferret biting a human, except as provided in this section, nor
remove the same from the city without permission from the animal control
officer.
   J.   The carcass of any dead dog, cat, or ferret exposed to rabies shall
upon demand be surrendered to the animal control officer.
   K.   No person shall fail or refuse to surrender any dog, cat, or ferret for
quarantine or destruction as required in this section when demand is made
therefor by the animal control officer.
   L.   Payment of any fees incurred and the cost of boarding the dog, cat, or
ferret shall be the responsibility of the person owning, keeping or harboring
the animal. Further, the payment of fees incurred in the cost of euthanasia and
the sending of an animal for rabies testing shall be the responsibility of the
person owning, keeping or harboring the animal. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
4-423: ANIMAL BITES; RABIES EXAMINATION; QUARANTINE:
   A.   If the identity and address of the owner of any animal that bites a
person is known, it shall be promptly furnished to the animal control officer
and the county health department. The animal, regardless of its immunization
status, shall be securely quarantined at the animal shelter unless the owner
makes arrangements with a veterinary hospital of the owner's choice at the
owner's expense. The animal shall be observed by a licensed veterinarian for a
period of ten (10) days, and may not be released until such reasonable
determination has been made that the animal is not infected with rabies, unless
the bite was a severe bite by an unimmunized animal. In circumstances of a
severe bite (bite on the head, face, neck or upper extremities; or deep
laceration; or multiple bite wounds) by an unimmunized animal, the biting
animal should be humanely killed immediately, without damaging the head, and
the head removed and shipped, under refrigeration, for examination at the
Oklahoma state department of health. If the animal is not immediately available
for testing, the individuals exposed should consult with their physician
concerning the need for immediate initiation for rabies prophylaxis. In case of
animals whose ownership is unknown, such quarantine shall be at the city animal
shelter or its authorized agent. If an owner becomes known, the animal may be
reclaimed by the owner if adjudged free of rabies, and such owner shall then
pay any related charges for confinement. Signs of rabies in wild animals cannot
be interpreted reliably; therefore, any wild animal that has exposed a person
should be killed at once (without unnecessary damage to the head) and the head
submitted for examination for evidence of rabies. (Ord. 1563, 3-25-2003)
   B.   An animal that bites or scratches the animal's owner or a family member
in a first party ownership will be allowed to be securely confined and observed
at the owner's home for a ten (10) day period immediately following the bite
and shall not be otherwise quarantined if the owner so requests. This exception
will only be allowed when it is determined by the kennel master or his designee
that the conditions for secure confinement and animal supervision can be met by
the responsible first party. In addition, the owner must provide proof of
current rabies immunization, which has been provided by a licensed doctor of
veterinary medicine. It shall be the animal control officer's duty to inform
the person about the benefits and risks of quarantine. If the owner or family
member does not request a quarantine of the animal, they will be required to
execute a release of liability to the city of Duncan, Oklahoma, in a manner
prescribed by the city. If the owner or family member is under eighteen (18)
years of age, then the release shall also be executed by that person's parent
or guardian.
   C.   Dogs in service to the blind, police dogs or search and rescue dogs in
the line of duty, or other currently vaccinated dogs or cats in a situation
where separation from the owner will threaten the owner's well being, may not
be required to be placed in quarantine at the discretion of the kennel master
or his designee.
   D.   Stray or unwanted dogs or cats that have bitten any person may either
be quarantined for ten (10) days at an approved veterinary facility or an
animal control facility; or immediately euthanized and the brain tissue
submitted to the state department of health laboratory for rabies testing at
the discretion of the kennel master or his designee.
   E.   It is the duty of every physician, veterinarian or other practitioner
to report to the animal control officer the names and addresses of persons
treated for bites inflicted by animals, together with such other information as
will be helpful in rabies control.
   F.   It is the duty of every licensed veterinarian to report to the animal
control officer his diagnoses of any animal observed by him to be a rabid
suspect.
   G.   The kennel master shall keep or cause to be kept an accurate and
detailed record of all bite cases reported to the city with a complete report
of the investigation of each case. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000; amd. 2015 Code)
4-424: SECURING SUPPORT INFORMATION ON DIAGNOSED ANIMALS:
When an animal under quarantine has been diagnosed as being rabid or is
suspected of having rabies by a licensed veterinarian and dies while under such
observation, the animal control officer, veterinarian, the city health officer,
or other designated emissary shall immediately send the necessary part of such
animal to the state health department for pathological examination and shall
notify the proper public health officer of any reports of human contact. (Ord.
1510, 8-8-2000)
4-425: DOGS AND CATS CONFINED; WHEN:
   A.   When the health officer or chief of police determines and certifies
that a dog, a cat, or other animal in the city or within five (5) miles of the
city is or was infected with rabies and that an epidemic of rabies threatens
the city, the council, by resolution, may order all dogs, cats and other
animals to be confined during a period of time to be determined by the council.
Such resolution or an adequate notice of its passage shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the city and shall go into effect on
the day following such publication unless the resolution prescribes a later
time.
   B.   While such resolution is in effect, it is unlawful for any owner to
permit a dog or cat to be at large in violation of such resolution, or for any
dog or cat to be at large in violation thereof. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
4-426: RABIES CRISIS DECLARATION:
When a report gives a suspected or a positive diagnosis of rabies, or when the
city, county or state health officials feel that a rabies crisis may be
imminent, the health officials may recommend to the city manager citywide
quarantine, and upon the invoking of such quarantine by the city council, by
resolution, no animal shall be taken into the streets or permitted to be in the
streets, except for short periods of exercise under leash and control of a
competent adult. During the quarantine no animal may be taken or removed from
the city without written permission of the animal control officer. This
declaration must be made by notice in a general circulated newspaper of the
community and will last as long as health officials determine the situation
requires such action. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
4-427: DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS UNDER CRISIS PERIOD:
   A.   During the period of rabies quarantine as mentioned, every animal
bitten by an animal adjudged to be rabid shall be forthwith destroyed, or at
the owner's expense and option, shall be treated for a rabies infection by a
licensed veterinarian, or held under six (6) month quarantine by the owner in
the same manner as a female in season. The period of quarantine may be extended
from time to time.
   B.   In the event there are additional positive cases of rabies occurring
during the period of the quarantine, such period of quarantine may be extended
for an additional six (6) months.
   C.   No person shall kill or cause to be killed any rabid animal, any animal
suspected of having been exposed to rabies, or any animal biting or scratching
a human, except as herein provided, nor to remove same from the city limits

exposed to rabies, or any animal which has bitten a human, except as herein
provided. The carcass of any dead animal exposed to rabies shall be surrendered
to the animal control officer upon demand, and the animal control officer shall
direct disposition of the animal. No person shall refuse to surrender any
animal for quarantine or destruction when such demand is lawfully made by the
animal control officer. It is the duty of every physician, veterinarian or
other practitioner to report to the animal control division the names and
addresses of persons treated for bites inflicted by animals, together with such
other information as will be helpful in rabies control. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
4-429: KILLING OR REMOVING RABID ANIMAL PROHIBITED:
   A.   No person, other than a law enforcement officer or animal control
officer, shall kill or cause to be killed any rabid animal, any animal
suspected of having been exposed to rabies, or any animal biting a human,

officer. Such refusal shall be deemed an offense. (Ord. 1510, 8-8-2000)
ARTICLE E.  VICIOUS DOGS
4-435: CONFINEMENT:
The owner of any vicious dog shall confine the animal within a building or
secure enclosure, and display a sign on the premises that there is a dangerous
dog on the premises. The owner shall not take the dog out of the building or
secure enclosure unless the dog is securely muzzled and restrained by a chain
or leash not exceeding six feet (6') in length and under the actual physical
control of a responsible, competent person. The muzzle must be made in a manner
that it will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or
respiration but will prevent it from biting any person or animal. (Ord. 1510,
8-8-2000)
4-436: REDEMPTION PROHIBITED; HEARING; COURT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VICIOUS
ANIMALS:
   A.   The owner of any vicious animal impounded for being vicious and found
running at large may not redeem the animal from the animal shelter or its
authorized agent unless the municipal court or another court of competent
jurisdiction, upon hearing, authorizes such redemption. The animal control
officer shall stay the destruction of the vicious animal pending said hearing
if the owner agrees in writing to pay boarding fees as determined by the animal
shelter or its authorized agent for the duration of the impoundment. A vicious
animal will not be put up for adoption.
   B.   Any dog or other animal alleged to be vicious or dangerous may be
proceeded against in the municipal court, after a complaint has been duly filed

         a.   The person or animal so attacked was not at the time trespassing
upon the property of the owner or person having control of such dog or animal;
or

animal so attacked was provoking or teasing such dog or other animal; or
      2.   The dog or other animal is of such vicious and fierce disposition as
to attack human beings or animals without provocation, then the court shall
have the authority to order such dog or other animal kept muzzled or that such
dog or other animal be kept within a sufficient enclosure. If such dog or other
animal has bitten or attacked a human being or animal, the court may order that
it be delivered to an animal control officer and destroyed by him.
      3.   Any person who wilfully violates the order of the court under these
provisions may be punished for contempt of court. The court shall also have the
authority to have the dog or other animal destroyed if such person refuses to
comply with the court's order. In addition, the court may also impose fines and

control officer shall be permitted to inspect, at all reasonable times, all
animals and kennels.
   B.   Refusal by the owner or operator of the kennel to permit such

8-308: SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES:
   A.   Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and
immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be
such as to justify, and even to require the city manager or other appropriate
officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action
summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until
more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
   B.   The chief of the fire department, the chief of police, the city
attorney, the building inspector, the electrical official, the plumbing
official, or any other officer subordinate to the city manager may submit
through or with the consent of the city manager to the city council, a
statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the
city or law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The city
manager himself, the health officer, any council member, or any resident or
residents of the city may submit such a statement and request a recommendation
to the city council.
   C.   The council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a
nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the
council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and
other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the
council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner
of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible
for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if
such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the
owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by
service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the
names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be
published in a paper of general circulation within the city.
   D.   If the council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall
direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to
abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or
welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be
unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety,
morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate
it within the specified time, the council shall direct the city manager to
abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as
authorized by 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 16. The city clerk shall send a
statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons
responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the
circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost
shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as other debts of the city may
be collected. (Prior code § 13-2)
8-309: ABATEMENT BY SUIT IN DISTRICT COURT:
In cases where it is deemed impractical summarily to abate a nuisance, the city
may bring suit in the district court of the county where the nuisance is
located, as provided in 50 Oklahoma Statutes section 17. (Prior code § 13-3)
8-310: NUISANCE UNLAWFUL:
It is unlawful for any person, including, but not limited to, any owner,

permit a nuisance to remain on premises under his control within the city.

8-311: HEALTH NUISANCES; ABATEMENT:
   A.   Pursuant to authority granted by 63 Oklahoma Statutes section
1-1011, the health officer shall have authority to order the owner or occupant
of any private premises in the city to remove from such premises, at his own
expense, any source of filth, cause of sickness, condition conducive to the
breeding of insects or rodents that might contribute to the transmission of
disease, or any other condition adversely affecting the public health, within
twenty four (24) hours, or within such other time as may be reasonable, and a
failure to do so shall constitute an offense. Such order shall be in writing
and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or
authorized agent thereof, by the health officer or by a police officer, or a
copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of the owner,
occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the premises is
unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown, or is
without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the
premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper having a
general circulation in the city.
   B.   If the order is not complied with, the health officer may cause the
order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified
to the city clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be
added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if
he is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility service.
The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added,
and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same regulations
relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner
or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after
certification to the city clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any
other debt due the city may be collected. (Prior code § 13-15)

12-260: AREA REGULATIONS:
   A.   The front, side and rear yard regulations for residential uses shall be
the same as the requirements of the R-3 general residential district; (Prior
code § 16-18)
   B.   Whenever property in this district abuts or is separated only by a
street or alley from property within a residential or agricultural district,
issuance of building permits thereon may be subject to approval of a
development plan by the planning commission as follows:
      1.   The conditions of such approval may impose such front, side and rear
yard setbacks, screening, landscaping, driveway and parking area design
requirements as shall be deemed necessary to protect the character of the
adjacent properties; provided, that in no instance shall a setback of greater
than twenty five feet (25') from any property line be required;
      2.   Conditions imposed by the planning commission shall be set forth in
the minutes of the commission and shall have the same force and effect as if
set forth in these regulations; (Ord. 1486, 6-22-1999)

street parking requirements set forth in section
12-364 of this chapter. (Prior code § 16-18)
   F.   The city council finds that while storage warehouses conform to the
general intent of this district, they are not the highest and best use of the
prime commercial frontage property of the district. Further, the location of
such warehouses directly on certain street frontages detracts from the
appearance and character of the community. It is, therefore, the policy of the
city that storage warehouses in this district shall comply with the following
conditions:
      1.   Notwithstanding the zoning of the abutting property, the property
owner or developer shall submit a development plan subject to the approval of,
and the conditions established by, the planning commission in the manner as
provided in subsection B of this section.
      2.   Except as may be required for ingress and egress, or as provided in
subsection F3 of this section, storage warehouses shall not be located on any
lot, parcel or tract of land which has any portion of its boundaries situated
within three hundred feet (300') of the right of way of a designated arterial
in the major street plan with an aggregate traffic count exceeding ten thousand
(10,000) vehicles per day. For purposes of verifying a traffic count, the
community development director may take notice of data available to his office
or may require the owner/developer to obtain a traffic count at his expense.
      3.   Where storage warehouses are proposed as part of a planned unit
development pursuant to sections 12-340 through 12-342 of this chapter, such
warehouses may be located on a lot, parcel or tract which is closer to the
designated arterial than specified in subsection F2 of this section; provided,
that in all cases, said warehouses and accessory buildings shall be set back
from the right-of-way a minimum of three hundred twenty five feet (325'). (Ord.
1511, 8-22-2000)
12-261: HEIGHT REGULATIONS:
No building shall exceed two and one-half (21/2) stories or thirty five feet
(35') in height, except as hereinafter provided in section
12-362 of this chapter. (Prior Code § 16-18)

ARTICLE H.  PLANNED UNIT ZONING AND
MULTIPLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS
12-340: PURPOSE OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   It is the intent of planned unit development zoning (PUD) to encourage
unified design of housing, commercial, industrial, or institutional areas and
facilities, or combinations thereof, to provide for integrated developments
having harmony of design and variety of function. It is not intended to permit
a greater density or uses different from those set forth in the regulations of
the district in which the development is located, but this section is to
provide for a greater flexibility in the design of buildings, yards, courts,
and circulation, than would otherwise be possible through the strict
application of district regulations, and to produce:
      1.   A maximum choice in the types of environment and living units
available to the public;
      2.   Open space and recreation areas;
      3.   A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography, and geologic features, and prevents soil erosion;
      4.   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development;
      5.   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets and thereby lower housing costs;
      6.   An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development; and
      7.   A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other sections of this chapter.
   B.   The planned unit development section is designed to provide for small
and large scale developments incorporating a single type or a variety of
residential and related uses which are planned and developed as a unit. Such
development may consist of individual lots or it may have common building
sites. A planned unit shall be a separate entity with a distinct character in
harmony with surrounding development. (Prior code § 16-29)
12-341: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORIZED:
   A.   A planned unit development may be authorized under the provisions and
procedures below:
      1.   Zoning District: A planned unit development shall be permitted in
any zoning district except the A-1 general agricultural, A-2 suburban or R-
4 residential estate districts;
      2.   Uses Permitted: The uses permitted within a planned unit development
shall be restricted to those allowed within the zoning district or districts
within which it is located. However, the planning commission may recommend and
the city council may, by ordinance approving the planned unit development,
establish more restrictive use requirements or limitations for all or portions
of a planned unit development, as may be necessary to protect and maintain the
character of the developments;
      3.   Design Characteristics: The design of a planned unit development
shall provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the
spirit and purpose of the district or districts in which it is located. It may
provide for the modification of yard, setback, and height requirements and
individual lot or building site coverage requirements, but the use, density,
intensity of use, and overall coverage requirements for the district or
districts in which the planned unit development is located, and the minimum
dimensions established for the design of courts shall not be reduced. Where
yards, coverage or density of individual building sites or lots are reduced
within a planned unit development, a compensating open space or spaces shall be
provided within the planned unit development;
      4.   Minimum Site Size: In order to encourage the use of the planned unit
development provisions, there shall be no minimum site size requirements;
      5.   Off Street Parking: The off street parking requirements set forth in
this chapter may be complied with by providing one or more permanent, common,
off street parking facilities for all uses within the development, provided
that the facility contains the requisite number of spaces for each use, and
that the spaces provided for permanent residents shall be clearly designated
and separated from spaces provided for employees, customers and service. The
total spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the individual
requirements and the spaces required for each use, and shall be under the
ownership or permanent control of the owners of the use for which the spaces
are required; and
      6.   Subdivision Regulations: A planned unit development proposal may
also provide for modification of the requirements within the city's subdivision
regulations. The development plan required herein shall be considered as the
preliminary plat under the subdivision regulations and shall be reviewed at the
same time as the planned unit development request under the provisions of this
chapter. (Prior code § 16-30)
12-342: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES:
   A.   Application And Development Plan: The developer of a planned unit
development shall submit a site development plan in support of the application
for a planned unit development approval. The development plan shall be reviewed
in conjunction with any requisite rezoning and subdivision procedures in the
same manner as prescribed for rezoning requests.
   B.   Development Plan: The development plan required in support of a planned
unit development request shall include, at a minimum, the total acreage to be
developed, location of all structures, streets, driveways, parking areas, lot
and yard areas, open spaces, drainage plans, approximate utility locations, and
rights of way easements. In addition, building floor plans and elevations shall
be submitted.
   C.   Procedure: Procedures are as follows:
      1.   The planning commission and city council shall review the
development plan at public hearings and may recommend modification thereof or
request additional information. Either body may table action on the development
plan as necessary to allow modification of the development plan; and
      2.   Upon approval of a development plan by the city council, the plan
shall be adopted by ordinance and shall become a part of the zoning districts
map, subject to the conditions and requirements of the adopting ordinance.
   D.   Plan Changes: Any substantial deviation from the plans submitted at the
time of rezoning shall constitute a violation of the rezoning and substantial
change in plans shall be resubmitted for review following the same procedure
required in the original adoption of the plan. The chief enforcement officer
shall interpret what constitutes a "substantial" deviation or change in the
plan.
   E.   Construction: The construction of the planned unit development shall be
started within two (2) years of the effective date of approval of the plan by
the city council. Failure to begin the development within the two (2) years
shall automatically void the development plan and land shall revert to the same
zoning classification which existed immediately preceding the approval of the
planned unit development.
   F.   Homeowners' Association: If other satisfactory arrangements for
improving, operating and maintaining streets, common parking and open space
areas, drives, service areas and utilities have not been made with the city, a
"homeowners' association" shall be provided for and created, in accordance with
accepted procedures, state law, and financial requirements. (Prior code § 16-
30)

block are nearer to the street right-of-way than permitted above, a carport may
be permitted to extend in line with the nearest principal structure which
exceeds the prescribed setback provided that in no instance shall any portion
of a carport be permitted to encroach upon a public street right-of-way; and
         c.   The provisions of this section shall not be interpreted as
permitting construction in excess of the limitations on lot coverage set forth

12-390: PROCEDURE FOR AUTHORIZING USES PERMITTED ON REVIEW:
   A.   Procedure: The uses listed under the various districts herein as "uses
permitted on review" are so classified because they more intensely dominate the
area in which they are located than do other uses permitted in the district;
however, the nature of such uses makes it desirable that they be permitted to
locate therein. The following procedure is established to integrate properly
the uses permitted on review with the other land uses located in the district.
These uses shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following
procedures:
      1.   An application shall be filed with the city planning commission for
review. The application shall show the location and intended use of the site,
and be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all the property
owners and existing land uses within three hundred feet (300'), in any
direction of the proposed use, which lists shall be certified as correct by an
abstractor;
      2.   After giving notice of at least ten (10) days to all those whose
names appear on the list accompanying the application, the city planning
commission shall hold one or more public hearings thereon, at which time the
planning commission may require any other material it believes pertinent and
shall continue the hearing from time to time, if necessary;
      3.   The planning commission shall within forty five (45) days of the
date of application, transmit to the city council its report as to the effect
of such proposed building or use upon character of the neighborhood, traffic
conditions, public utilities and other matters pertaining to the general
welfare, and the recommendation of the planning commission concerning use
thereon. Thereupon the city council may authorize or deny the issuance of a
building permit or occupancy permit for the use of land or buildings as
requested;
      4.   The council by resolution shall set such fees as are necessary to
defray the costs of the mailing of the notice set out herein; and
      5.   Once received from the state issuing authority, the operator of a
daycare home (family daycare home) or daycare center shall provide a copy of
its license to the administrative office of the planning commission. (Ord.
1427, 2-25-1997)
   B.   Uses Permitted On Review; Specific Standards:

         a.   Type Of Business: Tattoo parlor or body piercing establishment
shall be a stand alone business.
         b.   Location Requirements: A tattoo parlor or body piercing
establishment shall not be located within one thousand feet (1,000') from a
church, school, or playground. Distance is measured from entry or exit into or
from the facility, or any place on the property of the facility where tattooing
or body piercing may be observed, whichever is closer and may be measured to
the nearest property line of a church, school, playground or other tattoo
parlor or body piercing establishment. (Ord. 1640, 10-24-2006)
12-391: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   The city council may amend the regulations and district boundaries
herein established on its own motion, on recommendation of the planning
commission, or upon petition. No amendment shall become effective until after
public hearings and referral to the planning commission for report and
recommendations thereon.
   B.   Amendment of the district boundaries upon petition from one or more
property owners shall require notice of hearing to be mailed to all property
owners within three hundred feet (300') of the request by first class mail not
less than twenty (20) days prior to the hearing and publication of notice in a
newspaper of general circulation not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing. Petitions for changes in the district boundaries herein established
shall be submitted to the office of the planning commission on forms approved
by the planning commission and shall be accompanied by:
      1.   A listing of the names and addresses of all owners of property
within a three hundred foot (300') radius of the property under consideration,
certified as true and accurate by an abstractor;
      2.   A filing fee as may be established by the city council; and
      3.   Such other information as may be required by the planning
commission.
Additionally, persons petitioning for a change in district boundaries shall be
responsible for the cost of publication of notices thereof.
   C.   Amendment of the regulations, restrictions and district boundaries
initiated by city council motion or upon recommendation of the planning
commission shall require publication of notice of hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing thereon.
(Prior code § 16-51)
12-392: ADOPTION OF AMENDMENT:

public hearings thereon. If protests to such amendment are filed at least three
(3) days before the date of public hearings by:
      1.   The owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the area included in
the proposed change; or
      2.   The owners of fifty percent (50%) or more of the properties within a
three hundred foot (300') radius of the proposed change,
the proposed amendment or change shall not become effective except by a
favorable vote by three-fifths (3/5) of the city council. (Prior code § 16-51)
12-393: VIOLATION AND PENALTY:

improvement or alteration of any existing structure on any tract of land which
does not comply with all of the provisions of this chapter.

punishable by fine. Any person, firm or corporation who violates or refuses to
comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined as provided in
section
1-108 of this code, including costs for each offense. Each day a violation is
permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense.
   C.   If any building, structure or land is in violation of these
regulations, the proper local authorities of the municipality, or any other
person affected thereby, in addition to other remedies, may institute
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent any unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or
use; to restrain, correct or abate any violation; to prevent the unlawful
occupancy of the building, structure or land; or to prevent any illegal act,
conduct, business or use in or about the premises.

and adopted policies and regulations.
      4.   To harmoniously relate the development of various tracts of land to
the existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining
tracts.
      5.   To provide that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the

land subdivision. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-403: AUTHORITY:
These regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority granted in 19 Oklahoma
Statutes sections 866.12 and 866.13. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-404: JURISDICTION:
   A.   These regulations shall apply to the incorporated area of the city,
insofar as they have been adopted by the planning commission and approved by
the city council.
   B.   These regulations shall apply to all of the unincorporated area of the
county which is located within three (3) miles of the city limits, or within
one-fourth (1/4) mile of any state or federal highway, or which is within one-
half (1/2) mile of any reservoir or water supply owned by the city, insofar as
they have been adopted by the planning commission and approved by the board of
county commissioners and the city council. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-405: APPLICATION TO FORMS OF SUBDIVIDING:
   A.   These regulations shall apply to the following forms of land
subdivision:
      1.   The division of land into two (2) or more tracts, lots, sites, or
parcels, any part of which, when subdivided, shall contain less than ten (10)
acres in area;
      2.   The division of land, previously subdivided or platted, into tracts,
lots, sites or parcels of less than ten (10) acres in area;

12-406: APPLICATION TO UNDEVELOPED PLATS:
   A.   The planning commission does hereby exercise the authority to pass and
approve development of plat subdivisions of land already recorded in the office
of the county clerk if such plats are partially or entirely undeveloped. A plat
shall be considered to be entirely or partially undeveloped if:
      1.   The plat has been recorded with the county clerk's office without
prior approval by the planning commission, or
      2.   The plat has been approved by the planning commission where approval
was granted more than three (3) years prior to granting a building permit, or
construction of streets and utilities, on the partially or entirely undeveloped
land. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-407: INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY:
   A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   The regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul
any other ordinance, rule or regulations, statute, or other provision of law.
Where any provision of these regulations imposes restriction different from
those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions
are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
   C.   If any section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these
regulations shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause,
paragraph provision or portion of these regulations. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-408: CONDITIONS:
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state. The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable
conditions laid down by the planning commission for design, dedication,
improvement, and restrictive use of the land so as to conform to the physical
and economical development of the municipality and to the safety and general
welfare of the future plot owners in the subdivision and of the community at
large. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-409: RESUBDIVISION OF LAND:
   A.   For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if
such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved
thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan
legally reached prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling
subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the planning commission by the
same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
   B.   Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows
one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building
sites, the planning commission may require that such parcel of land allow for
the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets.
Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be
made a requirement of the plat. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-410: VACATION OF PLATS:
   A.   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time prior to the sale of any lot therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated.
   B.   Such instrument shall be approved by the planning commission in like
manner as plats of subdivisions. The governing body may reject any such
instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public
uses, improvements, streets, or alleys.
   C.   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly recorded or
filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the
plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys, and
public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such plat.

12-411: VARIANCES:
   A.   Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured;
provided that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent
and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the planning commission
shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the
evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to where other property is located;
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; and
      4.   The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
zoning ordinance, master plan or official map.
   B.   In approving variances, the planning commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   C.   A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the
subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for the consideration
of the planning commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner. (Res. 901, 5-
10-1977)

12-420: GENERAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   Plats: For all cases of subdividing within the scope of these
regulations, as defined in section
12-405 of this chapter, a plat shall be drawn and submitted to the planning
commission for approval or disapproval. All subdivisions located within the
corporate limits of the city shall then be submitted to the city council for
acceptance of public streets, alleys, easements, and areas dedicated to public
use. All subdivisions located within the unincorporated portions of the county
which are within the jurisdiction of the planning commission shall be submitted
to the board for its acceptance of public streets, alleys, easements, and areas
dedicated to public use.
   B.   Phases: The subdivision process prescribed in these regulations shall
consist of three (3) phases:
      1.   Sketch plat;
      2.   Preliminary plat and improvement plans; and
      3.   Final plat. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
   C.   Exceptions To Regulations:
      1.   Lot Splits: Whenever there is a tract or previously subdivided
parcel of land, under single ownership, which is to be resubdivided into four
(4) or fewer lots, the proposed subdivision may be excepted from the procedural
requirements of this code (i.e., preliminary and final plats are not required);
however, this shall not constitute an exception from the design and improvement
requirements herein contained. These exceptions, or "lot splits", shall be
permitted under the following provisions:
         a.   An accurate survey plat of the proposed tract, and the
resubdivision thereof, prepared by a land surveyor registered in the state of
Oklahoma, shall be submitted to the planning commission.
         b.   The planning commission shall review the proposed "lot split" to
ensure compliance with all design and improvement requirements of this code.
         c.   Unusable parcels shall not be created as a result of any "lot
split".
         d.   Tracts or lots subdivided to accommodate an existing encroachment
shall be conveyed jointly until encroachment no longer exists.
         e.   Provision of street right of way easements in accordance with
this code.

plat by signing the said document.
         g.   Upon denial, the reason(s) for denial shall be stated in writing
and transmitted to the applicant.
         h.   Whenever a variance is requested from improvement standards, or a
street or other improvement is to be dedicated, the city council shall have
final approval and acceptance rights; for all other lot splits, the action of
the planning commission shall be final.
         i.   A tract of land which has been subject to "lot splits" involving
more than five (5) lots over any period of time shall not be allowed further
use of the "lot split" exception; said tract shall be subject to the procedures
contained herein for the platting of land.
      2.   Lot Line Adjustment:
         a.   Intent: The intent of a lot line adjustment is to address
existing problems pertaining to building encroachment, irregular shaped lots,
nonconforming lot sizes or to modify lot lines to promote orderly and efficient
community growth.
         b.   Approval By Community Development Director: Unless referred by
the community development director to the planning commission for review as
hereinafter provided, the community development director shall approve or
conditionally approve a lot line adjustment without notice or hearing subject
to the following provisions:
            (1)   A greater or lesser number of lots are not created by any
"lot line adjustment".
            (2)   No "lot line adjustment" shall be allowed unless all required
improvements are either completed, and accepted by the city, or their
construction is secured under the applicable provisions of this code.
            (3)   All proposed parcels or building sites involved in a "lot
line adjustment" shall abut on either an existing alley or adequate utility
easement, and on a publicly dedicated street.
            (4)   The adjusted lots in a "lot line adjustment" shall meet the
building site dimensions for the district in which the lot is located, with
respect to configuration and access to public streets, or if the lots do not
meet these requirements, the adjusted lots do not increase the degree of
nonconformity.
            (5)   The "lot line adjustment" does not create any lot which does
not meet the minimum lot width and area standards for the zone district in
which it is located.
            (6)   The "lot line adjustment" does not increase the degree of
nonconformance of structures, lots, or other factors with respect to zoning
standards.

or denied by the community development director, with the right of appeal to
the planning commission. (Ord. 1619, 2-14-2006)
   D.   Submission For Approval: Each sketch plat, preliminary plat and final
plat submitted for approval shall be placed on the agenda of the planning
commission only after fulfilling the appropriate requirements of these
regulations. However, a plat not meeting all of the requirements may be
submitted providing the subdivider presents with the plat a written request for
specific exceptions and enumerates in detail the reasons therefor.

period required for formal approval or disapproval of the plat shall commence
to run. (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
12-421: SKETCH PLAT:

sewage disposal, drainage, lot arrangement, the future development of adjacent
land, and the provisions of the general plan and other ordinances and
resolutions affecting land development use.

commission when one or more of the following conditions exists:
      1.   If a sketch plat accompanies a rezoning request;
      2.   If subdivider requests arbitration of recommendation of the
administrative officer;

significantly at variance with an adopted neighborhood plan;
      5.   If the sketch plat proposes any variance from the standards
established in these regulations; and
      6.   If for any reason, the administrative officer believes the planning
commission should review the sketch plat before consideration of the

scheduled hearing, and any adjourned date thereof, and shall approve,
conditionally approve, or disapprove the preliminary plat within sixty (60)
days of the official submission date, unless continuance is agreed upon by the
subdivider. If the preliminary plat is conditionally approved or disapproved,
the reasons for such action shall be stated in writing and signed by the
planning commission chairman and attached to a copy of the plat and transmitted
to the subdivider.
   E.   The approval of a preliminary plat shall not be subject to any
termination date provided that any plat undeveloped for a period of more than
three (3) years from the date of preliminary plat approval shall be reviewed
for compliance with subsequent amendments to the ordinances and resolutions
governing the subdivision and use of land as specified in section
12-406 of this chapter.
   F.   Prior to approval of a final plat the planning commission may permit
the preliminary plat to be divided into two (2) or more sections and may impose

official submission date, approve, modify and approve, or disapprove the
subdivision application by resolution which shall set forth any conditions to
which the approval is subject, or reasons for disapproval. In the resolution,
the planning commission shall stipulate the period of time when the performance
bond shall be filed or the required improvements installed, whichever is
applicable. In no event shall a performance bond be submitted later than six
(6) months from the date of the final resolution. In no case shall the period
of time for the completion of improvements exceed two (2) years from the date
of the final resolution.

planning commission as sufficient to secure to the local government the
satisfactory completion of required improvements; provided that signing of the
final plat shall not be accomplished prior to compliance with this section.

shall the standard be less than the applicable city or county specifications;
      2.   Whenever a subdivision contains a major street that requires a
street facility that is more costly than is required to serve the future
occupants of the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to pay only the
portion of the cost of the major street that would equal the cost of an
improvement required to serve only the subdivision, as determined by the
planning commission; and (Res. 901, 5-10-1977)
      3.   All driveways which connect with public streets shall be constructed
in accordance with "driveway standards for the city of Duncan, Oklahoma"

12-441: PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:
   A.   Purpose: To provide for private sewage disposal systems located in the
Stagestand Creek drainage basin to connect to existing public sewage disposal
systems in the Claridy, Willow and Cow Creek drainage basins.
   B.   When Permitted; Sanitation: Where a public sanitary sewer is not
reasonably accessible within the city or in any area under the jurisdiction of
the city per section
12-437 of this chapter, the building sewer may be connected to a private sewage
disposal system that is connected to the existing public sewage collection
system. Before approval of a final plat for land subdivision or issuance of a
building permit for any new building that is to be served by a private sewage
disposal system that is to be connected to the existing public sewer collection
system, the applicant must demonstrate to the city that the following
requirements have been met:
      1.   Availability of excess sewer capacity in the Cow Creek, Willow
Creek, or Claridy Creek drainage basins for peak design flow(s) up to eighty
five percent (85%) of "excess sewer capacity" as defined herein;
      2.   Such private sewage disposal system shall be designed, constructed,
maintained and operated at all times in a sanitary manner as required by the
Oklahoma department of environmental quality, Stephens County department of
health, and the city;
      3.   Applicant provision of private easements for all off site portions
of the private sewage disposal system;
      4.   Applicant shall provide operation and maintenance of the private
sewage disposal system, including establishing funding in a form acceptable to
the city based upon projected operating and maintenance costs of the private
sewage disposal system as identified by an engineer, until such time as the
private system can be dedicated and accepted by the city as a public system, as
defined herein;
      5.   Gravity portion of the system shall comply with provisions in
chapter 5, article C of this part;
      6.   Private sewage disposal system shall be designed, constructed and
maintained to serve all contiguous land owned by the applicant; and
      7.   On site private sewage disposal system constructed for eventual
connection to public system:
         a.   The private sewage disposal system has been designed to ensure a
sanitary sewer service line stub is in a location sufficient to facilitate
future connection to a public sanitary sewer system, as determined by the city
engineer.
         b.   At such time that a public sanitary sewer line becomes reasonably
accessible to any property served by a private sewage disposal system, the
landowner(s) shall be required to discontinue use of the private sewage
disposal system and connect to the public sanitary sewer system in accordance
with the time frames for compliance specified below:
            (1)   Within two (2) years from the date that the public sanitary
sewer line became reasonably accessible to the property; or
            (2)   Immediately, or as soon as practicable thereafter as
determined by the city engineer, upon evidence of failure of the existing
private sewage disposal system; or
            (3)   Within thirty (30) days of a change in ownership of the
property.
         c.   The property owner(s) shall sign and record with the Stephens
County clerk's office an affidavit of disclosure stating that they agree to
suspend use of the private sewage disposal system and connect to a public
sanitary sewer system when it is reasonably accessible to the property in
accordance with the time frames for compliance specified above, whichever one
occurs first with filing of final plat or issuance of building permit.
   C.   Discontinuance Standards: Whenever the use of a private sewage system
is discontinued due to a voluntary or mandatory connection to the public
sanitary sewer system in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the
property owner shall fill any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private
sewage facilities shall be filled with suitable material in accordance with
state and county regulations within ninety (90) days after discontinuance.
   D.   Appeals: An appeal from any action, decision, ruling, judgment of an
administrative official or board or commission may be taken by any person or
persons, jointly or severally, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department,
board or commission of the city to the district court.

schedule approved by city council setting forth such rates, shall apply to
properties on private lift stations in the Stagestand Creek drainage basin
until such time as the property is connected to a public sewage disposal system
in the Stagestand Creek drainage basin.
   F.   Penalty: Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this
section shall be assessed a penalty as provided for by section
1-108 of this code. (Ord. 1680, 10-27-2009)
ARTICLE D.  DESIGN
12-450: MINIMUM STANDARDS AND GENERAL POLICIES:
   A.   The standards and policies for development contained in these
regulations, the zoning regulations, the building code, the major street plan
and other regulations governing land development are established as minimum
standards. However, the general plan expresses policies which are intended to
achieve optimum quality of urban development. If only the minimum standards are
followed, as expressed by the various regulations affecting land development, a
standardization of development will occur. This will produce a monotonous urban
setting. Subdivision design should be of a quality to carry out the purpose and
spirit of the policies expressed in the general plan and in these regulations
rather than be limited to the minimum standards required herein.
   B.   The minimum design standards established in these regulations shall
provide the basic criteria for the evaluation of proposed subdivision. The
planning commission may, however, establish reasonable design requirements in
excess of the established minimum standards where by reason of exceptional
topographic, hydrologic, or other physical feature the strict adherence to
these standards will result in an inappropriate subdivision design. (Res. 901,
5-10-1977)
12-451: URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
   A.   The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of
design of the individual subdivisions that compose it. Good community design
requires the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer of
land within the urban area. Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be
prepared in accordance with the principles established by the general plan for
land, circulation, community facilities and public utility services and in
accordance with the following general principles:
      1.   It is intended that the urban area should be designed as a group of
integrated residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial and industrial
and public facilities. The neighborhood as a planning unit is intended as an
area principally for residential use, and is of a size that can be served by
one elementary school. Space for religious, recreational, education and
shopping facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be
provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood;
      2.   The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential,
commercial, industrial and public uses should be designed to provide adequate
light, air, open space, landscaping, off street parking and loading facilities;
      3.   The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical
features. Tree masses and large individual trees should be preserved. The
system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take
advantage of the visual qualities of the area; and
      4.   Circulation within the urban area shall be provided in accordance
with the following design criteria:
         a.   Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all
arterial streets and highways as shown on the major street plan. Arterial
streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood;
         b.   Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel
of land within the residential neighborhood and within industrial areas, and in
a manner that will discourage use by through traffic. They should be planned so
that future urban expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets to
arterial routes;
         c.   Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route
from other minor streets to the major street system;
         d.   Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided
only on minor streets; and
         e.   Pedestrianways should be separated from roadways used by
vehicular traffic. Sidewalks should be designed to provide all residential
building sites with direct access to all neighborhood facilities, including the
elementary school, parks, playgrounds, churches and shopping centers. (Res.
901, 5-10-1977)
12-452: SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of
streets shall conform to all of the elements of the general plan and shall be
designed in accordance with the following provisions:
      1.   Major streets shall be planned to conform with the major street
plan;
      2.   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major street, the planning commission may require service streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
arterial and local traffic;
      3.   Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by arterial
traffic will be discouraged;
      4.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way
or limited access highway right of way, the planning commission may require a
street approximately parallel to, and on each side of such right of way at a
distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such
distances also shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separation structures;
      5.   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is placed in the city or county under conditions
approved by the planning commission;
      6.   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical location
and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for
adequate utility easements;
      7.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') should be avoided;
      8.   Street right of way widths shall be in accordance with the major
street plan and, where not designated therein, shall be not less than the
following:
 
Major Streets
 
Primary with median              120 feet
Primary without median           100 feet
Secondary with or without median 80 feet
 
Minor Streets
 
Collector                        60 feet
Minor                            50 feet
Cul-de-sac                       50 feet
 
      9.   The grades of all streets shall not exceed the following, except
where unusual topographic conditions justify in the opinion of the planning
commission, a modification of these standards:
 
Major Streets
 
Primary                            5 percent
Secondary                          7 percent
 
Minor Streets                      10 percent
 
No street grade shall be less than 0.5 percent
 
      10.   The paved width of all streets shall be adequate to serve the
existing and future terminated traffic load for the facility. Lane widths for
all streets shall be as follows:
         a.   All major streets shall have lanes for traffic movement of not
less than eleven feet (11') or more than twelve feet (12') in width and lanes
for parallel parking or emergency stopping of not less than ten feet (10') in
width;
         b.   All minor streets shall have lanes for traffic movement of not
less than ten feet (10') or more than twelve feet (12') in width and lanes for
parallel parking of not less than six feet (6') in width; and
         c.   Streets shall conform to the standards illustrated by figure 1,
design standards for urban streets.
      11.   A cul-de-sac shall not exceed five hundred feet (500') in length,
measured from the nearest point providing two (2) directional through traffic
to the center of the turnaround. If a cul-de-sac is more than one hundred fifty
feet (150') in length it shall be provided with a turnaround having a radius of
not less than forty feet (40') at the curb line. There should be provided in
the center of the turnaround an unpaved island, which has a radius of not less
than twelve feet (12') nor more than twenty five feet (25'). Any unpaved island
shall be improved with grass and landscaping in such a manner that it will not
interfere with sight distance;
      12.   Half streets shall be prohibited except where they are essential to
the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and provided that the planning commission
finds it will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the
street easement when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half
street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street
shall be platted within such tract;
      13.   The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in
the subdividing of adjacent properties. The planning commission may require the
dedication of street rights of way to facilitate the development of adjoining
properties; and
      14.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the planning commission.
   B.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the planning commission may waive this requirement where other definite
and assured provision is made for service access, such as off street loading,
unloading, and parking consistent with that adequate for the uses proposed:
      1.   Alleys serving commercial and industrial areas shall not be less
than thirty feet (30') in width;
      2.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment should be
avoided; but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit
safe vehicular movement; and
      3.   Dead end alleys should be avoided; but where necessary, facilities
at the dead end may be permitted, as determined by the planning commission.
   C.   Where alleys are not provided, easements for public and private
utilities shall be provided along rear lot lines and side lot lines where
necessary. Easements along rear and side lot lines shall be, wherever possible,
centered along the lot lines with a total width of twenty feet (20'). Where
appropriate, the planning commission may allow easements with a minimum width
of fifteen feet (15'). The planning commission may require aerial easements and
easements of greater width for the extension of main storm and sanitary sewers
and other utilities where it is deemed necessary.
   D.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage channel or
stream, which drains one hundred sixty (160) acres or more of land, there shall
be provided a right of way for drainage and public parks and public utility
purposes, adequate to contain all of the runoff from a 50-year maximum flood.
The right of way shall include all of the land within the subdivision that has
an elevation that will remain below the 50-year maximum flood elevation which
shall be calculated in accordance with, and shall be adequate to provide for,
the drainage requirements of the ordinances and regulations relating thereto.
   E.   Public parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other public areas and
open spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements and standards
set forth in the general plan and in the ordinances and regulations relating
thereto.
   F.   Where a sketch plat contains an area reserved for public use, in
accordance with this section, the planning commission shall refer such sketch
plat, with recommendations, to the governing body for resolution of the
governing body's intent to accept such dedication in accordance with the
ordinances and regulations relating thereto.
   G.   Where the proposed public area or open space is rejected by the
governing body, the subdivider shall revise the sketch plat so as to
incorporate the area into the lots and blocks of the proposed subdivision and
submit the revised sketch plat to the planning commission.
   H.   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard for the following:
      1.   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear
property line of such lots;
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major arterial; and
      3.   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable
points).
   I.   Residential lots, with the exception of townhouses, shall not be less
than fifty feet (50') in width at the front building line and shall abut a
street a distance of not less than thirty feet (30'); except that a corner lot
shall be not less than sixty feet (60') in width at the front building line.
   J.   Side lot lines should be approximately at right angles or radial to
street lines.
   K.   The depth of residential lots should be not less than one hundred
twenty feet (120') exclusive of any drainage easement.
   L.   The area of a residential lot, exclusive of townhouse development,
shall not be less than six thousand (6,000) square feet.
   M.   In residential subdivisions where septic tank or individual sewage
disposal devices are to be installed, the area of the lot shall be not less
than twenty two thousand five hundred (22,500) square feet if to be served by
public water, or thirty five thousand (35,000) square feet if to be served by a
private water source. In no case shall a lot served by an individual sewage
disposal system have a width of less than one hundred twenty feet (120') at the
front building line.
   N.   Lots are not required for subdivisions for commercial and industrial
use, but when provided they should be of appropriate size and arrangement to
provide for adequate off street parking and loading facilities based on the
intended use.
   O.   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except
where they are needed to provide for the separation of development from
arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation. A planting screen easement of at least twenty feet (20') in width
shall be provided along the portion of the lots abutting such a traffic artery
or other use where screening is required. There shall be no right of access
across a planting screen easement.
   P.   Building lines shall be provided for all residential subdivisions as
follows:
      1.   A front building line shall be located at least twenty five feet
(25') back of the street right of way line;
      2.   A side yard building line on the side of a corner lot abutting the
street shall be located not less than fifteen feet (15') back of the street
right of way when such lot is back to back with another corner lot and not less
than twenty feet (20') back of the street right of way line in every other
case;
      3.   A side yard building line shall be provided not less than five feet
(5') back of a crosswalk right of way or easement line on the side of a lot
abutting a midblock crosswalk; and
      4.   Restrictions requiring buildings to be located within the building
lines shown on the plat shall be set forth on the plat or on a separate
recorded instrument.
   Q.   Whenever a subdivision is developed as a planned unit development under
the provisions of the zoning regulations, wherein adequate park or playground
area is provided, through traffic is cared for adequately and the majority of
the minor streets are of the cul-de-sac or loop type, the planning commission
may vary the requirements of this article in order to allow the subdivider more

ARTICLE A.  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND METHODS
12-601: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City of Duncan, Oklahoma, ordains the following, to become
effective immediately. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)
12-602: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Duncan are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)
12-603: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)
12-604: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)

Zones AE, A, and X, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: Means for the purposes of determining rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of
the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date.
"Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: Means a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the areas within City of Duncan subject to a "special flood hazard" and the
extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized
flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.

are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: Means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of section 60.3 of title 44 CFR.
MANUFACTURED HOME: Means a structure transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

flood elevations shown on the City of Duncan's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which
the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by the City of Duncan City Council and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: Means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the City of Duncan
Floodplain Board.
OWRB: Means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: Means a vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: Means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of
construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: Is a grant of relief by the City of Duncan City Council to a person
from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full
requirements see section 60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
VIOLATION: Means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: Means the height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)
ARTICLE C.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

12-612: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Duncan or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1781, 7-
10-2018)
ARTICLE D.  ADMINISTRATION

   I.   When a floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain Administrator
must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zone AE as delineated on
the Stephens County FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the City of Duncan.
   J.   After a disaster or other type of damage occurrence to structures in
the City of Duncan, determine if the residential and non-residential structures
and manufactured homes have been substantially damaged, and enforce the

the City Council.
   L.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)
12-615: PERMIT PROCEDURES:
   A.   An application for a development permit shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
      1.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and
      2.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential

drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   B.   In addition to the information required herein, the Floodplain
Administrator may require engineering, hydrologic or other information and
studies sufficient to determine compliance with this chapter.
   C.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;

conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
      8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
      10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area.
   D.   The Floodplain Administrator or Board of Adjustment, as applicable, may
approve certain development in Zones A or AE delineated on the Stephens County
FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than
one foot (1'), provided that the applicant for the development permit in that
case first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12. (Ord. 1781, 7-10-2018)
12-616: VARIANCES:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   The Board of Adjustment of the City of Duncan may grant variances
for uses which do not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or this chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents
adequate proof that: a) compliance with this chapter will result in an
arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or
advantage to the people and b) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this
article. However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance
will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates
flooding hazards.
      2.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the State.
      3.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
twenty (20) years.
      4.   Any person seeking a variance shall file an appeal in accordance
with section
12-126 of this part.
      5.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection
12-615C of this article and provisions of this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      6.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the Chairman of the Board of
Adjustment which states that: a) the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to
be built lower than the base flood elevation, and b) such construction below
the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
      7.   At such time as the Board of Adjustment deems the petition ready for
notification to the public, the Board of Adjustment shall schedule a hearing
and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in Stephens County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
      8.   The Board of Adjustment shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this article.
The Board of Adjustment shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities
involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the
public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
      9.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
         d.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      10.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the
intent of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to
the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives stated in section
12-603 of this chapter.
      11.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the Board of Adjustment shall be sent by the Floodplain
Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of
the variance.
   B.   Special Provisions:
      1.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.

ARTICLE E.  PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
12-617: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:
   A.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   B.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   C.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   D.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   F.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
   G.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
   H.   Any development within the scope of these regulations shall comply with
all conditions and plans as approved and contained within the development
permit.

12-701: PURPOSE:
This plan for major streets is intended to promote the orderly development and
use of land within the existing and future urban area; to eliminate existing
traffic congestion and facilitate the rapid, safe and efficient movement of
traffic and to make provision for anticipated future traffic needs, and to
permit the acquisition of right of way for major streets and highways in a way
that will effect maximum economy for the city and convenience and utility for
the private property owner. (Prior code § 16-56)
12-702: TITLE AND RELATIONSHIP TO GENERAL PLAN:
This plan shall be designated as the major street plan and shall be a part of
the general plan for the city and the Duncan metropolitan area. (Prior code §
16-57)
12-703: FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF STREETS:
   A.   For the purpose of identification, streets and highways shall be
defined and classified by functions as follows:
    COLLECTOR STREET: A street located within a neighborhood or integrated use
area which collects traffic from minor streets and which forms the most direct
route to a major street or a community facility.
   EXPRESSWAY: An arterial route having an existing or potential traffic demand
which requires two (2) or more lanes for moving traffic each direction, where
opposing traffic lanes are separated by traffic islands or medians and where
access is fully or partially controlled.
   LOCAL STREET: Any street classified as an expressway, primary thoroughfare
or secondary thoroughfare.
   MAJOR STREET: Any street classified as an expressway, primary thoroughfare
or secondary thoroughfare.
   MINOR STREET: Any street classified as a collector street or a local street.
   PRIMARY THOROUGHFARES: An arterial route where access is only partially
controlled where traffic loads do not justify the design of an expressway.
   SECONDARY THOROUGHFARES: An arterial route which is similar to the primary
thoroughfare, but with limitations of easement width and traffic load. (Prior
code § 16-58)
12-704: MAJOR STREETS AND COLLECTORS DESIGNATED:
Major streets and collector streets shall be those which are designated on the
official major street plan map. The map and all explanatory material thereon is
hereby made a part of this plan and these regulations. In undeveloped areas the
metropolitan area planning commission will determine the classification of
proposed streets in accordance with the provisions of this plan and the
"Standards And Regulations For The Subdivision Of Land Of The Duncan
Metropolitan Area Planning Commission". (Prior code § 16-59)
12-705: EASEMENT WIDTHS AND DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   The maximum easement width, which it shall be the developer's
responsibility to provide, shall be as follows:
 
Expressway Negotiated
Primary    100 feet
Secondary  80 feet
Collector  60 feet
Minor      50 feet
 
   B.   The design standards for major and minor streets should be in
accordance with the provisions contained in figure 1 whenever it is deemed
feasible by the planning commission. (Prior code § 16-60)
12-706: SETBACK REQUIREMENTS FOR MAJOR STREETS:
No building or structure shall be located within the setback lines herein
established, except as otherwise designated in these regulations. Setback lines
are hereby established parallel to and on both sides of the right of way of all
major streets in accordance with the following schedule, except as otherwise
designated in section
12-704 of this chapter:
COLLECTOR STREET: On all collector streets, setback lines are hereby
established parallel to and a distance of fifty five feet (55') from the
centerline thereof, but not less than twenty five feet (25') from the outside
edge of the easement line.
EXPRESSWAY: On all expressways, setback lines are hereby established parallel
to and distant eighty five feet (85') from the centerline of the easement, but
not less than twenty five feet (25') from the outside edge of the easement.
PRIMARY THOROUGHFARE: On all primary thoroughfares, setback lines are hereby
established parallel to and distant seventy five feet (75') from the centerline
thereof, but not less than twenty five feet (25') from the outside edge of the
easement.
SECONDARY THOROUGHFARE: On all secondary thoroughfares, setback lines are
hereby established parallel to and distant sixty five feet (65') from the
centerline thereof, but not less than twenty five feet (25') from the outside
edge of the easement line. (Prior code § 16-61)
12-707: EXCEPTION TO SETBACK LINES ON CERTAIN MAJOR STREETS:
   A.   Because certain streets, which have been designated as major streets,
are located in areas where properties adjacent to the right of way are
partially or fully developed with buildings and the pattern of land use is
largely determined, the regulations, as set forth in section
12-701 of this chapter could not reasonably be applied. Therefore, setback

registered professional engineer and shall be as agreed upon by the developer/
owner and the DPUA at the time of the execution of the reimbursement schedule.
No area shall be included within the defined service area of more than one
reimbursement schedule.
   B.   Each tract of property identified in subsection A of this section shall
be subject to the total major water main extension cost participation expense
equal to such tract's pro rata share, any applicable right of way costs, and
inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the costs for each individual
tract shall be determined as follows:
      1.   Pro rata share = (b + c) x (d/a)
 
a = Total service area in square feet
b = Total improvement costs (not to include repairs, retests, replacement or
    other expenses to correct faulty workmanship or materials)
c = Total right of way costs
d = Individual benefiting tract in square feet
 
      2.   Right of way cost = Actual cost paid for acquisition of right of
way/utility easement from subject tract, including appraisal fees, attorney
fees, court costs and filing fees.
      3.   Inflation/deflation adjustment = Adjustment of subsections B1 and B2
of this section using an inflation factor calculated using the engineering news
record construction cost index. The inflation factor shall be a percentage
increase applied to subsections B1 and B2 of this section that adjusts the
amount due for these costs. The initial inflation factor will be calculated by
dividing the January 2000 value by the January 1990 value. To account for the
actual time between adoption of the resolution and repayment of the obligation,
the resulting increase will be divided by ten (10) and multiplied by the
decimal equivalent of the period covered measured in years. The inflation
factor will be recalculated every five (5) years with the first recalculation
occurring in January 2005. The value of the inflation factor in place at the
time the DPUA adopts the map and list for a project will be applied to that
project until all funds are paid back or the obligation expires. The total
payments calculated in this subsection B shall become a liability against
property subsequent to the contracting for water main extension.
   C.   For all residential plat subdivision developments, all reimbursement
charges shall be paid in full before the filing of a final plat. For all other
developments, all reimbursement charges shall be paid in full before the
issuance of a building permit. (Ord. 1611, 10-25-2005)
12-931: MAJOR SANITARY SEWER MAIN EXTENSION REIMBURSEMENT:
   A.   After completion of the major sanitary sewer main extension, the DPUA
will require any person, firm or corporation requesting a new sanitary sewer
service connection within the defined service area of the major sanitary sewer
main to pay to the developer/owner his pro rata portion of the original
investment of the developer/owner in the major sanitary sewer main, together
with interest thereon from the date of completion of the main at a rate not to
exceed six percent (6%) per annum, such pro rata portion to be calculated on a
square footage basis of the total defined service area of such major sanitary
sewer main. The total service area of such major sanitary sewer main shall
consist of that area of the sanitary sewer drainage basin flowing directly to
said major sanitary sewer main without benefit of any other major sanitary
sewer main as planned by the DPUA and shall be defined by a registered
professional engineer and shall be as agreed upon by the developer/owner and
the DPUA at the time of the execution of the reimbursement schedule. No area
shall be included within the defined service area of more than one
reimbursement schedule.
   B.   Each tract of property identified in subsection A of this section shall
be subject to the total major sewer main extension cost participation expense
equal to such tract's pro rata share, any applicable right of way costs, and
inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the costs for each individual
tract shall be determined as follows:
      1.   Pro rata share = (b + c) x (d/a)
 
a = Total service area in square feet
b = Total improvement costs (not to include repairs, retests, replacement or
    other expenses to correct faulty workmanship or materials)
c = Total right of way costs
d = Individual benefiting tract in square feet
 
      2.   Right of way cost = Actual price paid for acquisition of right of
way/utility easement from subject tract, including appraisal fees, attorney
fees, court costs and filing fees.
      3.   Inflation/deflation adjustment = Adjustment of subsections B1 and B2
of this section using an inflation factor calculated using the engineering news
record construction cost index. The inflation factor shall be a percentage
increase applied to subsections B1 and B2 of this section that adjusts the
amount due for these costs. The initial inflation factor will be calculated by
dividing the January 2000 value by the January 1990 value. To account for the
actual time between adoption of the resolution and repayment of the obligation,
the resulting increase will be divided by ten (10) and multiplied by the
decimal equivalent of the period covered measured in years. The inflation
factor will be recalculated every five (5) years with the first recalculation
occurring in January 2005. The value of the inflation factor in place at the
time the DPUA adopts the map and list for a project will be applied to that
project until all funds are paid back or the obligation expires. The total
payments calculated in this subsection B shall become a liability against the
property subsequent to the contracting for sewer main extension.
   C.   All such obligations shall be paid in full before the filing of a final
plat or development plan. (Ord. 1611, 10-25-2005)
12-932: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Prior to constructing a major water main extension or major sanitary
sewer main extension for which the developer/owner desires to recover a portion
of the cost of constructing said extension, the developer/owner shall submit an
application for reimbursement. The application for reimbursement shall be
submitted, reviewed, and approved by the general manager.
   B.   The application shall include the following information:
      1.   Name and address of the owner or developer making the application;
      2.   Plans and specifications for the major water and/or sanitary sewer
main extension prepared by a registered professional engineer and meeting the
approved standards and specifications, as established in this LDC, showing the
proposed new location of the new main, location of existing major water and/or
sanitary sewer mains in close proximity thereto, and the proposed point of
connection, costs of construction including, but not limited to, engineering
cost, off site right of way and easement acquisition costs and labor and
materials;
      3.   Legal descriptions of rights of way and easements to be dedicated to
the city of Duncan;
      4.   Current ownership map of the land within the defined service area of
the proposed major utility main extension.
   C.   Upon making application for reimbursement, the developer/owner, or his
designated agent, shall prepare a tract map and list of the individually
affected tracts and the estimated pro rata share attributable to each such
tract, hereinafter referred to as the "map and list". The map and list will
also include all costs, if any, for right of way acquisition to each tract. The
map and list shall be made available to the owners of the affected properties.
Notice of the map and list shall be filed on record in the office of the city
clerk and the Stephens County clerk. Upon written request to the general
manager, notice shall be given within a reasonable time to the requesting party
of the most current estimate of the dollar value of the participation cost of
any identified tract of property.
   D.   Any owner of a tract of property may, at any time after preparation of
the map and list, cause the tract's total obligation to be paid to the DPUA.
Unless previously paid, the proportion of the right of way cost and pro rata
share attributable to that portion of a tract being developed, as adjusted by
the engineering news record construction cost index, is due as follows: For any
portion of the subject tract that is proposed to develop as a residential
subdivision development, the reimbursement charges are due prior to approval of
the final plat. For any portion of the subject tract that is proposed to
develop as any land use other than residential, the reimbursement charges are
due prior to issuance of a building permit. No residential subdivision final
plat shall be released for filing until all total costs due are actually paid.
   E.   Each identified tract of property shall be subject to participation in
the reimbursement program commencing with the date that the major utility main
extension is accepted for dedication by the city of Duncan.
   F.   Unless previously paid, each defined tract's share of the participation
cost shall continue as an obligation of the property for its determined share
of the total utility main extension costs, plus the appropriate inflation/
deflation as outlined in subsection
12-930B3 or 12-931B3 of this chapter, for a period of fifteen (15) years from
the date of issuance of the map and list required by subsection C of this
section. Beginning at year sixteen (16) and continuing through year twenty
(20), the pro rata share shall decrease at a rate of twenty percent (20%) of
the pro rata amount existing at the end of the fifteenth year until the pro
rata share obligation is reduced to zero dollars ($0.00) and thus terminates at
the end of the twentieth year from the date of issuance of the map and list.

and any materials during construction. (Ord. 1387, 1-30-1996)
12-1015: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES:
   A.   It is the intent and purpose of this chapter that the primary component
of drainage systems shall be natural channels within drainage easement or
rights of way. Streets, alleys and enclosed conduits shall principally serve
and be designed to carry stormwater to natural channels in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter:
      1.   Open Channels: Natural drainage channels and techniques shall be
given priority consideration in preparation of drainage system designs and
shall be designed or improved as an integral part of the landscape:
         a.   The design of any development should provide for the maximum
practical use of open channels and natural streams;
         b.   Drainage channel improvements shall be designed to preserve and
protect large trees and other worthy botanical and geological features to the
greatest possible extent; and
         c.   Wherever channel improvements are required to accommodate
calculated flows in a specified manner, the designs shall provide maximum
utilization of turf, sodding and other natural drainage techniques;
      2.   Storm Sewers: Closed, underground drainage conduits should be
employed as appropriate to meet site or geographic conditions or to meet the
requirements of this chapter and all specifications and performance standards
pertaining thereto;
      3.   Streets And Alleys: Stormwater runoff into or within a street or
alley shall be permitted provided the developer fully and adequately
demonstrates that the street or alley or any improvement thereof will provide
drainage in full conformance with all other provisions of this chapter and will
prevent runoff or overflow into adjacent or nearby property beyond the capacity
of the existing or proposed drainage system;
      4.   Erosion Control: All persons engaged in land development or
modifications shall prevent the erosion of soil and movement of sedimentation
into, onto or through streets, gutters, catch basins, culverts or other
drainage channels and shall prevent erosion as a result of flows from streets,
gutters, culverts or other drainage system components:
         a.   Where it can be demonstrated that there is no alternative to
rapid runoff water because of identifiable restrictions, the developer shall be
required to provide measures to prevent erosion, damage, flooding or other
adverse effects; and
         b.   The city may require the cleaning, straightening or repair of any
natural drainage channel or natural features of other drainage channels when
necessary to provide for the free flow of water or to eliminate or prevent
erosion upstream and downstream. (Ord. 1387, 1-30-1996)
12-1016: DRAINAGE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA:
   A.   The following criteria shall be applied to the design of drainage
system improvements required under the provisions of this chapter. Drainage
system elements shall be designed to accommodate stormwater runoff based upon
full development of the contributing drainage basin area as indicated in the
latest general or land use plan for the city, or as determined by the public
works department in consultation with the engineer:
      1.   Detention Or Retention Facilities: Reserved;
      2.   Open Channels: Open channels, flumes or swales shall be designed to
carry the base flood within the limits of the dedicated easement or right of
way;
      3.   Storm Sewers: Storm sewers and appurtenances shall be designed in
accordance with the standards and practices of the Oklahoma department of
transportation. Storm sewers and appurtenances shall have the following minimum
performance criteria:

12-1101: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to require landscape elements,
particularly plant materials, within proposed developments in an organized and
harmonious fashion that will enhance, protect and promote the economic and
aesthetic environment of the City of Duncan, and provide for the prosperity,
comfort and enjoyment of its citizens. The City recognizes the value of
landscaping in achieving the following goals:
      1.   Promote the re-establishment of vegetation in urban areas for
health, ecological and aesthetic benefits.
      2.   Provide new planting in concert with natural vegetation and careful
grading.
      3.   Encourage the preservation of existing trees.
      4.   Promote compatibility between land uses by reducing the visual,
noise and lighting impacts of development on users of the site and abutting
properties.
      5.   Unify development, and enhance and define public and private places.
      6.   Provide an overall planting scheme that will:
         a.   Reduce soil erosion, and the volume and rate of discharge of
stormwater runoff.
         b.   Aid in energy conservation by shading and sheltering structures
from energy losses caused by weather and wind.
         c.   Mitigate the loss of natural resources.
         d.   Provide visual screens and buffers that mitigate the impact of
conflicting land uses to preserve the appearance, character and value of
existing neighborhoods.
         e.   Provide shade, comfort and seasonal color.
         f.   Reduce glare, noise and heat.
         g.   Provide greater perceptual clarity along major streets and roads
by more consistent planting of property sized street trees.
      7.   It is further recognized that good landscaping attracts potential
residents and businesses to the City of Duncan, and creates a safer, more
attractive and more pleasant living and working environment for all residents
and visitors of Duncan.
      8.   These regulations are intended at minimum standards for landscape
treatment. Owners and developers are encouraged to exceed this standard in
seeking more creative solutions, both for the enhanced value of their land and
for the collective health and enjoyment of all citizens of Duncan. (Ord. 1767,
6-27-2017)
12-1102: SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY:
All applicants for building permits to construct new buildings and/or parking
areas or to expand existing buildings and/or parking areas for any use
designated as "non-residential" per the International Code Council shall be
required to meet the provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter
do not apply to the construction or expansion of one and two family residential
dwellings or accessory structures, regardless of the zoning districts in which
they are located. (Ord. 1767, 6-27-2017)

(Ord. 1767, 6-27-2017)
12-1104: LANDSCAPE POINT SYSTEM:
   A.   Point System:
      1.   The minimum amount of landscaping required for an individual
development project is that amount of landscaping with a total point value (as
determined from the table below) equal to or exceeding the total required
landscape points, being the sum of the "site points" and the "parking lot
points". Site points are determined by the size of the developed area, and
parking lot points are determined by the number of parking spaces. For the
purposes of calculating landscape points, the developed area may be submitted
in the form of the legal description of the property or scaled, dimensioned and
well-defined area of development that is referenced on the site plan.
      2.   Number of landscaping points required:
 
Size Of Developed Area Number Of Points Required
Commercial development:       
                             Site points = 25
 1 to 5,000 square feet      Parking lot points = 2 points per required parking
                             space and 1 point for each proposed additional
                             parking space beyond required spaces
                             Site points = 25 plus 1 point for each additional
                             200 square feet of building area
 More than 5,000 square feet Parking lot points = 2 points per required parking
                             space and 1 point for each proposed additional
                             parking space beyond required spaces
Industrial development:       
                             Site points = 25
 1 to 5,000 square feet      Parking lot points = 2 points per required parking
                             space and 1 point for each proposed additional
                             parking space beyond required spaces
                             Site points = 25 plus 1 point for each additional
                             1,000 square feet of building area
 More than 5,000 square feet Parking lot points = 2 points per required parking
                             space and 1 point for each proposed additional
                             parking space beyond required spaces
 
      3.   When only a portion of a larger tract is developed then only the
developed area shall be considered when determining the number of points
required. All required landscaping shall be placed within the developed area.
      4.   Sixty percent (60%) of the total landscaping shall be within the
front and side yards.
      5.   One hundred percent (100%) of the parking lot points must be located
within five feet (5') of the paved area associated with parking and
maneuvering.
      6.   Forty percent (40%) of the landscaping requirement attributable to
the parking area (parking lot points) shall be located within parking lot
islands. For the purposes of this requirement, a parking lot island is any
landscaped space greater than or equal to five feet (5') in width that is
located or extends into a paved parking area for approximately the length of
one or more spaces.
      7.   A maximum of twenty five percent (25%) of the required points may be
used for turf grass, river rock or other ground cover, and a maximum of fifty
percent (50%) of the ground cover in any yard area may be non-live materials.
      8.   A minimum of twenty five percent (25%) of the required points shall
be used for evergreen plantings.
      9.   Only ten percent (10%) of the landscaping requirement may be used
within designated detention basins. Any additional landscaping provided within
these detention basins shall not be assigned any landscape points for
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      10.   Developments providing additional landscaping such that the total
number of landscaping points provided is at least twenty percent (20%) more
than the total required landscaping points, may reduce the total required
number of parking spaces for said development by a maximum of ten percent
(10%). This provision shall not apply to developments requiring less than ten
(10) parking spaces.
      11.   The developer may use any combination of plantings to obtain the
necessary number of points for the development. Different lots and landscapes
will lend themselves to different types of plantings. The regulations attempt
to encourage creativity and diversity in landscaping. Different types of
plantings shall be worth point values as shown in table 1, "Landscape Point
Values", of this section.
      12.   Landscaping placed in a public right-of-way or easement shall be
limited to turf and/or other groundcover, unless otherwise approved by the
Director of the Department of Community Development. All such landscaping shall
be irrigated and maintained by the developer and may be counted towards
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      13.   All existing trees and other landscaping for which credit is
requested must be in good health and located within the developed area. Any
such credits are subject to approval by the Director of the Department of
Community Development and will be awarded based on the type, size and condition
of the existing trees and other landscaping in accordance with table 1,
"Landscape Point Values", of this section.

12-1105: EXPANSION OF EXISTING NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   All developments which are in existence prior to the effective date of
this chapter may continue as legal nonconforming development until such time as
a building permit is issued to expand the structure and/or parking area.
   B.   Any application for a building permit for an expansion of a structure
or parking lot within a legal nonconforming development shall require the
development to be brought into compliance with this chapter on a graduated
scale based upon the ratio of the area of the building expansion to the area of
the existing structures. Said ratio shall be applied to the total amount of
site and parking lot landscaping points required for development. The required
landscaping shall be placed throughout the development as indicated herein.
   C.   When not all structures within a legal nonconforming development are
being expanded, the number of landscaping points required may be determined
either from the ratio of the area of expansion to the area of the affected
building or the ratio of the area of expansion to the total area of all the
buildings within the development. The ratio used would be applied to the
landscaping points required for the expanded building or entire development as
appropriate. The required landscaping would be placed around the affected
building and associated parking or throughout the entire development depending
on which method is used.
   D.   In addition to the allowable methods of irrigation as listed in this
chapter, a hose attachment located within one hundred feet (100') of all
required landscape area and plant materials shall be allowed as an acceptable
method of provided irrigation for landscaping installed with expanded legal
nonconforming developments.
   E.   For the construction or expansion of parking area not associated with a
new or expanded building, the total site and parking lot points would be
determined based on the developed area and number of parking spaces as provided
herein, with the required landscaping being placed within and around the new or
expanded parking area, or distributed throughout the development associated
with said parking area, provided that such distribution is in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1767, 6-27-2017)
12-1106: SELECTION OF LANDSCAPE MATERIAL:
   A.   When selecting plant materials to be used for compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, attention should be given to the suitability of the
material for use in southwestern Oklahoma, specifically the exposure, soil
requirements, hardiness, and drought tolerance. The developer is strongly
encouraged to consider selecting plant materials from Oklahoma Proven as
published by the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at
Oklahoma State University or the City of Duncan planting materials list.
   B.   Only trees selected from Oklahoma Proven as published by the Department
of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Oklahoma State University, or the
City of Duncan planting materials list may be credited towards compliance with
the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Certain trees due to their susceptibility to disease, decay, insects
and/or their production of seeds, fruits, sap or other objectionable material
are considered nuisances and are prohibited from being included on any
landscaping plan submitted under this chapter. Such trees shall be identified
within the City of Duncan planting materials list.
   D.   Trees not listed in the City of Duncan planting materials list as
either recommended or prohibited, may be included within the project
landscaping, but shall not be awarded landscaping points. (Ord. 1767, 6-27-

for an unobstructed view at sight triangles and driveways.
   B.   All planting beds within new construction shall be a minimum of five
feet (5'). Planting areas within existing parking areas shall be a minimum of
three feet (3'). Within narrower areas only turf or other ground cover may be
used towards compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   All planting beds should include mulch and edging. Tree locations shall
include mulch.
   D.   The use of artificial grass or any form of synthetic material does not
meet the definition of landscaping as required herein. Such materials may be
used in conjunction with other approved materials, but shall not be assigned
any landscape points for compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   E.   Special features may be assigned points by the Director of the
Department of Community Development in accordance with section
12-1104, table 1, "Landscape Point Values", of this chapter for features such
as fountains, ponds, statues, sculptures, and benches when used in conjunction
with approved materials and are considered as an enhancement to the project
site.
   F.   Landscaping points that may be assigned to non-live plant materials and
features is limited to fifty percent (50%) of the total required points.
Additional non-live plant materials and features shall not be assigned any
landscape points for compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   G.   The developer shall be required to install an irrigation system to all
required landscape areas to insure that sufficient water is delivered to plant
materials utilizing one or more of the following methods:
      1.   An automatic or manual underground irrigation system (such as a
conventional spray, bubbler, etc.) that is equipped with a rain and freeze
sensor (for points awarded).
      2.   An automatic water-saving irrigation system (such as drip, porous
pipe, leaky pipes, etc.) that is equipped with a rain and freeze sensor (for
points awarded).
      3.   Required landscape areas, including areas utilizing extreme drought
tolerant "xeriscape" plant materials may be irrigated with a hose attachment
located within one hundred feet (100') of all required plant materials (no
points awarded). (Ord. 1767, 6-27-2017)
12-1108: MAINTENANCE OF LANDSCAPING:
   A.   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in
good condition all the improvements required by this chapter. Any required
landscaping components shall be maintained and repaired if those components
become damaged. Any vegetation that dies shall be replaced no later than the
following planting season (spring or fall).
   B.   All development and property subject to the provisions of this chapter
shall be maintained by regular weeding, irrigation, fertilizing, mowing, and
pruning of plant materials in conformance with good horticultural practices.
   C.   All landscaping materials not properly maintained such that they become
overgrown, exhibit evidence of weed and/or pest infestation, or fall into
disrepair will be considered a public nuisance under the provisions of this
Code and abated under the provisions therein.
   D.   All required plant materials which are removed or perish for any
reason, must be replaced with similar materials of greater than or equal point
value as the removed/perished materials as they were credited at the time of
planting.
   E.   If Stage 3 water restrictions are invoked by the City of Duncan per
section
17-220 of this Code, enforcement of the provisions of section
17-220 of this Code will be suspended during said restriction and for one
hundred twenty (120) days thereafter.

14-602: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare by controlling the number, location and design of driveways and
appurtenant improvements in order to:
   A.   Minimize conflicts between traffic on public streets and traffic
entering and exiting private property;

   E.   Supplement the provisions and requirements of the major street plan for
the city. (Ord. 1263, 1-13-1987)
14-603: PERMIT REQUIRED:
   A.   It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person,
firm, corporation, partnership or association to remove, alter, erect or
construct any curb, gutter, approach, driveway or drainage facility upon or
within a public street right of way without first obtaining a permit therefor
from the director of public works or his/her designated representative.
   B.   Application for a permit, as herein required, shall be made on the form
specified by the director of public works and shall be accompanied by such plot
plan or survey as may be required to assure compliance with this chapter. At a
minimum, such plan or survey shall accurately indicate existing and proposed
buildings, driveways, utilities, parking arrangements, property lines and
adjacent street improvements.
   C.   The application for a driveway permit shall be accompanied by a permit
fee as shall be set by motion of the city council. Such fee shall be

family, commercial or industrial facilities prior to issuance of a building
permit; and
      2.   The public works director shall be notified of issuance of all
building permits involving driveway improvements. (Ord. 1263, 1-13-1987)
14-604: CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION OR OCCUPANCY:
No building, construction or site improvement issued a driveway permit or
building permit shall be considered satisfactorily completed until driveway
construction or modification therein required has been completed, and no
certificate of occupancy or completion shall be issued therefor without the
approval of the public works director, or his/her designated representative.
(Ord. 1263, 1-13-1987)
14-605: RIGHT OF ACCESS:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as denying reasonable access to a
public street from an adjacent property unless such street is a limited access
roadway. In such instance where the size, shape or topography of a tract of
land makes compliance with the provisions of this chapter impractical or
imposes an undue hardship, the owner or tenant thereof may appeal the strict
application of this chapter to the public works director. (Ord. 1263, 1-13-
1987)
14-606: APPEALS:
   A.   Any person appealing the strict application of these standards shall
submit to the public works director a written appeal specifying:
      1.   The portion or portions of provisions of this chapter being
appealed;
      2.   The conditions unique to the property which make the application of
such provisions impractical and unreasonable; and
      3.   Plans showing the applicant's proposed alternative.
   B.   Upon receipt of an application on appeal, the public works director
shall, within five (5) working days, make a determination as to the merits of
the appeal. Such determination shall be made in writing and shall consider:
      1.   Validity of the hardship claimed, as compared to an inconvenience;
      2.   Ability of the site to provide access without the relief requested;
and
      3.   Uniqueness of the size, shape or topographic conditions claimed to
create an undue hardship.
   C.   Upon a finding that an appeal is reasonable and necessary, the public
works director may issue a driveway permit granting such relief as necessary to
allow suitable access to the site and bearing such conditions as necessary to
meet the spirit and intent of this chapter.
   D.   Upon a finding that an appeal is not reasonable or necessary, the
public works director shall so inform the applicant in writing, accompanied by
the findings.
   E.   Upon receipt of the public works director's findings, an applicant may
request a hearing of his appeal before the board of adjustment. Such hearing
shall be held only after notice of hearing as required for a zoning variance.
At such hearing, the applicant, interested parties and public works director
shall be heard.
   F.   In considering an appeal, the board of adjustment shall be required to
make the same findings required for a zoning variance in order to grant the
appeal. The board may approve the requested driveways, modify the requested
driveways or deny the request.
   G.   Appeal from the board of adjustment's action may be taken to district
court as provided in the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 1263, 1-13-1987)
14-607: PENALTY FOR VIOLATION:
Violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be considered an offense
against the city, punishable, upon conviction, in accordance with section

14-608: DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS:
   A.   Standard Driveway Dimensions:
      1.   For purposes of this chapter, allowable driveway dimensions shall
vary with the type of land use they serve as classified under the zoning
ordinance, and as follows:
         a.   Residential driveways serve one- and two-family dwelling sites.
         b.   Multi-family driveways serve three (3) or more dwellings and uses
permitted on review in a residential district and churches.
         c.   Commercial driveways serve uses permitted by right and upon
review in any commercial zoning district.
         d.   Industrial driveways serve uses allowed only in industrial zoning
districts.
      2.   Allowable driveway dimensions are hereby established as contained in
table 1, "Standard Driveway Dimensions", of this section.
The requirements of the table of standard driveway dimensions and the terms
used therein are illustrated in section
14-610, figures 1 through 5 of this chapter.
   B.   Limitations On Number And Total Driveway Opening:
      1.   In order to restrict the number of points of conflict between
traffic upon a public street and traffic entering and exiting private property,
the number and total width of driveways shall be limited in proportion to the
street frontage of the property served, in accordance with table 2,
"Limitations On Number And Total Driveway Opening", of this section.
      2.   The limitations on driveways shall be applied to individual tracts
of record under the same ownership as shown in the office of the county clerk
for Stephens County.
      3.   Calculation of allowable driveways and widths shall be based on a
single street frontage. Properties with frontage on two (2) or more streets

   Note:
      1.    Individual drives shall not exceed width allowed in table 1,
"Standard Driveway Dimension", of this section.
   C.   Driveways On Or Adjacent To Major Streets And Section Line Roads:
      1.   Except as provided in subsection C2 of this section, no portion of a
driveway upon a major street or section line road shall be located closer to
the right of way of an intersecting major street or section line road than a
distance equal to one-half (1/2) of the frontage upon which the driveway is
located or fifty feet (50'), whichever provides the greater setback; provided,
that a setback of over one hundred fifty feet (150') shall not be required.
      2.   Driveways located upon properties at the intersection of two (2)
major streets shall not be required to meet the provisions of subsection C1 of
this section, when entering upon a divided roadway with a median which
prohibits exiting vehicles from making left hand turns.
      3.   Residential lots with primary frontage upon a local street shall not
be permitted secondary driveway access from a major street or section line road
from the rear yard or side yard of such lots.
   D.   Angle Of Intersection With Street:
      1.   Driveways should intersect with the public street at right angles
whenever feasible. In no instance shall the angle of intersection be less than
seventy five degrees (75°).
      2.   The angle of intersection shall be measured upon a line from the
center points of the driveway at the edge of the street and at the right of way
line.
      3.   On curvilinear streets or cul-de-sacs, the angle of intersection
shall be measured from the tangent of the street radius.
   E.   Alternative Design Options:
      1.   Insufficient Right Of Way For Radius: When a full radius cannot be
achieved due to insufficient separation between the right of way and back of
curb or street edge, the radius may be either:
         a.   Terminated at the right of way; or
         b.   Extended beyond the right of way.
      2.   Compound Radius Returns: When desired, a compound radius may be laid
upon the right of way in order to allow easier access to paved areas
immediately behind the right of way line; provided, that the minimum radius is
maintained to within five feet (5') of the right of way.
      3.   Existing Conditions And Driveways: It is the intent of this chapter
to require modification of existing driveways as a condition for approval of
building permits for the remodeling or expansion on commercial and industrial
properties. In instances where full compliance with these standards is
impractical, the public works director may require alternative improvements in
order to control turning movements and restrict the number and width of
driveways. These alternative improvements may include, but shall not be limited
to:
         a.   Reduction of existing driveway openings;
         b.   Installation of radius/returns;
         c.   Installation of barrier islands adjacent to the edge of street;
         d.   Modification of parking arrangement or striping in order to
restrict backing onto a public street.
   F.   Interpretation Of Design Terms: Words and terms used in this chapter
shall be interpreted as follows:
    DRIVEWAY: Any facility, pavement or construction intended or used for
vehicular ingress and egress from a street to private property, within the
limits of the right of way as herein defined.
   DRIVEWAY WIDTH (W): The width of a driveway at the right of way measured
parallel to the right of way, or the narrowest dimension of the driveway
measured perpendicular to the centerline if drive is not at a ninety degree
(90°) angle to the street.

work bridges, hand floats, ten foot (10') straight edge and small tools to
satisfactorily complete the work.
      5.   Cleanup: All chunks of concrete, excess dirt, forms, etc., must be
hauled off and all sidewalks, curbs, and drive approaches are to be backfilled
before final inspection is made.
      6.   Dirt Work: All rough grading shall be done before curb removal.
Existing soil shall be removed a minimum of six inches (6") deep and a maximum
of eight inches (8") unless soft ground is encountered, then all soft material
shall be removed and brought back to grade with river sand.
      7.   Contraction Joints: Contraction joints shall be sawed one- third (1/
3) the thickness of the concrete and placed as shown on the "standard details
for driveways". Contraction joints shall be cut as soon as concrete has
hardened sufficiently to permit sawing without excessive ravelling and before
uncontrolled cracking occurs. All sawed joints exposed to traffic shall be
filled with approved joint sealer.
   D.   Drainage Provisions:
      1.   Curb And Gutter Streets:
         a.   Driveways on curb and gutter section streets shall rise six
inches (6") from the gutter elevation at a point six feet (6') from the back of
the original curb line. From that point, the grade of the driveway may rise or
fall.
         b.   Surface drainage may be carried across the driveway to the
gutter, provided alternative drainage improvements are not required in
conjunction with a building permit or development approval.

   D.   The exemption in subsection B3 of this section shall be granted to a
law enforcement officer operating an authorized emergency vehicle for law
enforcement purposes without using audible and visual signals required by this
section as long as the action does not endanger life or property if the officer
is following a suspected violator of the law with probable cause to believe
that:
      1.   Knowledge of the presence of the officer will cause the suspect to:
         a.   Destroy or lose evidence of a suspected felony;
         b.   End a suspected continuing felony before the officer has obtained
sufficient evidence to establish grounds for arrest; or
         c.   Evade apprehension or identification of the suspect or the

consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others. (Prior code
ch. 20; amd. 2015 Code)
15-216: OPERATION OF VEHICLES ON APPROACH OF AUTHORIZED EMERGENCY VEHICLES 1 :
   A.   Upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle making
use of audible and visual signals meeting the requirements of the laws of this

passed, except when otherwise directed by a police officer.
   B.   This section shall not operate to relieve the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all
persons using the highway. (Prior code ch. 20)

turn from or into a roadway. Vehicles turning left from the roadway shall not
be driven in the two-way left turn lane for more than two hundred feet (200')
while preparing for and making the turn. A vehicle turning left onto the
roadway may utilize the two-way left turn lane as a staging area by stopping
and waiting for traffic proceeding in the same direction to clear before
merging into the adjacent lanes of travel. A left turn shall not be made from
any other lane where a two-way left turn lane has been designated. Provided,
however, this section shall not prohibit driving across a two-way left turn
lane when moving from a service drive onto such marked roadway.
   E.   Official signs may be erected directing slow moving traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway. Drivers of
vehicles shall obey the directions of every such sign.
   F.   Whenever any highway has been divided into two (2) or more roadways by
leaving an intervening space or by a physical barrier or clearly indicated
dividing section so constructed as to impede vehicular traffic, every vehicle
shall be driven only upon the right hand roadway unless directed or permitted
to use another roadway by official traffic control devices or police officers.
No vehicle shall be driven over, across or within any such dividing space,
barrier, median or section, except through an opening in such physical barrier
or dividing section or space or at a crossover or intersection as established
by the city. (Prior code ch. 20; amd. 2015 Code)

portion of the roadway. (Prior code ch. 20)
15-504: PASSING VEHICLE PROCEEDING IN SAME DIRECTION 1 :
   A.   Except as provided in section
15-503 of this chapter, the driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe
distance, and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until
safely clear of the overtaken vehicle. No vehicle shall be driven to the left
side of the center of the roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction, unless such left side is clearly visible and
is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such
overtaking and passing to be completely made without interfering with the safe
operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle
overtaken. In every event, the overtaking vehicle must return to the right hand
side of the roadway before coming within one hundred feet (100') of any vehicle
approaching from the opposite direction.
   B.   Every driver who intends to pass another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, which requires movement of his vehicle from one lane of traffic to
another, shall first see that such movement can be made with safety and shall
proceed to pass only after giving a proper signal by hand or mechanical device.
   C.   Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the
driver of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the
overtaking vehicle on audible signal and shall not increase the speed of his
vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle. (Prior code ch. 20)

15-526: EVIDENCE OF INTOXICATION OR IMPAIRED ABILITY IN PROSECUTION OF DUI 1 :
   A.   Upon the prosecution of any person for a violation of sections
15-524 and
15-525 of this chapter, evidence of the amount of alcohol in such person's
blood, as shown by a chemical analysis of his blood or breath, is admissible.
   B.   Upon the trial of any criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts
alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any
other intoxicating substance, or the combined influence of alcohol and any
other intoxicating substance, evidence of the alcohol concentration in the
blood or breath of the person as shown by analysis of the blood or breath of
the person performed in accordance with the provisions of 47 Oklahoma Statutes
sections 752 and 759 or evidence of the presence and concentration of any other
intoxicating substance as shown by analysis of such person's blood, breath,
saliva, or urine specimens in accordance with the provisions of 47 Oklahoma
Statutes sections 752 and 759 is admissible. Evidence that the person has
refused to submit to either of said analyses is also admissible. For the
purpose of this section, when the person is under the age of twenty one (21)
years, evidence that there was, at the time of the test, any measurable
quantity of alcohol is prima facie evidence that the person is under the
influence of alcohol in violation of 47 Oklahoma Statutes section
11-906.4. For persons twenty one (21) years of age or older:
      1.   Evidence that there was, at the time of the test, an alcohol
concentration of five-hundredths (0.05) or less is prima facie evidence that
the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
      2.   Evidence that there was, at the time of the test, an alcohol
concentration in excess of five-hundredths (0.05) but less than eight-
hundredths (0.08) is relevant evidence that the person's ability to operate a
motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. However, no person shall be convicted of
the offense of operating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle
while such person's ability to operate such vehicle was impaired by alcohol
solely because there was, at the time of the test, an alcohol concentration in
excess of five-hundredths (0.05) but less than eight-hundredths (0.08) in the
blood or breath of the person in the absence of additional evidence that such
person's ability to operate such vehicle was affected by alcohol to the extent
that the public health and safety was threatened or that said person had
violated a state statute or local ordinance in the operation of a motor
vehicle; and
      3.   Evidence that there was, at the time of the test, an alcohol
concentration of eight-hundredths (0.08) or more shall be admitted as prima
facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
   C.   For purposes of this title "alcohol concentration" means grams of
alcohol per one hundred milliliters (100 ml) of blood if the blood was tested,
or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters (210 l) of breath if the breath
was tested.
   D.   To be admissible in a proceeding, the evidence must first be qualified
by establishing that the test was administered to the person within two (2)
hours after the arrest of the person. (Ord. 1607, 9-13-2005)

   B.   No person shall for the purpose of facilitating or aiding or as an
incident to any unlawful motor vehicle speed contest upon any street or
highway, in any manner obstruct or place any barricade or obstruction upon any
street or highway.
   C.   When three (3) or more persons assemble to witness or participate in an

participates in such unlawful assembly is guilty of an offense. (Ord. 1566, 5-
27-2003)

vehicles approaching the intersection at such a distance as not to constitute
immediate hazard from the duty to drive with due care to avoid a collision. The
driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign if required for safety to stop
shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection
before entering the intersection; if there is no crosswalk, the driver shall
stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if there is no stop line, then at the

15-604: WHEN OFFICIAL TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES REQUIRED FOR ENFORCEMENT
PURPOSES:
No provision of this chapter for which official traffic control devices are
required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place
of the alleged violation an official device is not in proper position and
sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. If a
particular section does not state that official traffic control devices are
required, such section shall be effective even though no devices are erected or
in place. (Prior code ch. 20)
15-605: TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND 1 :
   A.   The display of signal lights, arrows and words shall be deemed to have
the following meanings and requires the appropriate response on the part of
vehicular traffic and pedestrians:
      1.   Green alone, "go":
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such
place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within
the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green
shall have the right of way over such vehicular traffic; and
         b.   Pedestrian traffic, facing a green signal may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a "walk" signal
indicator is operating;
      2.   Steady yellow or amber alone, "caution":
         a.   The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute
a warning that the "red" or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter; and
         b.   Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near
side crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so
near the limit line when the "caution" signal first flashes that a stop cannot
be made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the
intersection and clear the same before the "red" signal flashes;
      3.   Red alone, "stop":
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or "go" is shown alone.
Except where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the
right traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the
intersection cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield
the right of way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and
the turn shall be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic
proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street; and
         b.   Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the
roadway when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal
indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or
"go" is shown alone unless authorized to do so, by a pedestrian "walk" signal;
      4.   Steady red with green arrow:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic
lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated
by the arrow, but shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement
indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only
on the red with green arrow signal; and
         b.   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless
he can do so safely and without interfering with vehicular traffic;
      5.   Green arrows alone: Whenever vehicular traffic movements are
controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal
indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by
the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are
displayed.
   B.   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which, by their
nature, can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
(Prior code ch. 20)

in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles; and
   B.   "Wait" or "don't walk": No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his crossing on the "walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone
while the "wait" signal is showing. (Prior code ch. 20)
15-607: FLASHING SIGNALS 1 :
   A.   Whenever an illuminated signal is flashing red or yellow, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
      1.   Flashing red: When a red light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject
to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign; and
      2.   Flashing yellow: When a yellow light is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection,
or pass such signal only with caution.
   B.   This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. (Prior code

highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to be
or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic control device or
railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic,
or which hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official
traffic control device or any railroad sign or signal.
   B.   No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit
upon any highway any traffic sign, signal, or device bearing thereon any
commercial advertising.

      2.   The authorized agents of the authority may disconnect or discontinue
any or all utility services to the customer after mailing or posting written

discontinue to furnish water, electricity and/or other utility services to any
customer refusing or neglecting to pay all or any part of a utility bill
submitted after providing written or oral notice to the customer of the intent
of the authority to discontinue the water, electrical, and/or other utility
service. (Ord. 1637, 9-12-2006)

past and has had service suspended for nonpayment or has a past due account
balance on a closed account. Existing customer deposits will be increased if
any of the following conditions occur: return of a check or draft item, service
order is issued for disconnect due to nonpayment or unauthorized use of service
without proper authorization from the authority.

      6.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the wastewater treatment system.
   B.   In meeting these objectives, this chapter provides that all persons in
the service area of the city must have adequate wastewater treatment either in
the form of a connection to the municipal wastewater treatment system or, where
the system is not available, an appropriate private disposal system. This
chapter also provides for the issuance of permits to system users, for the
regulations of wastewater discharge volume and characteristics, for monitoring
and enforcement activities; and for the setting of fees for the full and
equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation, maintenance, and
capital recovery of the wastewater treatment system and from other activities
required by the enforcement and administrative program established herein.
   C.   This chapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city,
who are by contract or agreement with the city, users of the municipal

1993)
ARTICLE B.  DISCHARGE AND DISCHARGE PERMITS
17-310: APPLICATION FOR DISCHARGE OF WASTEWATER:
   A.   All users or prospective users that generate nondomestic wastewater
shall make application to the superintendent for written authorization to
discharge to the municipal wastewater treatment system. The application shall
be in a form and require such information about the user as the superintendent
may prescribe. Applications shall be required from all new dischargers as well
as for any existing discharger desiring additional service. Connection to the
municipal sewer shall not be made until the application is received and
approved by the superintendent and the building sewer is installed in
accordance with section
17-304 of this chapter and an inspection has been performed by the proper city
official.
   B.   The receipt by the city of a prospective customer's application for
service shall not obligate the city to render the service. If the service
applied for cannot be supplied in accordance with this chapter and the city's
rules and regulations and general practice, the application shall be rejected,
and there shall be no liability of the city to the applicant for such service,
except that conditional waivers for additional services may be granted by the
superintendent for interim periods if compliance may be assured within a
reasonable period of time. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-311: DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS:
   A.   All users or prospective users which generate nondomestic wastewater
shall, when making application for discharge pursuant to section
17-310 of this chapter, provide the following information: name (owners and
operators), address, and location (if different from the mailing address); the
standard industrial classification (SIC) of the operation(s) carried out by the
applicant; wastewater volume; wastewater constituents and characteristics;
discharge variations; a description of all toxic materials handled on the
premises; and any other information deemed necessary by the superintendent,
including, but not limited to, site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing
plans and details of existing and proposed pretreatment or equalization
facilities.
   B.   If the superintendent determines that the applicant constitutes a
significant industrial user, then the conditions of section
17-312 of this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-312: INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS:
   A.   Permit Required: All significant industrial users proposing to connect
to or to contribute to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit
before connecting to or contributing to the POTW. All existing significant
industrial users shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within sixty
(60) days after the effective date of this chapter and shall be required to
qualify for granting of the wastewater discharge permit within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the effective date of this chapter. Proposed new users
shall apply at least ninety (90) days prior to connecting to or contributing to
the POTW.
   B.   Additional Information Required For Permit: The following additional
information shall constitute a baseline report and shall be required to obtain
a wastewater discharge permit:
      1.   A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility;
      2.   A brief description of the nature and average rate of production of
the facility. This description should include a schematic process diagram which
indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes;
      3.   The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily
flow and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each
regulated process stream and other streams as necessary to allow use of the
combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). The city may allow for
verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility
considerations;
      4.   The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process;
      5.   The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the city
or pretreatment standard) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration or mass, where
required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations; (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
      6.   A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics, if the parameter
is required, for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist;
for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control
authority may authorize a lower minimum. For all other pollutants, twenty four
(24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional
composite sampling techniques unless time proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the
samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that
facility or facilities;
      7.   Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and
grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for
other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as
appropriate; (Ord. 1700, 9-13-2011)
      8.   Samples for categorical industries should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream
from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are
mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined
waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with
the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has
been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be submitted to the city. Samples for noncategorical
industries will be taken of the total facility discharge just prior to
connection with the POTW;
      9.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR
part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
administrator;
      10.   The city may allow the submission of a report which utilizes only
historical data so long as the data is sufficient to determine the need for
industrial pretreatment measures;
      11.   The report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling,
and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW;
      12.   This report will contain a certification statement contained in
subsection
17-329I of this chapter, signed by an authorized representative of the
"industrial user" (as defined in section
17-302 of this chapter) and certified to by a qualified professional,
indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis,
and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) or additional
pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements;
      13.   Any user who elects or is required to construct new or additional
facilities for pretreatment shall as a part of the application for wastewater
discharge permit submit plans, specifications and other pertinent information
relative to the proposed construction to the superintendent for approval. Plans
and specifications submitted for approval must bear the seal of a professional
engineer registered to practice engineering in the state. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be issued until such plans and specifications are
approved. Approval of such plans and specifications shall in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter;
      14.   If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the application shall include the
shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. For the purpose of
this subsection, "pretreatment standards" shall include either a national
pretreatment standard, or a pretreatment standard imposed by this chapter. The
following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         a.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for
major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.);
         b.   No increment referred to in subsection B14a of this section shall
exceed nine (9) months; and
         c.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress
report to the superintendent including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason
for the delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction
to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse
between such progress reports to the superintendent;
      15.   Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has
been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined waste stream
formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), or fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR
403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by subsection A of
this section, the information required by subsections B12 and B14 of this
section shall pertain to the modified limits;
      16.   If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal
allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)),
or fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the user
submits the report required by subsection A of this section, any necessary
amendments to the information requested by subsections B12 and B14 of this
section shall be submitted by the user to the city within sixty (60) days after
the modified limit is approved;
      17.   The city will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may
require additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data
furnished, the city may issue a wastewater discharge permit subject to terms
and conditions provided herein; and
      18.   The superintendent will act only on applications containing all the
information required in this article. Persons who have filed incomplete
applications will be notified by the superintendent that the application is
deficient and the nature of such deficiency and will be given thirty (30) days
to correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within such
extended period as allowed by the superintendent, the superintendent shall
submit the application to the city engineer with a recommendation that it be
denied and notify the applicant in writing of such action. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-
1993)
   C.   Permit Conditions: Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this chapter and all other applicable regulations,
user charges and fees established by the city. Permits must contain the
following:
      1.   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the

compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 1700, 9-13-2011)
   D.   Permit Modifications: Within nine (9) months of the promulgation of a
national categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater discharge permit of
users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with
such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user
subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard has not previously
submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as required by
subsection B of this section, the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge
permit within one hundred eighty (180) days after the promulgation of the
applicable national pretreatment standard. A user with an existing wastewater
discharge permit shall submit to the superintendent within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the promulgation of an applicable federal categorical
pretreatment standard the information required by subsections B2 and B3 of this
section. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification
by the superintendent during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be
informed of any proposed changes in this permit at least thirty (30) days prior
to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   E.   Permit Duration: Permits shall be issued for a specified time period,
not to exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a
year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for
permit reissuance a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing permit.
   F.   Permit Transfer: Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be
reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises,
or new or changed operation without the prior approval of the city. Any
succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the
existing permit.
   G.   Revocation Of Permit: Any permit issued under the provisions of this
chapter is subject to be modified, suspended, or revoked in whole or in part
during its term for cause including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit or other applicable federal, state, or local regulation;
      2.   Obtaining a permit by misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully
all relevant facts;
      3.   A change in any condition that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge;
      4.   Failure of a user to accurately report the discharge constituents
and characteristics or to report significant changes in plant operations or
wastewater characteristics; or
      5.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring.
   H.   Revocation Procedure: Should conditions arise requiring permit
revocation the procedure outlined in this chapter will be followed. (Ord. 1335,
6-22-1993)
17-313: GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   General Prohibitions: A user may not introduce into the POTW any
pollutant(s) which cause pass-through or interference. These general
prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in subsection C of this section
apply to each user introducing pollutants into the POTW whether or not the user
is subject to national pretreatment standards or any national, state, or local
pretreatment requirements.
   B.   Affirmative Defense: A user shall have an affirmative defense in any
action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions
established in subsection A of this section and the specific prohibitions in
subsections C3 through C7 of this section where the user can demonstrate that:
      1.   It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources would cause
pass-through or interference; and
      2.   a. A local limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference,
as the case may be, was developed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c) for each
pollutant in the user's discharge that caused pass-through or interference, and
the user was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and
during the pass-through or interference; or
         b.   If a local limit designed to prevent pass-through or
interference, as the case may be, has not been developed in accordance with 40
CFR 403.5(c) for the pollutants that caused the pass-through or interference,
the user's discharge directly prior to and during the pass-through or
interference did not change substantially in nature and constituents from the
user's prior discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with
the POTW's NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference,
applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal.
   C.   Specific Prohibitions: In addition, the following pollutants shall not
be introduced into the POTW:
      1.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140°F) or sixty degrees
centigrade (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
      2.   Pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW,
but in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.0, or greater than or equal to
12.5 standard units, unless the works is specifically designed to accommodate
such discharges;
      3.   Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction
to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, such as, but not limited to,

public nuisance;
      11.   Any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface
drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters
unless specific approval is obtained from the superintendent. Stormwater and
all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are
specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the
superintendent and the state department of public health. Industrial cooling
waters or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval of the
superintendent and the state department of public health, to a storm sewer or
natural outlet;
      12.   The use of enzymes, hot water, emulsifiers or other agents to cause
oil or grease to pass through the user's grease trap or treatment unit designed
to remove oil or grease;
      13.   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any
way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific
limitation developed by the city or state. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-314: RESTRICTIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH:
No person or user shall discharge wastewater that exceeds the following set of
standards (table A, "Local Discharge Restrictions", of this section). These
restrictions apply to wastewater discharges to the main wastewater treatment
facility and to the industrial park lagoons. Sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and
amendments thereto. Dilution of any wastewater discharge for the purpose of
satisfying these requirements shall be considered in violation of this chapter.

(Ord. 1700, 9-13-2011)
17-315: PROTECTION OF TREATMENT PLANT INFLUENT:
The superintendent shall monitor the treatment works influent for each
parameter in the above table. Industrial users shall be subject to reporting
and monitoring requirements regarding these parameters as set forth in this
chapter. In the event that the influent at the POTW reaches or exceeds
established levels, the superintendent shall initiate technical studies to
determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend to the city
the necessary remedial measures, including, but not limited to, recommending
the establishment of new or revised pretreatment levels for these parameters.
The superintendent shall also recommend changes to any of these criteria in the
event that the POTW effluent standards are changed, there are changes in any
applicable law or regulation affecting same, or changes are needed for more
effective operation of the POTW. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-316: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a
particular industrial subcategory, the federal standards, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The
superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR section 403.12. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-317: RIGHT TO ESTABLISH MORE RESTRICTIVE CRITERIA:
No statement in this chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the
superintendent from establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria more
restrictive where wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the
facilities of the POTW or to create a public nuisance or to cause the discharge
of the POTW to violate effluent or stream water quality standards, or to
interfere with the use or handling of sludge, or to pass through the POTW
resulting in a violation of the NPDES permit, or to exceed industrial
pretreatment standards for discharge to municipal wastewater treatment systems
as imposed by the state department of public health or the United States
environmental protection agency. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-318: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
Nothing in this article shall be construed so as to prevent any special
agreement or arrangement between the city and any user of the wastewater
treatment system whereby wastewater of unusual strength is accepted into the
system and specially treated subject to any payments or user charges as may be
applicable. The making of such special agreements or arrangements between the
city and the user shall be strictly limited by applicable federal and local
discharge limitations and to the capability of the POTW to handle such wastes
without interfering with the unit operations or sludge use and handling or
allowing the pass- through of pollutants which would result in a violation of
the NPDES permit. No special agreement or arrangement may be made without
documentation by the industry of the use of good management practice in the
reduction of wastewater volume and strength. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-319: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
   A.   Operation And Maintenance: The industrial user shall at all times
properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and
control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the
industrial user to achieve compliance with the conditions of this chapter.
Proper operation and maintenance includes, but is not limited to: effective
performance, adequate funding, adequate operator staffing and training, and
adequate laboratory and process controls, including appropriate quality
assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of backup or
auxiliary or similar system only when necessary to achieve compliance with the
conditions of this chapter.
   B.   Reduction, Loss Or Failure: Upon reduction, loss or failure of the
pretreatment facility, the industrial user shall, to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with its permit, control production or all discharges or
both until the operation of the treatment facility is restored or an alternate
method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies, for example, when
the primary source of power of the treatment facility fails or is reduced. It
shall not be a defense for the permittee in an enforcement action that it would
have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to
maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.
   C.   Bypass Of Treatment Facilities:
      1.   An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the reporting requirements of this article;
      2.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the city, if possible at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass;
      3.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the city within twenty
four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.
A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time
the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive
the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty four (24) hours;
      4.   Bypass is prohibited unless:
         a.   It was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage;
         b.   There was no feasible alternative, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The industrial user submitted the notices as required by
subsections C2 and C3 of this section;
      5.   The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection C4 of this section. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-320: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE:
   A.   Protection From Accidental Discharge: All industrial users shall
provide such facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent or minimize the potential for accidental discharge into
the POTW of waste regulated by this chapter from liquid or raw material storage
areas, from truck and railcar loading and unloading areas, from in plant
transfer or processing and materials handling areas, and from diked areas or
holding ponds of any waste regulated by this chapter. The wastewater discharge
permit of any user who has a history of significant leaks, spills or other
accidental discharge of waste regulated by this chapter shall be subject on a
case by case basis to a special permit condition or the requirement for the
construction of facilities and establishment of procedures which will prevent
or minimize the potential for such accidental discharge. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent before the facility is
constructed. The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
      1.   At least once every two (2) years all significant industrial users
will be evaluated to determine if there is a need for plan to control slug
discharges. If such plan is required it will contain, at a minimum, the
following elements:
         a.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
         b.   Description of stored chemicals;
         c.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a discharge a prohibition under 40
CFR 403.5(b) with procedures for follow up written notification within five (5)
days; and
         d.   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control
of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including
solvents), or measures and equipment for emergency response.
   B.   Notification Of Accidental Discharge: Any person causing or suffering
from any accidental discharge shall immediately notify the POTW treatment plant
by telephone to enable countermeasures to be taken by the superintendent to
minimize damage to the POTW, the health and welfare of the public, and the
environment. This notification shall be followed, within five (5) days of the
date of the occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of
the accidental discharge and measures being taken to prevent future occurrence.
Such notification will not relieve the user of liability for any expense, loss,
or damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property;
nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or state or federal law.
   C.   Notice To Employees: Employers shall ensure that all employees who may
cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
ARTICLE C.  INDUSTRIAL USER MONITORING
17-325: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   The installation of a monitoring facility shall be required for all
industrial users having wastes which receive pretreatment, or otherwise altered
or regulated before discharge, or are unusually strong and thereby subject to a
surcharge. The monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other suitable
facility approved by the superintendent.
   B.   When in the judgment of the superintendent, there is a significant
difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different
operations of a single user, the superintendent may require that separate
monitoring facilities be installed for each source of discharge.
   C.   Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be
constructed and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility
is to enable inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the wastewater
produced by a user. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the
superintendent, it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense.
   D.   The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The superintendent may, however, when
such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow
the facility to be constructed in the public street right of way with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right of way and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   E.   There shall be ample room in or near such a sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   F.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the superintendent's
requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and
specifications. Construction must be completed within one hundred eighty (180)
days following written notification unless an extension is granted by the
superintendent. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-326: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
   A.   All users generating wastewater classified as a "nondomestic source",
as defined in section
17-302 of this chapter, shall allow the superintendent or his authorized
representative, the approval authority, state officials, and EPA upon
presentation of proper credentials:
      1.   To enter upon the user's premises where a discharge source to the
POTW is located or where records are required to be kept under the terms and
conditions of this chapter, and at reasonable times to copy these records;
      2.   To inspect at reasonable times any monitoring equipment or method or
any collection, treatment, pollution management, or discharge facilities
required under this chapter; and
      3.   To sample at reasonable times any discharge of pollutants to the
POTW.
   B.   At least annually, the city shall sample and inspect the facilities of
all significant industrial users to ascertain whether the purpose of this
chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied with. The city,
approval authority, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make the necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-327: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
   A.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be made available to the public without restriction unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
   B.   All confidential information will be available for review for the state
of Oklahoma and USEPA officials that are in direct control of the NPDES program
upon request, provided the requesting agency cites the authority under which it
is making the request and adequate arrangements are made to safeguard this
material.
   C.   No employee or officer of the city may disclose or use for his or her
private advantage, any business information which came into his or her
possession, or to which he or she gained access, by virtue of his or her
official position or employment, except as authorized by the written policy for
handling confidential information. A copy of this policy will be on file in the
office of the public works director. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-328: COMPLIANCE DATE REPORT:
Within ninety (90) days following the date of final compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement
of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to
pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a
report with the information required in subsections 17-312B3 through B12 of
this chapter. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-329: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
   A.   Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard,
after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a
new source, after the commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit
to the superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required
more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the superintendent, a report
indicating the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which
are limited by the user's wastewater discharge permit or such pretreatment
standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the
discharge reported in subsection
17-312B3 of this chapter, except that the superintendent may require more
detailed reporting of flows. At the discretion of the superintendent and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are to be furnished submitted.
   B.   The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users where the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report
required by subsection A of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by the wastewater discharge permit or pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
   C.   The reports required by this chapter shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by the superintendent, of
the pollutants contained therein which are limited by the wastewater discharge
permit and/or applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit or in the pretreatment
standard. All sampling shall be performed in accordance with subsections 17-
312B6 and B7 of this chapter. All sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments
thereto. The city shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess
and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other parties, approved by the administrator. (Ord. 1700, 9-13-2011)
   D.   If the industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the wastewater discharge permit, using test procedures approved
under 40 CFR part 136 or as specified by the permit, the results of such
monitoring shall be included in the calculation and results will be reported on
the next scheduled report to the city. Such increased monitoring frequency
shall also be indicated on the report.
   E.   If the industrial user receives any laboratory analysis, using test
procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136 or as specified by this chapter, that
is in violation of the standards as set in this chapter or the wastewater
discharge permit, the permittee will notify the superintendent of this
violation within twenty four (24) hours of the receipt of the report.
   F.   If the industrial user receives any laboratory analysis, using test
procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136 or as specified by their wastewater
discharge permit, that is in violation of the standards as set in their permit,
the industrial user has thirty (30) days to resample the waste stream for the
parameters in violation and submit the results of both sets of data to the
superintendent. This thirty (30) day period begins on the day the industry
receives the data in violation, except the industrial user is not required to
resample if:
      1.   The city performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of
at least once per month; or
      2.   The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time the user receives the results
of this sampling.
   G.   All reports required by this chapter shall contain the certification
statement in subsection I of this section and signed by an authorized
representative of the "industrial user" (as defined in section
17-302 of this chapter).
   H.   If an authorized representative is no longer accurate because of a
different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation
of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the
company, a new authorization must be submitted to the city prior to or together
with any reports to be signed by an authorization representative.
   I.   The following certification will accompany all reports submitted under
this chapter:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information submitted
is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am
aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information,
including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
(Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
17-330: MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS:
   A.   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established
by this chapter shall maintain records of all information resulting from any
monitoring activities required by this article. Such records shall include for
all samples:
      1.   The date, exact plan, method, and time of sampling and the names of
the persons taking the samples;
      2.   The dates analyses were performed;
      3.   Who performed the analyses;
      4.   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
      5.   The results of such analyses.
   B.   Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established
in this chapter shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years
all records of monitoring activities and results whether or not such monitoring
activities are required by this chapter and shall make such records available
for inspection and copying by the superintendent, director of the division of
water quality management, state department of public health, or the
environmental protection agency. This period of retention shall be extended
during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or
when requested by the city, the approval authority, or the environmental
protection agency. (Ord. 1335, 6-22-1993)
