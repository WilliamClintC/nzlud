§ 33.07  REVIEW OF APPLICATION.



   (A)   The Director, following filing of a complete application under
this chapter, and following consideration of the information included in the
application and any other evidence, shall determine:



      (1)   The extent of waiving the enforcement of the regulation
necessary to avoid the owner or owners being entitled to compensation under
Measure 37; and



      (2)   The amount of compensation to which the owner or owners
would be entitled without a waiver.



   (B)   If the Director determines that a waiver of enforcement of the
regulation is or may be needed to avoid the owner being entitled to
compensation, the Director, under the advice of the Finance Director and City
Manager, shall compare the public benefits of not applying the regulation to
the owner’s private real property to the public burden of paying the
required compensation if a waiver of enforcement of the regulation is not
granted, taking into consideration the financial resources of the city for
the payment of such claims.



   (C)   Based on this comparison, the Director shall prepare a written
report stating the result of its comparison. If the Director has determined
that a waiver of enforcement of the regulation may be needed, the report also
shall make a recommendation either to:



      (1)   Grant a license waiving enforcement of the regulation
that will avoid compensation;



      (2)   Grant a license to modify the regulation for the
claimant on the subject site so that it does not give rise to a claim for
compensation;



      (3)   Grant a license waiving enforcement of less than all the
regulations under consideration to not avoid compensation, but to reduce the
compensation to which the owner is entitled and pay the amount of reduced
compensation to which the Director believes the owner is entitled;



      (4)   Deny a waiver of enforcement of the regulation and pay
the amount of compensation to which the Director believes the owner is
entitled; or



      (5)   Take some other appropriate action, such as acquiring
the entire private real property or any portion thereof by condemnation.



   (D)   As part of the review, the Director may request a separate,
independent appraisal be conducted by an appraiser as selected by the city.
An independent appraisal shall be required when the claim equals or exceeds
$30,000. Said appraisal shall not be required for claims of $10,000 or less.



   (E)   If a value cannot be agreed upon by the claimant and the city
based on prior appraisals, a third appraisal shall be conducted by an
appraiser mutually agreed upon by the claimant and city. This third appraisal
shall determine the final value of the claim.



(Prior Code, § 2.930)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.08  CITY COUNCIL HEARING.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the hearing
shall be conducted by the City Council in accordance with the Council rules
for conduct of administrative and quasi-judicial hearings.



   (B)   At the beginning of the public hearing under this chapter, the
presiding officer or a member of city staff shall state:



      (1)   The applicable substantive criteria;



      (2)   The hearing will proceed in the following general order:
staff report; applicant’s presentation; testimony in favor of the
application; testimony in opposition to the application; rebuttal; record
closes; deliberation; and decision;



      (3)   All testimony and evidence submitted, orally or in
writing, must be directed toward the applicable approval criteria. If any
person believes that other criteria apply in addition to those addressed in
the staff report, those criteria must be listed and discussed on the record.
The presiding officer may reasonably limit oral presentations in length or
content depending upon time constraints. Either the city or the claimant may
require that the appraiser or other person relied on by the other party
attend the hearing with all relevant materials and be available for
questioning by the Council. If the person is not available, the Council may
strike from the record any information provided by the person at any stage.
Any party may submit written materials of any length while the public record
is open;



      (4)   Failure to raise an issue on the record, with sufficient
specificity and accompanied by statements or evidence sufficient to afford
the city and all parties opportunity to respond to the issue, may preclude
appeal on that issue to the appropriate appellate tribunal;



      (5)   Any party wishing a continuance or to keep open the
record must make that request while the record is still open; and



      (6)   The City Council and Mayor must disclose any ex parte
contacts, conflicts of interest, or bias before the beginning of each hearing
item and provide an opportunity for challenge. Advised parties must raise
challenges to the procedures of the hearing at the hearing and raise any
issue relative to ex parte contacts, conflicts of interest, or bias prior to
the start of the hearing.



   (C)   Any request made for an opportunity to continue the hearing to
present additional evidence or testimony or to make final written argument
may be limited or eliminated by the City Council to assure that a written
decision is made and sufficient administrative time remains thereafter to
cause payment of compensation or waiving enforcement of the regulation within
the required 180 days from the date of filing a claim. The Council shall have
sole discretion as to whether to admit evidence, but material required to be
submitted as part of the application or that the Director should have
received and considered at the time of making its review and recommendation
shall not be admitted unless the Council finds that extraordinary
circumstances beyond the control of the offering party prevented earlier
submittal. The Council may condition receipt of new information from the
claimant on the claimant stipulating to an extension of time for
consideration of the material and a waiver of the 180-day deadline provided
for under Measure 37.



   (D)   The City Council shall determine whether the following
criteria have been met:



      (1)   The application is complete;



      (2)   The claimant is a qualifying property owner under
Measure 37 as follows:



         (a)   The subject property is located within the city
and is subject to the chapter or regulation, which is the basis of the
application for claim;



         (b)   The use which the claimant alleges is restricted
under a city regulation and does not constitute a nuisance;



         (c)   The city regulation is not required as part of any
federal requirement and is not an exempt regulation;



         (d)   The owner of the property as shown on the
application was the owner of the property prior to the date the regulation
was adopted, first enforced, or applied;



         (e)   There is substantial evidence to support the claim
of reduction in the fair market value of the subject property;



         (f)   The amount of compensation potentially due has
been based on substantial evidence;



         (g)   The availability of public financial resources to
pay the claim in consideration of competing priorities in the public interest;



         (h)   The impact of waiving enforcement of the
regulation(s) or otherwise permitting the use on other properties and the
public interest; and



         (i)   Such other factors as are determined to be in the
interest of the property owner and the public to consider in determining the
claim.



      (3)   The cited regulation(s) reduce the fair market value of
the property and entitle the owner to compensation or waiver of enforcement
of the regulation pursuant to Measure 37.



   (E)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council shall
announce its decision orally. Such decision shall not be considered the final
city decision until the City Council has adopted written findings in support
of its decision. The City Council shall determine whether the applying owner
may be entitled to compensation under Measure 37 unless the city grants a
license waiving enforcement of the regulation and, if so, the amount of
compensation that may be due and shall compare the public benefits from
application of the regulation to the owner’s private real property to the
public burden of paying the required compensation to the owner if a license
waiving enforcement of the regulation is not granted, taking into
consideration the financial resources of the city for the payment of such
claims. If the City Council has determined that either compensation or a
waiver is or may be required, then based on this comparison:



      (1)   If the City Council finds that the public burden of
paying the required compensation, taking into consideration the city’s
financial resources for the payment of such claims, is greater than the
public benefit to apply the regulation to the owner’s private real
property, the City Council may grant a license waiving enforcement of the
regulation to the extent necessary to avoid the owner or owners being
entitled to compensation;



      (2)   If the City Council finds that the public benefit from
application of the regulation to the owner’s or owners’ private real
property is greater than the public burden of paying the required
compensation, taking into consideration the city’s financial resources for
the payment of such claims, the City Council may deny a license waiving
enforcement of the regulation and identify a specified amount of compensation
to be paid;



      (3)   The City Council may find that the public benefit from
application of the regulation to the owner’s private real property is
greater than the public burden of paying some of the required compensation,
taking into consideration the city’s financial resources for the payment of
such claims, but that other of the public benefits are not sufficient to
justify the public burden of paying the balance of the required compensation.
If so, the City Council may grant a license waiving enforcement of the
regulation to the limited extent necessary to avoid the owner being entitled
to compensation as to that part of the specified regulation providing public
benefit and identify a specified amount of compensation to be paid as to that
part of the regulation as to which a waiver from enforcement is not granted;



      (4)   The City Council may take some other appropriate action,
including a resolution of intent to acquire an interest in the property by
condemnation;



      (5)   The City Council, in its discretion, may impose a
condition that its decision will be effective only if the owner or owners of
the private real property sign an agreement, in a form acceptable to the
city, that waives any further claims in relation to application of the
subject regulation to the private real property as to which a license or
compensation is sought; or



      (6)   The City Council may take other appropriate action
conditional on the city receiving a defined amount of contributions from
others, such as persons who believe they would be negatively affected by an
exemption, by a specified date. In the event the City Council makes such a
conditional decision, then the Finance Department shall establish an account
into which it shall deposit all contributions the city has received for the
payment of compensation. On the date specified for receipt of the defined
amount of contributions, the Finance Department shall certify whether the
defined amount of contributions has been received. If the defined amount of
contributions has been certified as received, then the compensation shall be
paid and the license deemed denied or granted only to the limited extent
approved by the City Council, as of the payment date, if the defined amount
of contributions has been certified as not received, then the license shall
be deemed granted as of the certification date and all contributions received
by the city shall be returned to the persons who made the contributions.



   (F)   If the Council finds the criteria set forth in division (D)
above have been met, the Council shall adopt a written order (which may be
combined with the written findings and conclusion) either directing that
payment of just compensation be made to the property owner and to any other
persons holding an interest in the property, in such manner as approved by
the City Attorney, or issuing a license waiving enforcement of the regulation
in accordance with § 33.11. The City Council may delay, withhold, or
condition the entry of its written order (including placement of just
compensation funds in escrow) depending upon whether and at what time Measure
37 became effective.



   (G)   A copy of the findings, conclusion, and order shall be mailed
by first-class mail to:



      (1)   The claimant and to all other interested persons who
both submitted written testimony or testified before the City Council; and



      (2)   The government agencies that were provided notice of the
claim pursuant to § 33.06(B)(1)(c) through (B)(1)(e).



(Prior Code, § 2.935)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.09  BURDEN OF PROOF.



   The burden of proof of any material element shall be upon the claimant
for all matters required to show that the claimant is a qualifying property
owner under Measure 37 and the amount of compensation for reduced property
value caused by the cited regulation or regulations. The burden shall be upon
the city to establish that the regulation is exempt from the obligation to
pay compensation.



(Prior Code, § 2.940)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.10  STANDARDS FOR INTERPRETATION.



   (A)   Applications for claims shall be interpreted consistently with
statutory laws and judicial decisions under O.R.S. Chapter 197.



   (B)   This chapter is not intended in any way to expand the rights
or remedies available to property owners under Measure 37 or any other law.
Neither shall it be construed so as to contravene the express terms of
Measure 37.



   (C)   If the City Council has taken an action under § 33.06 and the
owner nevertheless files a court action seeking compensation or additional
compensation from the city in relation to the specified regulation as it
affects the owner’s private real property, and if a final court decision
determines that the extent of the license provided in the City Council’s
final order was not sufficient to avoid the owner(s) being entitled to
compensation or additional compensation, then the extent of any license
granted by the city shall be deemed to be the extent of any license necessary
to avoid the owner(s) being entitled to compensation or additional
compensation, effective as of the date of the Council’s decision.



(Prior Code, § 2.945)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.11  LICENSE WAIVING ENFORCEMENT OF CITY REGULATION.



   (A)   There is hereby established a city license that waives or
modifies city enforcement of one or more specified city regulations found by
the Council to reduce the value of a claimant’s real property. Such license
shall have the following characteristics:



      (1)   It shall be signed by the Director on behalf of the city
and issued only to a claimant pursuant to the process set forth in this
chapter;



      (2)   It shall be personal to the owner and nontransferable.
The license shall expire upon the licensee’s death or, in the case of
non-natural persons, its expiration or termination;



      (3)   It shall remain effective so long as the claimant owns
the property to the same extent as at the time the claim was allowed;



      (4)   Such license shall be presented to the city as part of
any application for development of the subject property for which a waiver of
the subject regulation is sought;



      (5)   The city may record the license or a memorandum of the
license in the deed records of the county.



   (B)   Issuance of a license under this section shall not cause the
repeal of the regulation(s) being challenged.



   (C)   The City Attorney is authorized to prepare an appropriate form
of license under this section.



(Prior Code, § 2.950)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.12  PAYMENT OF CLAIM.



   (A)   If the Council determines that a valid claim has been
presented and established under this chapter and sufficient funds are
available and appropriated therefor, the Council may authorize payment to the
claimant. The amount of payment shall be based on the Council’s
determination of the diminution in property value attributed to the city
regulation.



   (B)   Payment shall be tendered upon claimant’s recordation in the
County Department of Records and Elections of a notice, covenant, or
declaration in a form approved by the City Attorney that the cited
regulation(s) are applicable to the property.



(Prior Code, § 2.955)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.13  RECORD.



   (A)   The City Recorder shall maintain records of all monies paid
and licenses issued pursuant to this chapter.



   (B)   The Director shall cause a copy of any license issued under
this chapter to be mailed to the County Director of Assessment and Taxation
with a request that such information be considered in determining the
assessed value of the subject property.



(Prior Code, § 2.960)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.14  CONDITIONS RELATED TO FUTURE COURT DECISIONS.



   (A)   If the City Council grants a license or limited license as a
means to avoid having to compensate, or as a means to limit compensation to,
an owner or owners under Measure 37, and if, based on a subsequent appellate
court interpretation or invalidation of Measure 37, in the same or another
case, the applying owner was not entitled to compensation in relation to the
regulation from which the license waiving the regulation was granted, then
the waiver or limited waiver shall be deemed to have been invalid and
ineffective as of and after the date of the City Council’s order granting
the waiver or limited waiver. Any such invalidity and ineffectiveness shall
be limited as necessary to avoid the city being required to compensate the
owner under Measure 37.



   (B)   The City Council may make a decision to pay compensation under
this chapter conditional on the owner or owners signing an agreement, in a
form acceptable to the city, that, if an appellate court subsequently
interprets or invalidates Measure 37, in the same or another case, in a
manner such that the owner was or owners were not entitled to compensation in
relation to the subject regulation, then the owner or owners will repay the
compensation received by the owner or owners to the city, with the repayment
obligation being a lien against the subject private real property until paid.
Whether or not the owner or owners sign such an agreement, if an appellate
court subsequently interprets or invalidates Measure 37, in the same or
another case, in a manner such that the owner was or owners were not entitled
to compensation in relation to the subject regulation, then the owner or
owners shall repay the compensation received by the owner or owners to the
city, with the repayment obligation being a lien against the subject private
real property until paid.



   (C)   Any such repayment obligation and lien shall be limited as
necessary to avoid the city being required to compensate the owner under
Measure 37.



(Prior Code, § 2.965)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.15  NO RE-APPLICATION.



   If a claim has been granted by the city or another jurisdiction based
on one or more land use regulations on a property or an application is denied
or withdrawn prior to the issuance of a final written order by the City
Council, no application for the same or substantially similar compensation
claim may be made by the owner or subsequent owner(s) of the subject property.



(Prior Code, § 2.970)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.16  VALIDITY OF CITY COUNCIL ACTION.



   No failure of any person or body to comply with a procedural
requirement set out in this chapter shall invalidate any action of the City
Council under this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 2.975)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.17  ATTORNEY FEES ON DELAYED COMPENSATION.



   If a demand made under Measure 37 and this chapter is denied or not
fully paid within 180 days of the date of filing a completed demand, the
owner’s reasonable attorney fees and expenses necessary to collect
compensation will be added as additional compensation, provided compensation
is awarded to the owner. If such demand is denied, not fully paid, or other
action taken under Measure 37, within 180 days of the date of filing the
completed demand, and the owner commences suit or action to collect
compensation, if the city is the prevailing party in such action, then the
city shall be entitled to any sum which a court, including any appellate
court, may adjudge reasonable attorney’s fees. In the event the city is the
prevailing party and is represented by in-house counsel, the prevailing party
shall nevertheless be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees based upon
the attorney fee rates and charges reasonably and generally accepted in the
city for the type of legal services performed.



(Prior Code, § 2.980)  (Ord. 2004-08, passed 2-1-2004)



§ 33.18  ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES.



   (A)   The City Manager or designee shall be responsible for the
administration and enforcement of this code. In accordance with approved
procedures, the City Manager may employ qualified officers, inspectors,
assistants, and other employees as shall be necessary to carry out the
provisions of this section.



   (B)   The City Manager shall designate in writing the appropriate
department responsible for the administration and enforcement of any
provisions of the code.



   (C)   The City Manager or Council may add other and additional
duties and regulations to the enforcement and administration responsibilities
of any department.



   (D)   In order to carry out the duties set forth in division (B)
above, the director of any department designated for the administration and
enforcement for any provisions of the code may:



      (1)   Adopt written policies and procedures for the
enforcement of applicable code provisions and laws; and



      (2)   Establish enforcement priorities based on the number of
personnel, public safety, and welfare factors as well as such priorities as
may be established by City Council.



   (E)   In order to gain compliance with the provisions for which a
department is given responsibility, the director (or his or her delegate) of
said department may do any or all of the following:



      (1)   Obtain voluntary compliance;



      (2)   Cause appropriate action to be instituted in a court of
competent jurisdiction (including the Municipal Court);



      (3)   Issue code violation citation(s) to the person(s)
responsible for the violation; and



      (4)   Take such other action as the director, in the exercise
of his or her discretion, deems appropriate.



   (F)   The director or designee may enter property (including the
interior of structures) at all reasonable times whenever an inspection is
deemed necessary to enforce any regulation under said department’s
jurisdiction as set forth in division (B) above.



   (G)   In the case of entry into areas of property that are plainly
enclosed to create privacy and prevent access by unauthorized persons, the
following steps shall be taken:



      (1)   If any structure on the property is occupied, the
director shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If entry
is refused, the director may attempt to obtain entry by obtaining an
inspection warrant; or



      (2)   If the property is unoccupied, the director shall
contact the property owner (or other person(s) having charge or control
thereof) and request entry; if refused, the director may obtain entry through
an inspection warrant.

ANNUAL FEE ADJUSTMENT




§ 34.01  ADJUSTMENT OF FEES AND CHARGES.



   The intent of §§ 34.01 through 34.03 is to provide the City Council
with a rational process for setting fees and charges. The philosophy is to
base user fees on cost-of-service so the city will be able to recover the
costs associated with delivering a service to an individual or group. By
recovering the cost of providing a service, the rest of the community is not
subsidizing services benefitting individuals. (Prior Code, § 2.600)  (Ord.
1989-04, passed 2-13-1989)



§ 34.02  LICENSES, PERMITS, FEES, AND CHARGES.



   (A)   Licenses, permits, fees, and charges will be adjusted by
Council resolution in July each year.



   (B)   Licenses, permits, fees, and charges subject to §§ 34.01
through 34.03 shall be reviewed with a cost-of-service study every five
years. Following completion of each cost-of-service study and its review
and/or amendment by the Council, the Council shall designate by resolution
the cost of all licenses, permits, fees, and charges subject to §§ 34.01
through 34.03. Subsequent adjustments prior to completion of the next
required cost-of-service study shall be made in accordance with § 34.03.
Unless specifically exempted, all city licenses, permits, fees, and charges
are subject to § 34.03.



(Prior Code, § 2.601)  (Ord. 1989-04, passed 2-13-1989)



§ 34.03  BASIS FOR ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.



   (A)   Adjustments to fees and charges shall be based on the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) or the percentage of the general wage adjustment for city
employees. Fees and charges may be adjusted by the Portland Area Consumer
Price Index for all urban consumers, as compiled and published by the U.S.
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.



   (B)   If the CPI is used for the annual adjustment, changes will be
equal to the percentage change in the Portland Area CPI for all urban
consumers in one 12-month period. The comparison month will be January of
each year.



   (C)   Fees and charges may be adjusted by the fiscal year general
wage adjustment. The amount will be equal to the percentage adjustment in
wages for the same fiscal year of the fee increase.



(Prior Code, § 2.605)  (Ord. 1989-04, passed 2-13-1989)



§ 34.04  MUNICIPAL UTILITY BILLINGS; PRIORITIZATION OF PAYMENT
SUSPENSION/TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICE.



   (A)   Fees, taxes, rates, and other charges imposed or collected by
the city designed to pay costs associated with delivery (either by the city
or other governmental unit) of services may be made part of and included with
any billing statement(s) issued by the city for its municipal water and
electricity utilities.



   (B)   Payments received by the city as part of its municipal utility
billing process shall be prioritized so charges imposed for the city’s
water and electricity utilities are, in that order, deemed the last to be

(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.26  TAX IMPOSED.



   (A)   Effective January1, 2018, each occupant shall pay a TLT in the
amount of 2.50% of the rent. The occupant shall pay the TLT with the rent to
the local tax trustee. TLT amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.
The local tax trustee shall maintain records of all rent charged and TLT
payments received. If rent is paid in installments a proportionate share of
the TLT shall be paid by the occupant to the local tax trustee with each
installment unless the occupant pays the entire amount with the first payment.



   (B)   Bills, receipts or invoices provided to occupants shall list
the city TLT separately and must accurately state the amount of tax. All
amounts listed as TLT on invoices, bills or receipts must be reported as TLT
and, after collection, must be turned over to the city, less the 5%
administrative charge.



   (C)   The TLT shall automatically sunset on December 31, 2027,
unless re-authorized by the City Council.



(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.27  COLLECTION OF TAX BY LOCAL TAX TRUSTEE.



   (A)   Every local tax trustee shall collect the TLT at the time rent
is paid, unless an exemption applies. If payment is by credit card, for
purposes of this section, payment is made at the time credit card information
is provided to local tax trustee, not when the local tax trustee ultimately
receives credit for the transaction. While holding the payment in trust for
the city, a local tax trustee may commingle the tax proceeds with the local
tax trustee's funds, but the local tax trustee is not the owner of tax
proceeds, except that, when a return is filed, the local tax trustee becomes
the owner of the administrative fee authorized to be retained. Local tax
trustees may choose to file returns and remit payment based on amounts
accrued but not yet collected. The local tax trustee is liable for any TLT
that should have been collected from the occupant, except in cases of
nonpayment of rent by the occupant.



   (B)   Upon request of the city, local tax trustees must provide all
physical addresses of transient lodging facilities within the city limits and
the related contact information, including the name and mailing address, of
the general manager, agent, owner, host or other responsible person for the
location.



(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.28  LIABILITY FOR TAX.

provide booking service are jointly and severally liable for the tax.



(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.29  EXEMPTIONS.



   No TLT shall be imposed upon:



   (A)   Any person for that portion of the occupancy that is more than
30 consecutive calendar days;



   (B)   Any occupant whose rent is valued at less than $2 per day;



   (C)   Rent paid for a hospital room or to a medical clinic,
convalescent home, assisted living facility, hospice, group home for aged or
disabled persons, or similar facility;



   (D)   Occupancy by an employee of the Federal or state government on
official business provided the employee seeking the exemption provides
reasonable documentation to the operator; or



   (E)   A dwelling unit at a nonprofit youth or church camp, nonprofit
conference center or other nonprofit facility.



(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.30  REGISTRATION OF OPERATOR; FORM AND CONTENT; EXECUTION; AND
CERTIFICATION OF AUTHORITY.



   (A)   Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an
operator shall provide a completed registration form to the Tax Administrator
within 15 calendar days after commencing business. The registration form
shall require the operator to provide the name of the business, any separate
business address, and other information as the Tax Administrator may require
to implement this subchapter. Operators who own or operate transient lodging
facilities in Forest Grove shall provide the address of the lodging facility.
The registration form shall be signed by the operator. The Tax Administrator
shall, within ten days after registration, issue without charge a certificate
of authority to collect the TLT. The obligation to collect the TLT is imposed
once rent for transient lodging is paid, even if the registration form has
not been filed or if the certificate has not been issued. If rent transaction
is facilitated online, the certificate of authority must be able to be viewed
by the occupant by clicking on link to the certificate of authority at a
reasonable place during the payment transaction.



   (B)   Certificates shall be non-assignable and nontransferable, and
shall be surrendered to the Tax Administrator when the business is sold or
transferred or when a lodging facility ceases to operate at the location
specified in the registration form. Each certificate issued to an operator
for a specific lodging facility shall be prominently displayed at the lodging
facility and include:



      (1)   The name of the operator;



      (2)   The address of the transient lodging facility;



      (3)   The date the certificate was issued; and



      (4)   The certificate number as assigned by the Tax
Administrator.

the Tax Administrator on a monthly basis on the tenth day of the month for
the preceding month, reporting the amount of tax due during the quarter and
accompanied by remittance of all tax collected, less a 5% administration fee.



   (B)   The local tax trustee is entitled to the administration fee.
If a transient lodging facility has multiple operators they are not entitled
to retain additional fees.



   (C)   Remittances are delinquent if not made by the tenth day of the
month for the preceding month.



   (D)   Returns shall show the gross rents collected, taxable rents,
the total amount of TLT collected and the amount of the administrative fee
retained by the local tax trustee. Returns shall also show the exempt and
excluded rents and the basis for exemptions and exclusions.



   (E)   Tax returns and remittances may be submitted in person or by
mail. If the return and remittance is mailed, the postmark shall be
considered the date of delivery.



   (F)   The Tax Administrator may extend the time for making any
return or remittance of the tax by up to 30 days. No further extension shall
be granted, except by the City Council. Any local tax trustee to whom an
extension is granted shall pay interest at the rate of 1% per month on the
amount of the remittance due without proration for a fraction of a month. If
a return is not filed, and the remittance and interest due is not paid by the
end of the extension granted, then the interest shall become a part of the
tax for computation of penalties.



(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.32  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.



   (A)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, interest shall
be added to the overall tax amount due at a rate of 1% for each month, or
fraction of a month without proration for portions of a month, from the time
the return was originally required to be filed by the local tax trustee to
the time of payment.



   (B)   Penalty. If the local tax trustee fails to file a return or
pay the tax as required, a penalty shall be imposed upon the local tax
trustee in the amount of 10% of the amount of tax due in addition to the
amount of the tax.  Any local tax trustee who fails to file a return or pay
the tax as required on or before 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent, shall pay a second penalty of 15% of the
amount of the tax due in addition to the amount of tax and the original 10%
penalty.



   (C)   Financial obligation. Every penalty imposed, and any interest
that accrues, becomes a part of the financial obligation required to be paid
by the local tax trustee and remitted to the city.



   (D)   Enforcement. If at any time a local tax trustee fails to remit
any amount owed in taxes, interest or penalties, the city or an authorized
designee such as the Oregon Department of Revenue, may enforce collection on
behalf of the city of the owed amount.



(Ord. 2017-13, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 34.33  DEFICIENCY DETERMINATION; FRAUD, EVASION LOCAL TAX TRUSTEE DELAY.

provide notice of the deficiency to the local tax trustee, who shall remit
deficiencies within ten business days of the deficiency notice. Notice may be

section shall be extended if the local tax trustee timely requests a

fraudulent return, or otherwise violates or attempts to violate this

taxes, penalties, and interest as determined by the Tax Administrator to be
due is a prerequisite to filing a petition for redetermination. Filing a
petition for re-determination and refund is a prerequisite to seeking
judicial review.



   (B)   If a petition for redetermination is filed within the
allowable period, the Tax Administrator shall reconsider the determination
and grant an oral hearing if requested. The Tax Administrator shall grant the
petitioner an oral hearing with ten days' notice of the time and place.

petitioner and all amounts due must be paid within ten business days of
mailing of the City Council decision.

   (A)   Designation of property as a historic or cultural landmark may
be proposed by a property owner or his or her authorized agent, by the HLB,
or by the City Council. An application shall be filed with the Community
Development Department, using forms provided by the Director.



   (B)   Designation of property as a historic or cultural landmark is
classified as a Type IV procedure, and is subject to all of the procedures
and timelines outlined in the Development Code. Designation requires public
hearings before the following review bodies:



      (1)   Historic Landmarks Board; and



      (2)   City Council.



   (C)   If the HLB acts to reject a proposed designation, no further
action shall be taken unless the applicant files an appeal of the action with
the City Council.



   (D)   If the Council acts to approve the proposed designation, or to
approve the proposal with modifications, it shall adopt an ordinance setting
forth the findings of fact on which such approval is based, and order an
amendment of the zoning map to label the designated property with the HL
overlay zone. Immediately upon designation of the property as a landmark, the
designated landmark (not the entire tax lot) shall be subject to the
provisions of this subchapter.



   (E)   Individual historic resources listed on the National Register
of Historic Places shall automatically receive landmark designation on the
date the property is listed. However, a landmark that is removed from the
National Register of Historic Places will retain its local landmark
designation unless the designation is removed through the procedures listed
in this subchapter.

proposed by a property owner or his or her authorized agent, by the HLB, or
by the City Council. An application shall be filed with the Community
Development Department.



   (B)   Removal of a designated landmark from the Register is
classified as a Type IV procedure, and is subject to all of the notice
procedures and timelines outlined in the Development Code. Removal of the HL
overlay designation requires two sequential public hearings before the
following review bodies:



      (1)   Historic Landmarks Board; and



      (2)   City Council.



   (C)   The HLB shall make its decision on the basis of the criteria
contained in § 35.073 and shall make specific findings of fact as to whether
the landmark has lost its historic or cultural value based on these criteria.



   (D)   If the Board acts to deny a request for removal of a landmark
from the Register, no further action shall be taken unless the applicant
files an appeal of the Board’s action with the City Council.



   (E)   Within 60 days from the date of the recommendation by the HLB
to approve a request to remove a landmark from the Register, the City Council
shall conduct a public hearing to consider the request and recommendation of
the HLB. Public notice shall be provided in accordance with Type IV
procedures. Following the public hearing, the Council shall act to approve
the removal of the landmark designation as requested, or to remove some
portion of the landmark from the Register, or to deny the request. When
removing a landmark designation from the Register, the ordinance shall amend
the zoning map to remove the HL overlay zone from the property.

roll of the County Assessor. The list of residents shall be drawn from the
most recent listings posted in the unified billing accounts of the city.



   (C)   The purpose of the notice shall be to inform or remind the
owners and occupants of each landmark listed on the Historic Register that
such landmark has been found by the city to be a significant historic or
cultural landmark, and that its listing on the Historic Register subjects the
property to certain review requirements.



   (D)   The notice shall also include, at a minimum, the following:



      (1)   A brief explanation of the existence and function of the

§ 35.096  PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNATION OF REGISTER TREES.



   (A)   Inventory. An inventory shall be conducted of significant
trees (including groves) which could qualify for being placed in the
Register. Criteria are as follows.



      (1)   Tree criteria. An individual tree shall be considered
significant if the Community Forestry Commission (CFC) finds:



         (a)   The tree has a distinctive size, shape, or
location which warrants a significant status;



         (b)   The tree has a special botanical significance as a
specimen in the city area;



         (c)   The tree possesses exceptional beauty which
warrants a significant status;



         (d)   The tree is significant due to a functional or
aesthetic relationship to a natural resource; and



         (e)   Along with one of the above, the tree is
significant based upon its association with historic figures, properties, or
the general growth and development of the city.



      (2)   Grove criteria. A tree grove shall be considered
significant if the CFC finds:



         (a)   The grove is relatively mature and evenly aged;



         (b)   The grove has a purity of species composition, is
of a rare or unusual nature, or is an exceptional example of a type of forest
such as riparian or woodland;



         (c)   The grove is in a healthy growing condition;



         (d)   The grove has a crucial functional and/or
aesthetic relationship to a natural resource; or



         (e)   The grove has a historic significance based upon
its association with historic figures, properties, or the general growth and
development of the city.



   (B)   Update of tree inventory. Provisions shall be made for
periodic updates of the tree inventory and possible Register as required by
changes in the number and condition of significant trees.



   (C)   Preparation of potential register tree list. The CFC shall
review the inventory and other pertinent information and draw up a proposed
list of significant trees and groves of trees that the CFC believes meets the
criteria to be placed on the Register.



   (D)   Notification. Prior to the public hearings specified in
division (E) below, each property owner of the tree or trees under
consideration for Register status shall be notified by mail. The notice shall
inform tree owners that they can request in writing that the tree(s) on their
property not be considered for Register status. Attached to the
recommendation to Council shall be a list of current property owners who have
requested their tree(s) not be placed on the Register. The notice shall also
include, at a minimum, the following:



      (1)   A brief explanation of the existence and function of the
city’s Register of Significant Trees;



      (2)   A statement that particular actions affecting the tree
or grove will require prior review and action by the CFC or city staff, as
provided in the Development Code;



      (3)   A statement that the CFC is available and willing to
review on an informal basis any plans that may be prepared for work which
might affect the tree or grove; and



      (4)   A statement that the city can provide resource materials
and guidance in developing plans for work which may affect the tree or grove.



   (E)   Public hearings. The designation and updating of the register
tree list is classified as a Type IV procedure and is subject to all of the
procedures and timelines outlined in § 10.1.710 of the Development Code.
Designation requires public hearing before the following review bodies:



      (1)   Community Forestry Commission; and



      (2)   City Council.



(Prior Code, § 9.305)  (Ord. 2009-04, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 35.097  REMOVAL OF REGISTER TREE DESIGNATION.



   (A)   Removal of a designated tree from the Register may be proposed
by a property owner or his or her authorized agent, by the CFC, or by the
City Council. In proposing removal, an application shall be prepared and
filed with the city, using prescribed forms. Notice of the public hearing
shall be given as prescribed in §§ 10.1.610 and 10.1.620 of the Development
Code for a Type III review.



   (B)   The CFC shall consider and act on the request. The CFC shall
act to recommend approval of the request as submitted, approve the request
with modifications, or delay the request.



      (1)   The CFC shall make its decision on the basis of the
criteria contained in § 35.096 and shall make specific findings of fact as
to whether the tree has lost its significant value based on these criteria.



      (2)   The CFC has one of two options as follows:



         (a)   The CFC can stay the request for removal from the
Register by making specific findings of fact as to why the tree should be
retained on the Register, and request review by the City Council. Council
review shall meet the notice and public hearing requirements of § 10.1.715
of the Development Code for quasi-judicial hearings. The City Council can
approve the request, approve with conditions, or deny the request; or



         (b)   The CFC can require a delay of up to one year to
explore methods and options of retaining the tree on the Register in its
present location, or having the tree moved at a cost to the applicant of less
than $300. If at the end of one year the tree has not been moved or
protective arrangements completed, the owner may remove the tree from the
Register. Under an appeal of the delay requirement, the City Council has the
option of denying a request for removal from the Register.



(Prior Code, § 9.310)  (Ord. 2009-04, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 35.098  ANNUAL NOTIFICATION OF REGISTER TREE OWNERS.



   (A)   Once each year, between January 1 and April 1, the city shall
mail a notice to the owners and occupants of the property on which each
register tree is located.



   (B)   The list of owners shall be drawn from the most recent tax
roll of the County Assessor. The list of occupants shall be drawn from the
most recent listings posted in the unified billing accounts of the city.



   (C)   The purpose of the notice shall be to inform or to remind the
owners and occupants of the property that such tree or grove has been found
by the city to be a significant tree or grove, and that its listing on the
Register subjects the tree or grove to certain review requirements.

described above, an inventory of personal property and the contents of open
containers will also be conducted in the following locations:



         (a)   Any other type of unlocked compartments that are a

§ 35.111  INVENTORIES OF PERSON IN POLICE CUSTODY.



   (A)   This policy is meant to exclusively apply to the process for
conducting an inventory of the personal property and possessions of a person

or constitutional right(s) that law enforcement officers may employ to search
persons or search and seize possessions for other purposes.

vehicle; or



      (2)   Custody of the person will be transferred to another law

into a holding room or a police vehicle, whichever occurs first. However, if
there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the safety of either the
officer(s) or the person in custody is at risk, an inventory will be done as
soon as is safely practical prior to the transfer of custody to another law
enforcement agency or facility.



      (2)   To complete the inventory of the personal property in
the possession of such person, the officer will remove all items of personal
property from the clothing worn by such person. In addition, the officer will
also remove all items of personal property from all open containers in the
possession of such person.



      (3)   Inventories of the contents of a closed container in the
possession of such person should only be conducted when:



         (a)   The closed container is to be placed in the
immediate possession of such person at the time that person is placed in the
secure portion of a custodial facility, police vehicle, or secure police
holding room;



         (b)   Such person requests the closed container be with
them in the secure portion of a police vehicle or a secure police holding
room; or



         (c)   The closed container is designed for carrying
money and/or small valuables on or about the person. This includes, but is
not limited to, closed purses, closed coin purses, closed wallets, and closed
fanny packs.

to be retained in the possession of the respective law enforcement agency and
a copy of that receipt will be tendered to the person in custody when such
person is released to the facility or agency accepting custody of such
person; and



      (2)   The property will be dealt with in such manner as
directed by the Police Department.



   (G)   All items of personal property not left in the immediate
possession of the person in custody and not dealt with as provided in
division (C)(5) of this section, will be released to the facility or agency
accepting custody of the person so that they may:



      (1)   Hold the property for safekeeping on behalf of the
person in custody; and



      (2)   Prepare and deliver a receipt, as may be required by
O.R.S. 133.455, for any valuables held on behalf of the person in custody.

§ 36.07  PROJECT CERTIFICATION.



   (A)   The Director may not certify a vertical housing development
project under O.R.S. § 307.857 unless the project meets all requirements of
this section:



      (1)   A complete application with all information required by
§ 36.06(B) is submitted to the city.



      (2)   The project must be entirely located within a vertical

(Ord. 2018-03, passed 7-17-2018)



§ 36.08  CERTIFIED PROJECT CRITERIA.



   (A)   The city will evaluate each complete project application to
determine whether or not to certify the proposed project. The city's
preference is that projects include low-income housing as defined by this
chapter.



   (B)   A project to qualify for city certification must satisfy each
of the following minimum criteria:



      (1)   The project must be entirely located within an approved
VHDZ. A VHDZ does not obligate the city to certify a project as qualifying
for the VHDZ partial tax exemption.



      (2)   The city will strive to inform non-profit agencies about
the city's VHDZ program and preference for low-income housing. The city will
allow the use of project-based vouchers as an eligible source of providing
low-income affordable housing.



      (3)   The project must include one or more equalized floors as
determined by the city. If a project has at least one equalized floor of low
income residential housing the taxable value of the land necessary for the
project may be certified for partial tax emption. Land not necessary for the
project may not be certified for partial land tax exemption.



      (4)   The project must be comprised of a multiple-story
building, or a group of buildings, including at least one multiple-story
building, so that a portion of the project is to be used for non-residential
uses and a portion of the project is to be used for residential use.



      (5)   A portion of the project must be committed for
residential use and a portion of the project must be committed to
non-residential use. The commitment to non-residential use must be
accomplished as follows:



      (6)   At least 50% of the project's ground floor that fronts
on the primary public street must be committed to non-residential use. If a
project has access to only one public street, the square footage of
driveways, loading docks, bike storage, garbage and recycling receptacles and
building entryways shall be excluded before applying the 50% test. For the
project's ground floor to be considered committed to non-residential use, all
ground floor interior spaces that front on the primary public street must be
constructed to building code standards for commercial use. Such ground floor
interior spaces on the primary public street may be used for commercial
purposes and/or live-work units upon completion. The non-residential
component of the live-work unit must have an entry to street level entrances
of the project.



   (C) The primary public street shall be the highest order street in the
city's street classification system or as otherwise determined by the
Director after consultation with the applicant. The Director's decision as to
the primary public street shall be final.

and qualifies for a partial property tax exemption.



   (B)   The notification described above in division (A) must be
delivered to the County Assessor in writing on or before April 1 preceding
the first tax year for which the partial property tax exemption is sought.



   (C)   Except as modified by divisions (D) and (E) of this section,
the partial property tax exemption applies to the construction or
rehabilitation of real property improvements associated with the certified
project and the inclusion of low income residential housing on the certified
project, in each of the tax years for the exemption applies.



   (D)   The eligible partial property tax exemption for a certified
project equals 20% multiplied by the number of fully equalized floors up to
four equalized floors for all associated buildings qualifying for the
property tax exemption in the tax year that are:



      (1)   For residential use; and



      (2)   Constructed or rehabilitated as part of a certified
vertical housing development project. For purposes of calculating the partial
property tax exemption, the equalized floor quotient is rounded down to the
whole numbers reflecting only fully equalized floors up to a maximum of four
equalized floors.



   (E)   The partial property tax exemption on a certified project is
available for ten consecutive years beginning with the first tax year in
which as of the assessment date, the project is occupied or ready for
occupancy following its approval by the city as a certified project.



   (F)   If during the period of partial tax exemption, any part of a
project dedicated for residential use is converted to or used as
non-residential area, the County Assessor and the city shall be notified by
the project owner of such change as required by this chapter. The County
Assessor and the city shall also be notified in writing by the project owner
if any part of a certified project dedicated to low-income residential
housing is converted to other purposes or is otherwise used in a manner that
does not comply with the low-income residential housing requirements of this
chapter.



   (G)   In order to receive a partial property tax exemption for a
certified project, the certified project owner must notify the County
Assessor. The certified project owner must provide the County Assessor with
the following information:



      (1)   A letter requesting the VHDZ partial property tax
exemption in accordance with the certified project approval certification.



      (2)   A copy of the final certified project application
submitted to the city for certification.



      (3)   A copy of the certified project approval certificate
issued by the city.



      (4)   A copy of the certificate(s) of occupancy issued by the
city for the certified project.



      (5)   Such fee(s), if any, as the County Assessor may require.



   (H)   The certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of
occupancy must be dated prior to January 1 of the tax assessment year for
which the exemption is requested.



   (I)   The written notice for the partial property tax exemption must
be made to the County Assessor on or before April 1 of the tax assessment
year that the exemption is sought. If proper noticed is provided to the
County Assessor the partial property tax exemption will be effective for the
first tax year for which the partial property tax exemption is eligible and
for the next nine consecutive years provided certified project eligibility is
maintained.



   (J)   If all or a portion of a certified project is decertified by
the city, that portion of the certified project shall be disqualified from
the partial property tax exemption as set forth in the notice of
decertification required by this chapter.



(Ord. 2018-03, passed 7-17-2018)

   The certified project owner must execute and record with the Washington
County Recorder a project use agreement including restrictive covenants
running with the land and equitable servitudes satisfactory to the City
Attorney. Recordation of the project use agreement is a condition precedent
to the approval of the certified project taking legal effect. The Director
may invalidate any certified project approval for failure to record the
project use agreement and provide the Director with a copy of any such
instruments. The certified project owner is responsible for the cost of
recording and providing satisfactory evidence to the Director showing such
instruments have been properly recorded.



(Ord. 2018-03, passed 7-17-2018)



§ 36.11  CERTIFIED PROJECT MODIFICATION.



   Any modification to a certified project must receive prior written

approval. The city may void or terminate project certification of all or a
portion of a certified project if modification occurs without the city's
written approval.



(Ord. 2018-03, passed 7-17-2018)

   (A)   The city either directly or its urban renewal agency may
acquire or dispose of real property located in a VHDZ for the purpose of
developing projects. Property acquired within a VHDZ may be sold at a value
determined to be reasonable and prudent by the City Council or Urban Renewal
Agency Board of Directors to encourage construction of the project. This
authority is in addition to and without prejudice to any authority that
otherwise exists under the laws of this state or an act of this city to
acquire or dispose of property.



   (B)   Development of municipally sponsored development projects may

   (A)   Transfer of ownership of a certified project must receive
prior written approval from the Director. The Director will not unreasonably
withhold its approval of transfer of ownership. The city may void or
terminate project certification of all or a portion of a certified project if
transfer of ownership occurs without the city's prior written approval except
where transfer of ownership occurs as a result of operation of law following
death or divorce.



   (B)   If there is a transfer of ownership of the certified project

   (D)   The Director may undertake remedial action that the city
determines necessary or appropriate to enforce VHDZ program requirements and
commitments provided by project applicants in the final application, project
certification and project use agreement. Remedial actions may include but are
not limited to:



      (1)   The request of written documentation demonstrating

   (E)   Prior to issuance of a notice of decertification, the Director
will provide the certified project owner with an opportunity to correct
first-time program non-compliance with a time deemed reasonable by the
Director. The Director may provide a certified project owner with an
opportunity to correct repeat program non-compliance at the Director's
discretion. A determination on how much time to provide to correct noticed
program noncompliance shall be based on factors such as:



      (1)   The severity of the noncompliance;

   (F)   When the Director has issued a notice of project noncompliance
to a certified project owner and the certified project owner has failed to
correct any noticed program noncompliance within the time identified in the
notice the Director may issue a notice of certified project decertification
and direct the Washington County Assessor to disqualify all or a portion of
the project for the partial property tax exemption under the VHDZ program.



   (G)   The effective date of a decertification is the effective date

less than 20 days after mailing the notice, to show cause, if any, why the
exemption should not be terminated.



   (B)   If the owner fails to appear and show cause why the exemption
should not be terminated, the city shall notify every known lender, and shall
allow any lender not less than 30 days after the date the notice of failure
to appear and show cause is mailed to cure any noncompliance or to provide
adequate assurance to the governing body that all noncompliance shall be
remedied.



   (C)   If the owner fails to appear and show cause why the exemption
should not be terminated, and the lender fails to cure or give adequate
assurance of the cure of noncompliance, the governing body shall adopt a
resolution stating its findings that terminate the exemption. A copy of the
resolution shall be filed within ten days after its adoption with the County
Assessor, and a copy shall be sent to the owner at the owner's last known
address and to the lender at the last known address of the lender within ten
days of its adoption.



   (D)   Upon the County Assessor's receipt of the governing body's
termination findings:



      (1)   The exemption granted to the housing unit or portion
under this chapter shall terminate immediately, without right of notice or
appeal;



      (2)   The property shall be assessed and taxed as other
property similarly situated is assessed and taxed;



      (3)   Notwithstanding O.R.S. § 311.235, there shall be added
to the general property tax roll, for the property in question, for the tax
year next following the presentation or discovery, to be collected and
distributed in the same manner as other real property tax, an amount equal to
the difference between the taxes assessed against the property and the taxes
that would have been assessed against the property had it not been exempt
under this chapter for each of the years, not to exceed the last ten years,
during which the property was exempt from taxation under this chapter. The
assessment and tax rolls shall show potential additional tax liability for
each property granted an exemption under this chapter because the property is
being held for future development of low-income housing.



      (4)   Additional taxes collected under this section shall be
deemed to have been imposed in the year to which the additional taxes relate.

WATER SUPPLY CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL POLICY




§ 50.25  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is:



   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply of the city from
the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the
customer’s internal distribution system(s) or the consumer’s private
water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the
public water systems;



   (B)   To promote the elimination or control of existing
cross-connections, actual or potential, between the consumer’s in-plant
potable water system(s) and nonpotable water system(s), plumbing fixtures,
and industrial piping systems; and



   (C)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of
cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent
the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.



(Prior Code, § 4.100)



§ 50.26  RESPONSIBILITY.



   (A)   The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the
water service connection.



   (B)   If, in the judgment of the Director of Public Works, an
approved backflow prevention assembly is required at the customer’s water
service connection or within the customer’s private water system for the
safety of the water system, the Director or designee shall give written
notice to the customer to install approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at
specific location(s) on the customer’s premises. The customer shall
immediately install the approved assembly(s) at the customer’s own expense.



   (C)   Failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the customer to
install, have tested, and maintain the assembly(s) shall be grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until the requirements have been
satisfactorily met.



(Prior Code, § 4.105)



§ 50.27  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   APPROVED. Accepted by the Director and/or State Health Division
applicable specifications stated or cited in this subchapter or as suitable
for the proposed use.



   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the
premises other than the water purveyor’s approved public water supply will
be considered an AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. These AUXILIARY WATERS may include
water from another purveyor’s public potable water supply, or any natural
source, such as a well, spring, river, stream, and the like, or used waters
or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they
may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which
the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.



   BACKFLOW. The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either
backpressure or backsiphonage.



   BACKFLOW PREVENTER. An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.



      (1)   AIR-GAP. The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying
water to a tank, plumbing, fixture, or other device and the flood level rim
of said vessel. An approved AIR-GAP shall be at least double the diameter of
the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the overflow rim of the vessel;
and in no case less than one inch.



      (2)   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE ASSEMBLY. An assembly of two
independently acting, approved check valves together with a hydraulically
operating, mechanically independent differential pressure relief valve,
located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check
valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing
shut-off valves at each end of the assembly. The entire ASSEMBLY shall meet
the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and a
field evaluation program resulting in an approval by a recognized and State
Health Division-approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies.
The ASSEMBLY shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the
two check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure between the
pressure on the public water supply side of the assembly. At cessation of a
normal flow, the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the
pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of
either of the check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to
maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by
discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per
square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be
approved, these assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing and
maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the assembly will
be submerged.



      (3)   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY. An assembly of two
independently operating, approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off
valves on each end of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for
the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet design and
performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and a field
evaluation program resulting in an approval by a recognized and State Health
Division-approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. To be
approved, these assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing and
maintenance.



   BACKPRESSURE. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or
substances, under pressure, into the distribution pipes of a potable water
supply system from any source other than the intended source.

substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from
any source other than the intended source.



   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the potable water by
sewage, industrial fluids, or waste fluids, compounds, or other materials, to
a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to public health through
poisoning or through the spread of disease.



   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any actual or potential physical connection or
arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping
systems, one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water,
or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of
which, backflow may occur into the potable water system. This would include
any temporary connections, such as swing connections, removable sections,
four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivels, or change-over
devices or sliding multi-port tubes.



   CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROLLED. A connection between a potable water
system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention
assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously
afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.



   CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL BY CONTAINMENT. The installation of an
approved backflow prevention assembly at the water service connection to any
customer’s premises where it is not physically and economically feasible to
find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential
cross-connections within the customer’s water system; or, it shall mean the
installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line
leading to and supplying a portion of the customer’s water system where
there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively
eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection.



   DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS or DIRECTOR. The Director is authorized and is
responsible for implementation of an effective cross-connection control
program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this code.



   DEGREE OF HAZARD. The term is derived from an evaluation of the
potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the
potable water system.



      (1)   HEALTH HAZARD. Any condition, device, or practice in the
water system and its operation which could, in the judgment of the Director,
create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer.

types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable
water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in
fluid form; plating acids and aikalines; circulating cooling waters connected
to an open cooling tower and/or towers that are chemically or biologically
treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such
as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, irrigation canals, or systems, and
the like; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions, and
other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for
fire fighting purposes.



   POLLUTION. The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic,
or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to
constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a
degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which
does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use.



   WATER, NONPOTABLE. Water that is not safe for human consumption or is
of questionable potability.



   WATER, POTABLE. Water that, according to recognized standards, is safe
for human consumption.



   WATER, SERVICE CONNECTION. The terminal end of a service connection
from the public potable water system (i.e., where the water purveyor loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the customer’s water system). If a meter is installed at the end of the
service connection, then the SERVICE CONNECTION shall mean the downstream end
of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line
ahead of any meter or any backflow prevention assembly located at the point
of delivery to the customer’s water system. SERVICE CONNECTION shall also
include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary
or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.



   WATER, USED. Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public

handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system
that have been subject to deterioration in quality.



         (c)   When premises have:



            1.   Internal cross-connection(s) that cannot be
permanently corrected or controlled;



            2.   Intricate plumbing and piping arrangements; or



            3.   Where entry to all parts of the premises is
not readily accessible for inspection, making it impracticable or impossible
to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public
water system shall be protected against backflow by installing an approved
backflow prevention assembly in the service line.



      (3)   The type of protective assembly required under division
(B)(2) above shall meet all State Health Division standards in addition to
the requirements of this chapter. The type of protective devices required
will depend on the existing degree of hazard, as follows:



         (a)   On premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as stated in division (B)(2)(a) above and it is not subject to any of
the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly.



         (b)   On premises where there is water or substance that
would be objectionable, but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an
approved double check valve assembly.



         (c)   On premises where there is any material dangerous
to health that is handled in a manner that creates an actual or potential
hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected
by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions
will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.



         (d)   On premises where there are uncontrolled
cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall
be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.



         (e)   On premises where, because of security
requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or
impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public
water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either
an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises.



      (4)   Any backflow prevention assembly required by this
chapter shall be a model and size approved by the Director and the State
Health Division. The term APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY shall mean an
assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards
established by the American Waterworks Association (A.W.W.A.) entitled:



A.W.W.A. C506-84 Standards for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check
Valve Backflow Prevention Devices, or latest revision, and have met
completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the
Foundation of Cross-Connection and Hydraulic Research (F.C.C.C. & H.R.) of
the University of Southern California established by specifications of
backflow prevention assemblies (§ 10 of the most current issue of the Manual
of Cross-Connection Control). The A.W.W.A. and F.C.C.C. & H.R. standards and
specifications have been adopted by the State Health Division and are hereby
adopted by the city.



      (5)   (a)   Customers or users at premises where back-flow
prevention assemblies are installed shall have certified inspections and
operational tests made at least once per year. The Director may require
certified inspections at more frequent intervals.



         (b)   These inspections and tests shall be at the
expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly
manufacturer’s representative, Water Department personnel, or by a
certified tester approved by the State Health Division. The Director shall
ensure that these tests are made in a timely manner.



         (c)   The customer or user shall notify the Director in
advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that an official
representative may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be
repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer or user
whenever such assemblies are found to be defective.



         (d)   Records of tests, repairs, and overhauls shall be
kept and copies given to the Director.



      (6)   All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved at the
time of installation and have been properly maintained shall, except for the
inspection and maintenance requirements under division (B)(5) above, be
excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the Director is
assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever
the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than
minimum maintenance, or when the Director finds that the maintenance
constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved
backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.



      (7)   The Director may specify the location and methods of
installation of all backflow prevention devices.



      (8)   Any installation, corrective measure, disconnection, or
other change to a backflow prevention device shall be at the sole expense of
the owner or water customer. The cost of any change required in the city’s
system outside the property (i.e., between the meter and the supply line) and
any charges for cut off or disconnection shall be added to the charges
against the premises that necessitated the expenditures.



      (9)   Any person operating any mobile apparatus that uses the
city water system or water from any premises within the city must provide for
backflow prevention. These provisions are stated in divisions (B)(3), (B)(4),
(B)(5), and (B)(7) above.



(Prior Code, § 4.115)



§ 50.29  CROSS-CONNECTION INSPECTIONS.



   (A)   No water shall be delivered to any structure hereafter built
within the city or within areas served by city water until the structure has
been inspected by the city for possible cross-connections and has been
approved as being free of cross-connections.



   (B)   The customer’s system shall be open for inspection at all
reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine
whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violations of these regulations, exist. When such conditions become know, the
Director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by
provided for a physical break in the service line until the customer has
corrected the condition in conformance with state and city laws relating to
plumbing and water supplies. All inspections as stipulated in this section
shall be made by and at the expense of the city.



   (C)   In accordance with § 50.10, authorized employees of the city
shall have free access at proper hours of the day to all parts of buildings
or premises for the purpose of inspecting the condition of the pipes,
fixtures, and other appurtenances, and the manner in which the water is being
used.



   (D)   If access to the premises is refused, the city shall
discontinue water service to the premises.



(Prior Code, § 4.120)

   (A)   (1)   Any backflow prevention device that may be required
by the city or the state to be installed on property for the protection of
the water supply shall be tested at the time of installation and anytime the
device is moved or relocated, immediately after relocation or moving.



      (2)   The property owner must forward the results of such
testing to the city’s Department of Community Development within ten days
of the date of installation or relocation.



   (B)   The property owner must order and cause to be performed a test
of each backflow prevention device annually, or within 30 days after the
anniversary date of the initial testing. The city may require more frequent
testing in order to assure that the device is properly functioning in those
installations which present a serious health hazard as determined by the city.



   (C)   If the city’s Department of Community Development has not
received the results of the test within 30 days of the anniversary date for
annual testing or within ten days of the date of the device, or the date of
city’s discovery that the device was installed without testing as
applicable, the city may order the test and add the cost of the test onto the
property owner’s water bill.



   (D)   (1)   If the results of the test ordered by the city or the
property owner indicate that repairs are necessary, the repairs must be made
and a new test made and results of the test forwarded to the city’s
Department of Community Development within ten days of the date of the first
test.



      (2)   If the city’s Department of Community Development has
not received evidence of the repairs and the results of the second test
within ten days of the first test, the city may have the repairs made and
second test made and add the cost to the property owner’s water bill. This
section applies to all tests and repairs until the tests show the backflow
preventer device is functioning properly.



   (E)   The city, in accordance with §§ 50.26 and 50.28(B)(1), may
discontinue the water service of any person who refused or fails to pay for
testing or repair, and have the charges added to the customer’s water bill.

   (B)   Determination of consumption. To determine the consumption, a
meter shall be installed by the city upon the consumer’s premises at a
point convenient for the city’s service. The city will keep an accurate
account on its books of the electric energy consumption. The account shall be
accepted as prima facie evidence of the consumption of the consumer. Should
the meter fail to register, the consumption will be estimated from the amount
used in a corresponding month; should there be no corresponding month, then
the consumption will be estimated upon the average of all previous months.
Where it is not practical to meter service, consumption will be based on
standard usage for device(s) using electrical energy.



   (C)   Interruption of service. In case the supply of energy is
interrupted by reason of accident or otherwise, the city shall not be liable
for damages by reason of such failure. It shall in no case be a condition
precedent to the city’s right to recover hereunder, to allege or to prove
that no interruption in the supply of energy has occurred.



   (D)   Delinquent accounts. All charges for electric energy shall be
due and payable 15 days after the date of the bill. If not so paid, they
shall become delinquent and service may be disconnected. If a consumer
violates city rules and regulations or fails or neglects to pay the amount
due each month, within ten days after the delinquent date, service may be
discontinued. Prior to shutting off service, the city shall notify the
consumer in person or by mail of the intended shut-off. If the amount due is
not paid before the scheduled shut-off date, the city shall not be obligated
to give or provide any further notice prior to discontinuing the service and
shall not be liable to the consumer upon the discontinuance for non-payment
as set out in this code. Any consumer whose service has been disconnected
shall not have his or her service reinstated until the full amount of the
delinquent utilities have been paid or payment contract executed. In
addition, the consumer shall pay a service fee to be fixed by Council
resolution for failure to pay, reinstatement, and/or service connection. The
City Manager or designee may refuse service until all unpaid charges for
electric service have been paid.



   (E)   Meter tampering. Where no meter has been installed or electric
service has been discontinued by the city for any reason, no person or
persons except authorized agents of the city may reinstate said service.
Costs incurred to remedy meter tampering shall be set by Council resolution
as stated in § 51.02(B).



   (F)   Liens. All unpaid charges shall be a lien in favor of the city
upon each lot or parcel of land or other property served and shall be
collected as other liens of the city are enforced.



   (G)   Advance payment. Before electric service is furnished to any
residence, store, warehouse, or commercial or industrial enterprise, the City
Manager or designee may require an advance payment as follows.



      (1)   Residence. In a sum sufficient to compensate the city in
the estimated amount of the first two months’ charges or single largest
month, whichever is less for electric services.



      (2)   Store, warehouse, or commercial or industrial
enterprise. In a sum sufficient to compensate the city in the estimated
amount of the first month’s charges for electric services.



      (3)   The advance payment will be held for one year. If there
are no delinquencies on the account, the advance payment will be refunded. If
there are credit problems with the account after one year, the advance
payment will be held until the customer has 12 consecutive months without a
delinquency. In the event full payment is not received and service is
disconnected, the advance payment will be applied to the final charge.

STREETLIGHT FEE




§ 51.15  STREETLIGHT FEE ESTABLISHED.



   A streetlight fee (SLF) is hereby created and imposed on consumers of
the city’s electric utility, the amount of which is to be set by Council
resolution. The revenue from the SLF shall be used to pay direct and indirect
costs associated with the operation, maintenance, installation, and
replacement of street lighting owned, operated, or controlled by the city.
The SLF is premised on both the direct and indirect use of or benefit from
provision and use of the city’s street lighting and is neither a property
tax nor subject to the limitations of Article XI, § 11 of the State
Constitution.



(Prior Code, § 4.300)  (Ord. 2013-08, passed 8-13-2013)



§ 51.16  DEDICATED ACCOUNT.



   All revenues generated by the SLF shall be placed in a dedicated
account within the city’s Street Fund and used only to pay the direct and
indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance, installation, and
replacement of street lighting owned, operated, or controlled by the city.



(Prior Code, § 4.310)  (Ord. 2013-08, passed 8-13-2013)



§ 51.17  BILLING.



   The SLF shall be billed to and collected from the person identified for
each metered site in the city’s electric utility records as responsible for
payment of electric energy charges. Streetlight fee billings will be
separately identified on any utility billing statement and will be due and
payable on the same schedule as that set for the electric utility. Payments
on the utility billing statement shall be applied in a priority consistent
with that set up in § 34.04. Failure to pay the SLF when due subjects the
metered site to discontinuance of electric utility service consistent with
the terms of §§ 34.04 and 51.03(D).

RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT




§ 73.035  PURPOSE.



   A residential parking permit system is established so motor vehicles
bearing a valid residential parking permit may be parked on city streets in
excess of the time limits on specific street sections within designated
areas. A permit confers no rights upon the holder, but rather is a privilege
providing exemption from the time limitations and is subject to revocation at
any time in the discretion of the city.



(Prior Code, § 6.405)



§ 73.036  TEMPORARY DESIGNATIONS OF ON-STREET PARKING PERMIT AREAS AND

issue a residential parking permit to the owner or operator of the vehicle
residing in the designated area.

designated area. Permit is valid for one year from date of issuance.



   (C)   A residential parking permit must be displayed on the upper
left windshield of the vehicle while the vehicle is parked in the designated
area.



   (D)   Vehicles with a properly displayed residential parking permit
may park in the designated area in excess of the posted time limits.



   (E)   A residential parking permit neither guarantees nor reserves a
parking space.



   (F)   A residential parking permit does not exempt holders from
other parking, abandonment, towing, or immobilization regulations and
penalties.



   (G)   Unauthorized use of a residential parking permit subjects the
holder to permit revocation.



   (H)   It is a violation of the residential parking permit program
for any person to copy, reproduce, or sell a residential parking permit.



(Prior Code, § 6.415)  Penalty, see § 73.999

from the applicant verifying eligibility. Permit holders shall contact the
city regarding change of residence or disposition of a permitted vehicle.

IMPOUNDING VEHICLES




§ 73.055  IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.



   (A)   When a vehicle is placed in a manner or location which an
Enforcement Officer reasonably believes constitutes an obstruction to traffic
or hazard, the Officer may order the owner or operator thereof to move the
vehicle. If the vehicle is unattended, the Officer may cause the vehicle to
be towed and stored at the owner’s expense.



   (B)   The towing, impoundment, and/or storage of vehicles under this
section shall be done consistent with §§ 74.01 and 74.02 and the statutory

issuance of a citation for violation of any provision of this code.

may impound or immobilize the vehicle. An impounded or immobilized vehicle
shall not be released until all outstanding fines and charges have been paid.

justified. The request must be delivered to the Municipal Court after the
affixing of the pre-tow notice and prior to the towing of the vehicle or
trailer. The Municipal Court shall set a time for the hearing within 72 hours
of receipt of the request filed pursuant to this section, excluding holidays,

      (2)   Valid, the Court shall order the vehicle or trailer to
be held in custody until the costs of the hearing, administrative fees,
outstanding parking tickets, towing, and storage costs are paid by the owner
or person claiming the vehicle. If the vehicle has not yet been towed, the
city shall order that the vehicle or trailer be towed if the code violation
involving the vehicle or trailer has not been corrected.

another hearing unless the person provides satisfactory reasons to the
Municipal Court for the person’s failure to appear.

proposed or actual vehicle or trailer custody and/or tow.

reasonableness of the charge for towing and storage of the vehicle or
trailer. If the vehicle or trailer is towed by city equipment and personnel,
the charges shall be fixed by Council resolution. Any private company that
tows and stores any vehicle or trailer pursuant to §§ 74.02 or 74.04 shall
have a lien on the vehicle or trailer, in accordance with O.R.S. 87.152
(2013), for the just and reasonable charges for the tow and storage services

the holder of the variance permit. This letter shall provide the reason why
the variance is revoked or modified and advise the permit holder of his or
her right to an appeal pursuant to § 10.18.

notice or the ability to proceed toward abatement.

citation or complaint be served on the person-in-charge and/or owner, if

nuisance is likely to be present at the time of the requested abatement; and



      (4)   If the city is seeking a civil penalty, the amount
thereof is reasonable and justified by the circumstances.



   (F)   Upon its determination that the city has carried its burden,
the Municipal Court is authorized to issue a written order:



      (1)   Authorizing the city to enter the property where the
nuisance is located and abate said nuisance;



      (2)   Imposing a civil penalty on the person-in-charge or

appropriate given the nature of the nuisance and its effects on the adjoining
properties and the city.



   (G)   A copy of the order shall be mailed to the person-in-charge
and/or owner, if different, by the Municipal Court to the address where the
citation or complaint was served.



   (H)   Once the city obtains a Municipal Court order to abate the
nuisance and/or take other actions to address the nuisance and proceeds to
act thereon, the Enforcement Officer shall cause an accounting to be kept of
all costs, charges, fees, and penalties associated therewith.



   (I)   The Enforcement Officer shall send a notice and a copy of the
accounting statement by certified mail to the person-in-charge and/or owner,
if different, within 30 days of the calculation described in division (H)

penalties associated therewith are not paid in full to the city within 30
days of the mailing date of the notice, any unpaid costs, charges, fees, and
penalties will be made an assessment lien against the property; and



      (3)   A statement that the person-in-charge and/or owner may
challenge the reasonableness or justification of any cost, charge, or fee by
filing a written petition with the Municipal Court within ten days of the
mailing date of the notice, succinctly setting out the basis for the belief
that the cost, charge, or fee is either unreasonable or otherwise unjustified.



   (K)   In the event the person-in-charge and/or owner fails to timely
challenge the notice and 30 days has lapsed, any unpaid costs, charges, fees,
and penalties shall be filed in the city’s lien docket as an assessment
lien and thereafter enforced and collected, bearing interest at the legal
rate from the day of entry on the docket until fully paid.



   (L)   The person-in-charge and/or owner may challenge the
reasonableness or justification of any cost, charge, or fee imposed as a
result of the abatement by filing a written petition with the Municipal Court
within ten days of the mailing date of the notice described in division (J)
above and request a hearing to show cause why the cost, charge, or fee is
either unreasonable or otherwise unjustified.

nuisance, the Enforcement Officer or other appropriate city official is
authorized to immediately enter said property and cause the summary abatement
thereof.



   (B)   In the event the Enforcement Officer or other city official

CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES




§ 91.065  CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES.



   This subchapter shall be know and may be cited as the “Chronic
Nuisance Properties Ordinance” and may be referred to herein as “this
subchapter”. The City Council finds that:



   (A)   By virtue of its authority to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the community, the city has the power to abate a public nuisance
by way of an injunctive decree or order and to impose a penalty upon the
person responsible for creating or maintaining a public nuisance;



   (B)   The abatement of a single nuisance is ineffective in
protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the community at large when
conditions or activities related to the use of properties give rise to a
series of public nuisances over time;



   (C)   A process and means to hold property owners accountable for
adverse conditions and activities that repeatedly occur in connection with
his or her property is needed to help maintain and improve the quality of
life in the city; and



   (D)   Pursuant to the city’s regulatory authority to help maintain
and improve the quality of life in the city, this subchapter is enacted to
establish the rights, duties, and procedures necessary to hold property
owners and persons in charge of property accountable for adverse conditions
and activities that repeatedly occur in connection with his or her property.

      (5)   A statement that the failure of a person in charge of
the properties to promptly meet, discuss, and devise a plan to prevent or

the city is delaying commencement of an action related to the chronic
nuisance, no new nuisance activity occurs at or near the properties. However,

GENERAL PROVISIONS




§ 110.001  SHORT TITLE.



   The provisions of this subchapter create the terms of the “Forest
Grove Business License Code” and is referred to herein as “Business

(Prior Code, § 7.000)  (Ord. 2008-01, passed 3-31-2008)



§ 110.002  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.



   (A)   The Business License Code facilitates the collection of
information about businesses in the city. Emergency responders from the
Police and Fire Departments are better able to respond effectively and safely
to emergency situations at city businesses when they have information about
types of businesses and the contents of the structures in the city. Building
Code compliance, Planning Code compliance, Fire Code compliance, and
Wastewater discharge compliance are enhanced by obtaining data from business
license applications about structures in which businesses are located.
Business demographic information is also necessary to promote economic
development. The Business License Code is designed to obtain that
information. The public health, safety, and welfare are benefitted by this
Business Licensing Code.



   (B)   The annual business license fee imposed by the Business
License Code is for revenue purposes only for municipal purposes and for the
privilege of doing business in the city. The fees imposed shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other license or permit fee(s),
charge(s) or tax(es) required under any other code section or ordinance of
the city or county or any state or federal law.



   (C)   The annual business license required by the BLC shall not be
construed to constitute a permit to engage in any activity prohibited by law
nor a waiver of any regulatory or license requirement imposed by other
provision(s) of city, federal, state, regional, or local law.



(Prior Code, § 7.005)  (Ord. 2008-01, passed 3-31-2008)

obtained through illegal means.

the fence or walls as provided in this code.



   (C)   The Building Inspector may approve modifications to the
height, nature, or location of the fence, wall, gates, or latches, provided
the protection as sought under this code is not reduced. The Building
Inspector may permit other protective devices or structures to be used so
long as the degree of protection afforded by the substitute devices or
structures is not less than the protection afforded by the wall, fence, gate,
and latch described in this code. The Building Department shall allow 30
days’ notice within which to comply with the requirements of this section.
Notice to comply with the provisions of this code shall be in writing and
given by certified mail.



   (D)   In the case of existing pools or structures, the Building
Inspector may grant a variance from the provisions of this code as to the
height of the fence or setback requirements; however, the protective devices
and safeguards installed must comply with the safety precautions intended to
be provided by this code.



   (E)   Hot tubs may use a secured cover instead of a fence.

apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   BUILDING PERMIT. Any permit issued by the Building Department for the
installation or construction of a residential structure (such as

   PARKING ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT. Purchase or lease of property for
park purposes and all design and construction associated with the development
or improvement of any park, including any equipment and development labor.

§ 151.027  CHARGE IMPOSED.



   A system development charge for park acquisition and development is
hereby imposed upon all new dwelling units developed within the city. Such
charge shall be established by the City Council under separate resolution.
This fee is not covered by the annual fee adjustment.



(Prior Code, § 3.510)  (Ord. 1990-07, passed 9-23-2007; Ord. 2012-01,
passed 2-13-2012)



§ 151.028  COLLECTION.



   (A)   A system development charge for park acquisition and
development shall be paid prior to receiving a building permit or
manufactured dwelling setup fee. If the project is a residential or
multi-family dwelling, an application may be made to the city to pay the
parks system development charge in installment payments for a period not to
exceed ten years. Fifteen percent of the system development charge due shall
be paid upon application submission. The terms of the financing arrangement
shall be set by Council resolution.



   (B)   An applicant for installment payments must demonstrate the
applicant’s authority to assent to the imposition of a lien on the property
and that the interest of the applicant is adequate to secure payment of the
lien.



   (C)   From that time the City Manager or designee has docketed a
lien as provided in § 32.01 upon the described property for the amount of
the system development charge, together with interest on the unpaid balance,
the lien may be collected in the same manner as allowed by law for collection
of assessment liens.



   (D)   The City Manager or designee is authorized to administer all
aspects of the installment payment and financing of system development
charges. This authority includes, but is not limited to:



      (1)   Providing final approval for projects seeking to
participate in the installment payment and financing program;



      (2)   Providing application forms for installment payments
that include a waiver of all rights to contest the validity of the lien,
except for the correction of computational errors;



      (3)   Documenting the amount of the system development charge,
the dates on which the payments are due, the name of the owner, and the
description of the property; and



      (4)   Entering a lien for the amount of the system development
charge, together with interest on the unpaid balance, in the city’s lien
docket as provided in § 32.01.



(Prior Code, § 3.515)  (Ord. 1990-07, passed 9-23-2007; Ord. 2012-01,
passed 2-13-2012)



§ 151.029  REDUCED CHARGES.



   (A)   A developer may apply for a reduction of the system
development charge by dedicating land or facilities to the city.



   (B)   City acceptance of the land or facilities in lieu of all or
part of the assessed charge is based on the following criteria:



      (1)   The land offered can be used for park purposes in a
manner consistent with the park and recreation element of the city’s
Comprehensive Plan and any park or recreation plan or program adopted
pursuant thereto, or can be sold by the city to obtain funds for such
purposes;



      (2)   The land is adequate in size, location, and topography
for the facilities necessary to satisfy the needs of the new residents;



      (3)   The land will at all times be available and accessible
to the general public in accordance with existing ordinances and regulations
dealing with the use of public facilities;



      (4)   The city’s Parks and Recreation Commission approves
the location and construction of all improvements on the land; and



      (5)   The amount of fee reduction is based on the city’s
Comprehensive Plan park standards considering amount of land and cost of
facilities dedicated to the city, number of dwellings or population served,
and the like. Meeting neighborhood park standards for the proposed
residential population may reduce fees up to one-half. Meeting neighborhood
and community park standards may eliminate park system development charges.



   (C)   In the event land is dedicated in lieu of the systems
developments charge, an equal portion of the value of the land dedicated
shall be apportioned to each of the lots created. As the building permits are
issued and the systems charge collected for each lot, the value of the
dedicated land apportioned to each lot shall be credited, without interest,
to the person dedicating the land, or his or her heirs, or his or her
assigns, until the total value is credited or five years have elapsed from
the date building permits are made available from the city. In the event the
total amount has not been credited within five years or before the

abandon the improvement.



(Prior Code, § 3.410)



§ 151.082  RESOLUTION DECLARING INTENTION.



   If the Council approves the Engineer’s report as submitted or
modified, the Council shall, by resolution, declare its intention to make the
improvement, provide the manner and method of carrying out the improvement,
and direct the City Recorder to give notice of the improvement by one
publication not less than 20 days prior to the public hearing in a newspaper

registered or certified mail to the owners expected to be assessed for the
costs of the improvement.



(Prior Code, § 3.415)



§ 151.083  CONTENTS OF NOTICE.



   The notice described in § 151.082 shall contain the following:

the City Engineer and is subject to public examination;



   (B)   The Council will hold a public hearing on the proposed
improvement on a specified date, which shall not be earlier than 20 days
following the first publication of notice, at which objections and
remonstrances to the improvement, unless it is a sidewalk or emergency

workday preceding the hearing date there is presented to the City Recorder
valid written remonstrances of the owners of two-thirds of the land to be

(Prior Code, § 3.425)



§ 151.085  HEARING.



   At the time of the public hearing on the proposed improvement, if the
written remonstrances represent less than the amount of property required to
suspend the proposed improvement, then, on the basis of the hearing or
written remonstrances and oral objections, if any, the Council may, by
resolution at the time of the hearing or within 60 days thereafter, order the

§ 151.086  CALL FOR BIDS.



   The Council may direct the City Recorder to advertise for bids for
construction of all or part of the improvement project. However, no contract
shall be let until after the public hearing has been held to hear
remonstrances and oral objections to the proposed improvement. If part of the
improvement work is to be done under contract bids, the Council shall proceed
in accordance with city and state law for public contracting. If the Council
finds, upon opening bids for the work of the improvement, that the lowest
responsible bid is substantially in excess of the Engineer’s estimate, it
may provide for holding a special hearing of objections to proceeding with
the improvement on the basis of the bid and may direct the City Recorder to
publish one notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.



(Prior Code, § 3.435)



§ 151.087  ASSESSMENT ORDINANCE.



   (A)   If the Council determines the public improvement shall be
made, when the estimated cost is determined on the basis of the contract
award or city departmental cost or after the work is done and the cost has
been actually determined, the Council shall decide whether the benefitted
property shall bear all or a portion of the cost. The City Recorder or other
person designated by the Council shall prepare the proposed assessment for
each lot within the assessment district and file the assessments in the
appropriate city office.



   (B)   Notice of the proposed assessment shall be mailed or
personally delivered to the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed. The
notice shall state the amount of assessment proposed on the property and fix
a date by which time objections shall be filed with the City Recorder. An
objection shall state the grounds for the objection.



   (C)   At the hearing, the Council shall:



      (1)   Consider objections and may adopt, correct, modify, or
revise the assessment against each lot in the district according to special
and peculiar benefits accruing to it from the improvement; and

improvement, may:



      (1)   Use any just and reasonable method of determining the
extent of any improvement district consistent with the benefits derived;



      (2)   Use any method of apportioning the same to be assessed
as is just and reasonable between the properties determined to be specially
benefitted; or



      (3)   Authorize payment by the city of all or part of the cost
of an improvement when, in the opinion of the Council, the topographical or
physical conditions, unusual or excessive public travel, or other character
of the work warrants only partial payment or no payment of the cost by owners
of benefitted properties.



   (B)   Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the Council
from using other means of financing improvements, including federal or state
grants-in-aid, sewer charges or fees, revenue bonds, general obligation
bonds, or any other legal means of finance. If other means of finance are
used, the Council may levy special assessments according to benefits derived
to cover any remaining cost.



(Prior Code, § 3.445)



§ 151.089  NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT.



   (A)   Within ten days after the ordinance levying assessments has

assessment ordinance.



   (B)   The notice of assessment shall include the name of the
property owner, a description of the assessed property, the amount of the
assessment and the date of the assessment ordinance, and shall state that
interest will begin to run on the assessment and the property will be subject
to foreclosure unless the owner either makes application to pay the
assessment in installments within ten days after the date of the publication
of notice or pays the assessment in full within 30 days after the date of the
assessment ordinance.



(Prior Code, § 3.450)



§ 151.090  LIEN RECORD AND FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS.

shall enter into the docket of liens a statement of the amount assessed on
each lot, parcel of land, or portion of land, a description of the

ordinance. On entry into the lien docket, the amounts shall become liens and
charges on the lots, parcels of land, or portions of land that have been

all other liens or encumbrances on property insofar as state law permits.

provided by the general law of the state.



   (D)   The city may enter a bid on property being offered at a

§ 151.092  SUPPLEMENTAL ASSESSMENT.



   (A)   If an assessment is made before the total cost of the
improvement is ascertained, and if the amount of the assessment is
insufficient to defray expenses of the improvement, the Council may declare
the insufficiency by motion and prepare a proposed supplemental assessment.
The Council shall set a time for hearing objections to the supplemental
assessment and direct the City Recorder to publish one notice of the hearing
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.



   (B)   After the hearing, the Council shall make a just and equitable
supplemental assessment by ordinance, which shall be entered in the docket of
city liens as provided by § 151.090.



   (C)   Notice of the supplemental assessment shall be published and
mailed, and collection of the assessment shall be made, in accordance with
§§ 151.090 and 151.091.



(Prior Code, § 3.465)



§ 151.093  REBATES.



   (A)   On completion of the improvement project, if the assessment
previously levied on any property is found to be more than sufficient to pay
the cost of the improvement, the Council shall determine the excess and
declare it by ordinance. When declared, the excess amounts shall be entered
in the lien docket as a credit on the appropriate assessment.



   (B)   If an assessment has been paid, the person who paid it or that
person’s legal representative shall be entitled to payment of the rebate
credit.

of property as required by this subchapter; or



      (4)   Any other error, mistake, delay, omission, irregularity,

specified, unless it appears that the assessment is unfair or unjust in its
effect on the person complaining.



   (B)   The Council shall have authority to remedy and correct all
matters by suitable action and proceedings.



(Prior Code, § 3.485)



§ 151.097  REASSESSMENT.



   When an assessment, supplemental assessment, or reassessment for an
improvement made by the city has been set aside, annulled, declared, or
rendered void, or its enforcement restrained by a court of this state or by a
federal court having jurisdiction, or when the Council doubts the validity of
the assessment, supplemental assessment, reassessment, or any part of it, the
Council may make a reassessment in the manner provided by state law.



(Prior Code, § 3.490)



§ 151.098  APPORTIONMENT OF LIENS.



   (A)   When a portion of a single tract or parcel of real property is
partitioned or divided in accordance with applicable land use laws, or when
the ownership of a portion of a single tract of real property less than the
entire tract is transferred or a portion is conveyed by a long-term lease
that is at least ten years in duration, a lien against the real property in
favor of the city shall be apportioned upon compliance with the terms of this
section.



   (B)   Applications for the apportionment of liens shall be made to
the City Recorder describing the tract to be segregated. The application must
be completed by the owner, mortgagee, lienholder, or tenant having an
interest in the parcel. When the deed, mortgage, or other instrument
evidencing the applicant’s ownership or other interest in the parcel has
not been recorded by the County Clerk of the county in which the parcel is
situated, the city shall not apportion the special assessment unless the
applicant files a true copy of that deed, mortgage, or instrument with the
city.



   (C)   The City Recorder shall compute the apportionment whenever the
special assessment remains wholly or partially unpaid and full payment or an
installment payment is not due. The apportionment shall be calculated on the
same basis as it was originally computed. The apportionment shall not be made
unless each part of the original tract of land, after the apportionment, has
a true cash value, as determined from a certificate of the County Assessor or
appraisal of a qualified appraiser, of 120% or more of the amount of the lien
as applied to each tract apportioned. The valuation must be determined within
one year prior to the date of the application.



   (D)   When a special assessment is being paid in installments and a
request to apportion is authorized, the remaining installments not yet due
shall be prorated among the smaller parcels so that each parcel shall be
charged with that percentage of the remaining installment payments equal to
the percentage of the unpaid assessment charged to the parcel upon
apportionment.



   (E)   Apportionment of a special assessment under this section shall
be done in accordance with a resolution of the Council. The resolution shall
describe each parcel of real property affected by the apportionment, the
amount of the assessment levied against each parcel, the owner of each
parcel, and such additional information as is required to keep a permanent
and complete record of the assessments and payments.



   (F)   An application shall not be processed until the applicant pays
a fee to defray the costs of evaluating the application. The amount of the
fee shall be set by Council resolution.

(Prior Code, § 3.10.015)  (Ord. 2011-02, passed 1-24-2011)



§ 151.113  CITY ENGINEER’S REPORT.



   The City Engineer shall review the application and other material
submitted therewith and prepare a written report for the Council which will

property owned by the applicant;



   (B)   The area proposed to be included in the Reimbursement District;



   (C)   The actual or estimated cost of the improvements within the
area of the proposed Reimbursement District and the portion thereof for which
the applicant should be reimbursed;



   (D)   A methodology for allocating the cost among the parcels within
the proposed district and, where appropriate, defining a “unit” for
applying the reimbursement fee to property which may be partitioned,
subdivided, or otherwise modified at some future date. The methodology should
include consideration of the cost of the improvement(s), prior contributions
by property owners, the value of the unused capacity, rate-making principles
associated with the financing of public improvements, and such other factors
as deemed relevant by the City Engineer;



   (E)   The amount to be charged by the city for administering the
agreement, to be fixed by City Council and included in the resolution

   (F)   The period of time that the right to reimbursement exists if
that period is less than ten years; and



   (G)   Whether the street, water, and sewer improvements will meet or
have met city standards.



(Prior Code, § 3.10.020)  (Ord. 2011-02, passed 1-24-2011)

following:



      (1)   The costs of construction;



      (2)   Engineering (including surveying and inspection) costs
in an amount not to exceed 15% of the construction costs;

reasonable market value of land or easements purchased by the applicant from
third parties to complete off-site improvements;



      (4)   Financing costs associated with the improvement to the
extent the financing costs are not attributable to the applicant’s property
or project; and



      (5)   Legal and other expenses incurred by the applicant to
the extent said expenses relate to the preparation and filing of the
application, the preparation of the report required by § 151.113, and the
hearing process set out in §§ 151.115 and 151.116.



   (B)   Regardless of amount or category, costs reimbursable or
eligible for traffic impact fee credits or systems development charge credits
which cannot be clearly documented or which are attributable to the
applicant’s property or project are not reimbursable.



   (C)   By submitting an application that seeks reimbursement of legal
expenses, the applicant thereby waives any attorney/client or attorney work
product privilege that may exist in attorney billing statements or records in
support thereof.



   (D)   A reimbursement fee shall be determined for all properties
which fall within the proposed Reimbursement District, including

reimbursement fee computed for property owned by the city or other
governmental body.

§ 151.115  PUBLIC HEARING.



   (A)   Within a reasonable time after the City Engineer has completed
the report required in § 151.113, the City Council shall hold an
informational public hearing in which persons impacted by the creation of the
Reimbursement District shall be given the opportunity to comment thereon.



   (B)   Notice of the hearing shall be given not less than ten nor
more than 30 days prior to the public hearing date. Notice shall be given to
the applicant and all owners of property within the proposed District with
notification by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal
service. Notice shall be deemed complete as of the date notice is mailed or
served. Failure to receive actual notice of the hearing shall not invalidate
or otherwise affect any action of the city relative to the creation of the
Reimbursement District and/or the costs associated therewith.



   (C)   Formation of a District does not result in an assessment or
lien against property. As a result, the hearing is informational only and the
District is not subject to termination as a result of remonstrances to the
formation thereof. The City Council has the sole discretion, after the public
hearing, to decide whether the District is to be formed or not. If a District
is to be formed, a resolution approving and forming the Reimbursement
District shall be adopted.



   (D)   If a Reimbursement District is formed prior to construction of
the improvement(s), a second public hearing shall be held after the
improvement has been accepted by the city when the Council may modify the
resolution to reflect the cost of the improvement(s).

   At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council shall approve,
reject, or modify the recommendations contained in the City Engineer’s
report and manifest its action in a resolution. If a Reimbursement District
is established, the resolution shall include a copy of the City Engineer’s
report as approved or modified and specify that payment of the appropriate
fee as determined by the Council for each parcel is a precondition to receipt
of any city permit necessary for development of that parcel. If a
Reimbursement District is established, it shall be deemed formed as of the
date the Council adopts the resolution referred to in § 151.115.



(Prior Code, § 3.10.035)  (Ord. 2011-02, passed 1-24-2011)



§ 151.117  REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT.



   (A)   If the Council approves the City Engineer’s Report and
thereafter creates a District, the City Manager shall cause the creation of
an agreement between the applicant and city containing (at a minimum)
provisions relating to the following:



      (1)   The public improvement(s) will or do meet all applicable
city standards;



      (2)   The amount of the potential reimbursement the applicant
can expect along with a caveat that the total amount of any reimbursement
will not exceed the actual cost of the public improvement(s);



      (3)   The annual fee adjustment, if any;



      (4)   The applicant will guarantee the quality of the public
improvement(s) for a period of not less than 12 months after the date of
their installation;



      (5)   The applicant will defend, indemnify, and hold the city
harmless from any and all losses, claims, damage, judgments, or other costs
or expense arising as a result of or related to the city’s establishment of
the District; and



      (6)   The applicant acknowledges the city is not obligated to
collect the reimbursement fee from affected property owners.



   (B)   The city may include other provisions as the City Council
determines necessary to ensure compliance with this subchapter.



(Prior Code, § 3.10.040)  (Ord. 2011-02, passed 1-24-2011)



§ 151.118  ANNUAL FEE ADJUSTMENT.



   The City Council may, in its discretion, grant an annual adjustment to
the amounts established as the reimbursement fee at the time of the hearing
on the Engineer’s report. In the event such an adjustment is deemed
appropriate, it shall be applicable to the fee beginning on the first
anniversary of the date of the Council’s approval of the application, be
fixed and computed against the reimbursement fee as simple interest, and
remain the same for each year the District exists.



(Prior Code, § 3.10.045)  (Ord. 2011-02, passed 1-24-2011)

explanation of when the property owner is obligated to pay the reimbursement
fee and the amount thereof.

§ 151.120  RECORDING THE RESOLUTION.



   The City Recorder shall cause notice of the formation and nature of the
Reimbursement District to be filed in the office of the County Recorder in
order to provide notice to potential purchasers of property within the
District of its existence. Failure to make such recording shall affect
neither the legality of the resolution nor the obligation to pay any fee.

the application consistent with the terms of O.R.S. 34.010 through 34.100
(writ of review).

   (A)   A person applying for a permit related to property within a
Reimbursement District shall pay to the city, in addition to all other
applicable fees and charges, the reimbursement fee established by the City
Council under the terms of this subchapter if, within the time specified in
the resolution establishing the District, the person applies for and receives
approval from the city for any of the following activities:



      (1)   A building permit for a new building or a permit for an
addition, modification, repair, or alteration to an existing building
exceeding 25% of the value thereof within any 12-month period (not due to
damage or destruction of the building by fire or natural disaster). VALUE as
used above means the amount shown on the County’s Department of Assessment
and Taxation for the building’s real market value;



      (2)   Any alteration, modification, or change in the use of
real property, which increases the number of parking spaces required under

      (3)   Connection to or use of a water, sanitary sewer, storm
water, or street improvement, if the District is based on that improvement.



   (B)   The obligation to pay the reimbursement fee arises and accrues
as of the time property within the District utilizes the affected public
improvement regardless of whether a person applies for and/or receives a
permit connected with that utilization.



   (C)   The City Council’s determination of which properties shall
be liable for payment of the fee is final. Neither the city nor any officer
or employee of the city shall be liable for payment of any reimbursement fee
or portion thereof as a result of this determination.



   (D)   A permit applicant whose property is subject to payment of a
reimbursement fee receives a benefit from the construction of street
improvements, regardless of whether access is taken or provided directly onto
such street at any time. Nothing in this subchapter is intended to modify or
limit the authority of the city to provide or require access management.



   (E)   No person shall be required to pay the reimbursement fee on an
application or upon property for which the reimbursement fee has been
previously paid, unless such payment was for a different type of improvement.



   (F)   The right to reimbursement shall not extend beyond ten years
from the District’s formation date, subject to renewal at the option of the
Council for one additional ten-year period.

agreement is in effect. Such payments shall be made by the city within 90
days of receipt of the reimbursements monies.

protection of public health and safety. The provisions are intended to
mitigate the adverse impacts of manufactured dwelling closures on park
residents by ensuring: that the closure is preceded by adequate notice; that

   (B)   Should the owner provide evidence demonstrating to the city
that two-thirds of the tenants have executed such agreements, and that the
balance of tenants have been offered comparable agreement terms, the
provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the closure involving all
tenants. Such evidence may include an agreement with or a sale to a tenant
association or tenant nonprofit corporation representing two-thirds or more
of the tenants.



(Prior Code, § 5.330)



§ 152.06  REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS.



   (A)   In the event the owner intends to sell the manufactured
dwelling park, the owner shall notify, in writing, the tenants and the city
within ten days of receipt of any written offer received by the owner or
agent of the owner to purchase the park which the owner intends to consider

manufactured dwelling park.



   (D)   Upon delivery of the notice required herein, the owner shall
negotiate in good faith with the tenant or organization and provide the
tenant or organization an opportunity to purchase the facility as the owner
would any bona fide third party potential purchaser.

described in O.R.S. 90.820(4) or to any offeror listing agreement made before
this section was adopted.



(Prior Code, § 5.335)



§ 152.07  REQUIRED FINDINGS.



   In approving a permit for a manufactured dwelling park closure, the
City Council shall find that the proposed closure meets the following
requirements in addition to the other requirements of this chapter:



   (A)   The tenants of the manufactured dwelling park have been
adequately notified of the proposed closure, including information pertaining
to the anticipated timing of the proposed closure;



   (B)   The age, type, size, and style of manufactured dwelling to be
displaced as a result of the closure will be able to be relocated into other
comparable manufactured dwelling parks within a 25-mile radius of the city,
or that the owner has agreed to purchase any manufactured dwelling that
cannot be relocated at its in-place value as provided for in this chapter;



   (C)   Any manufactured dwelling tenants displaced as a result of the
closure shall be compensated by the owner for all reasonable relocation
costs, excluding the value of tax credits owing the tenant under state law;
and



   (D)   If the owner files a tentative plat or plan for a land
division to be created from the closure of a rental manufactured dwelling
park, the owner provides tenants such offers and other information required
by law.



(Prior Code, § 5.340)  (Ord. 2007-22, passed 12-10-2007)



§ 152.08  CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.



   The City Council may impose any necessary and appropriate conditions of
approval to satisfy and implement the intent, purpose, and content of this
chapter. In addition, any other necessary and appropriate conditions of
approval to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
city may be imposed. The Council shall not deny, but may approve or
conditionally approve, the permit involving the closure of the park or
cessation of the use of the land as a manufactured dwelling park, provided
the applicant has properly complied with the requirements of this chapter and
there is no evidence that the applicant or prior owners have attempted to
evict or otherwise cause the removal of residents for the purpose of avoiding
the requirements of this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 5.345)



§ 152.09  OWNER RELIEF.



   (A)   The owner of a manufactured dwelling park may apply for relief
from the requirements of this chapter. Compliance with the terms of this
chapter shall not be a precondition to such application. Upon receipt of an
owners application for relief setting forth facts demonstrating how
application of the chapter is unduly oppressive under the circumstances then
and there existing, together with an application filing fee in an amount
established by City Council, the City Manager shall make a recommendation to
the City Council, and based upon the record of a public hearing in accordance
with Council rules for conduct of administrative and quasi-judicial hearings,
the City Council shall determine the extent to which application of this
chapter, or portions thereof, is unduly oppressive.



   (B)   In making that determination, the Council shall consider the
amount and percentage of value loss, the extent of remaining uses, past,
present, and future, the seriousness of the public problem caused by the
owner’s acts of closure, the degree to which these provisions mitigate the
problem and the feasibility of less oppressive solutions. The Council shall
consider other factors as may be relevant or necessary to achieve a lawful
application of these provisions. The Council shall make written findings,
supported by substantial evidence, of the extent to which application of
these provisions are unduly oppressive, and articulate those requirements or
payments that the owner need not bear to avoid such oppression. As to these
requirements or payments, the owner shall be relieved. As to the remaining
owner obligations, the Council shall, considering the record of the
proceedings, the unmitigated impacts upon the tenants, and the intent and
purpose of this chapter, declare the manner in which such obligations shall
appear in the relocation plan or other conditions of the manufactured
dwelling park closure permit.



   (C)   Appeal of Council action under this section shall be by writ
of review or other appropriate procedure.



(Prior Code, § 5.350)



§ 152.10  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Private right of action. Except with respect to relief granted
by the City Council under the provisions of §§ 152.05(A)(3) or 152.09 any
tenant of a manufactured dwelling park, or any owner of a manufactured
dwelling in a park subject to closure shall have a right of action in a court
of competent jurisdiction for such equitable and legal remedies as the court
may grant, and shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees,
expenses, costs, and other disbursements reasonably incurred.



   (B)   Cumulative remedies. The foregoing is in addition to any other
remedies that may exist at law or in equity.



(Prior Code, § 5.355)



§ 152.11  RULE MAKING AUTHORITY.



   The City Manager or designee is authorized to promulgate any rules
necessary for the implementation of this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 5.360)



§ 152.99  PENALTY.



   Any person who closes a manufactured dwelling park without a permit,
who fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the conditions
of the permit, or who willfully makes an untrue or misleading statement of
material fact or willfully omits to provide required information in the
process of application or whose actions, through the raising of rent or
otherwise, objectively manifests an intent or effort to avoid the
requirements to this chapter, shall be guilty of a violation. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this code, the penalty for any such violation shall be
$1,000. Each day of noncompliance shall constitute a separate violation.

§ 154.02  EROSION CONTROL PLAN.



   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



      EROSION CONTROL PLAN. A plan containing a list of best management
practices to be applied during construction to control and limit soil erosion.



      LAND DEVELOPMENT. Refers to any human-induced change to improved
or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, construction,
installation, or expansion of a building or other structure, land division,
drilling, site alteration such as that due to land surface mining, dredging,
grading, construction of earthen berms, paving, improvements for use as
parking or storage, excavation, or clearing.



      PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. Any land development conducted or financed
by a local, state, or federal governmental body.



(Prior Code, § 9.805)



   (B)   Erosion Control Plan.



      (1)   The following divisions shall apply to any new land
development within the city, except those developments with application dates
prior to January 1, 1990. The application date shall be the date on which a
complete application for development approval is received by the city in
accordance with the regulations of the city.



      (2)   For land development, no preliminary plat, site plan,
permit, or public works project shall be approved by the city unless the
conditions of the plat permit or plan approval includes an Erosion Control
Plan containing methods and/or interim facilities to be constructed or used
concurrently with land development and to be operated during construction to
control the discharge of sediment in the stormwater runoff.



      (3)   The Erosion Control Plan shall utilize:



         (a)   Protection techniques to control soil erosion and
sediment transport to less than one ton per acre per year as calculated using
the soil conservation service universal soil loss equation or other
equivalent methods. The Erosion Control Plan shall include temporary
sedimentation basins when, because of steep slopes or other sites specific
considerations, other on-site sediment control methods will not likely keep
the sediment transport to less than one ton per acre per year. The city may
establish additional requirements for meeting an equivalent degree of
control. Any sediment basins constructed shall be sized using one and
one-half feet minimum sediment storage depths plus two feet storage depth
above for a settlement zone. The storage capacity of the basin shall be sized
to store all of the sediment that is likely to be transported and collected
during construction while the erosion potential exists. When the erosion
potential has been removed, the sediment basin, or other sediment facilities,
can be removed and the site restored as per the final site plan. All sediment
basins shall be constructed with an emergency overflow to prevent erosion or
failure of the containment dike; or



         (b)   A soil erosion matrix derived from and consistent
with the universal soil loss equation approved by the city.

INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURES



§ 17.1.000  HOW TO USE THIS CODE.



   This Development Code (Code) is organized as a reference document and
is not intended to be read from cover to cover. Instead, it is organized so
you may look up only the parts you need. The list of articles in the table of
contents is very important, as are the section listings at the beginning of
each article. Tables and charts are used in many places to summarize
information.



   The Code is divided into nine articles, with each article containing
related information. Note that numbers 9–11 are held for future articles:



   ∙    Article 1 - Introduction and Procedures



   ∙    Article 2 - Land Use Reviews



   ∙    Article 3 - Zoning Districts



   ∙    Article 4 - Overlay Districts



   ∙    Article 5 - Special Provisions



   ∙    Article 6 - Land Divisions



   ∙    Article 7 - Miscellaneous Provisions



   ∙    Article 8 - General Development Standards



   ∙    Article 12 - Use Categories and Definitions



Article 1 provides basic information on the purpose and legal framework of
the Code and describes how land use permits are classified for review under
four different categories of procedure (Type I – Type IV). Information on
application requirements, application review, public notice, public hearings
and appeals are included in this article along with general provisions on
administering the Code.



Article 2 describes the various land use reviews and assigns decision
authority. Some reviews may be applied for at the discretion of the applicant
, such as a conditional use or adjustment request. Other reviews are
mandatory in certain situations, such as design review. Article 2 includes
the approval criteria for the land use reviews and cross-references the
applicable procedures from Article 1.



Article 3 contains the standards for the different zoning districts. The
districts are grouped into the following categories:



   ∙    Residential Zones



   ∙    Institutional Zone



   ∙    Commercial and Mixed Use Zones



   ∙    Town Center Zones



   ∙    Industrial Zones



Article 3states which uses are permitted in each district, which uses are
allowed in limited situations, which are conditional uses , and which are
prohibited. The general development standards for each district are also
included in Article 3. The development standards include requirements such as
maximum building heights and setbacks .



Article 4 contains the standards for overlay districts. Overlay districts
consist of regulations that address specific subjects that may be applicable
in a variety of areas in the city . The Code includes two overlay districts:



   ∙    Master Plan



   ∙    Planned Developments



   ∙    Mixed Use Planned Developments



Overlay districts apply in conjunction with the base zoning district and can
modify the regulations and standards of the base district. The Official
Zoning Map identifies the location of the zoning districts and overlay
districts.



Article 5 establishes the Natural Resource Areas process to protect
environmentally sensitive areas. Special provisions and standards for
historic landmarks, manufactured home parks and tree protection are also
included in this article:



   ∙   Natural Resource Areas



   ∙    Historic Landmarks



   ∙   Tree Protection



   ∙   Manufactured Dwelling Parks



   ∙    Solar Access



   ∙   Recreational Vehicle Parks



Review procedures, approval criteria and development and design standards for
special provisions are cross-referenced or included in this article.



Article 6 deals with land divisions. This article describes submittal
requirements, approval criteria and design standards for lot line adjustments
, partitions and subdivisions . Article 1 procedures for review of land
divisions are cross-referenced. Article 8 standards for public improvements
are also cross- referenced.



Article 7 contains the regulations for specific uses (such as home
occupations and accessory structures ) that may be developed in several
zoning districts. The regulations in Article 7 generally supplement the
regulations of the Article 3, Zoning Districts.



Article 8 describes the general development standards that are applicable to
all new development or intensification of existing development (including
land divisions and development on existing lots ). This article includes
standards for parking, landscaping, public improvements, signs and other
topics. The general development standards are grouped in Article 8 to provide
consolidated information and less repetition in code language.



Articles 9 – 11are held for future topics.



Article 12 describes the framework for the classification of individual uses
into broad land use categories. This article also includes definitions of
words that are not in common use or that have a specific meaning in the Code.

phases.



      2.   The final plat for a subdivision shall be recorded within
one year after the plat has been submitted to the city.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013; Ord. 2017-12,

§ 17.1.135  EXTENSION OF LAND USE PERMIT.



   The Director, at the applicant’s request, may extend a land use
permit under the Type I review process. Requests for extension must be filed
with the Director prior to the expiration date of the original approval or
subsequent extension.



   No single extension of time shall exceed a one-year period. Extensions
shall not be approved where the effect of the extension would violate any
provisions of this Code or any amendments made following the effective
expiration date. In addition, the Director may require a new application for
a permit if conditions on the site or adjacent property have changed
substantially since the original permit approval. Except for a land division,
in no instance shall the extension(s) exceed a total of two years from the
effective date of project approval. For a land division, the time extension
for a tentative map shall not exceed four years from the effective date of
project approval.

modify the original decision. A land use permit shall expire at the end of
the time extension period unless the provisions of § 17.1.130F.1. or 2. are
met or § 17.1.130G.1. for .

(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.205  CONSOLIDATED REVIEW.



   Where a proposal involves more than one application for the same
property, the applicant may submit concurrent applications. The applications
shall be consolidated for review in accordance with the highest numbered
procedure. For example, a minor adjustment (Type I) can be consolidated with
a conditional use (Type III), but it will be subject to Type III procedures.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.210  INITIATION AND WITHDRAWAL OF LAND USE APPLICATION.



   Land useapplications shall be initiated by one of the following:



   A.   Application by all the owners or all the contract purchasers of
the subject property, or any person authorized in writing to act as agent of
the owner or contract purchasers;



   B.   The City Council;



   C.   The Planning Commission;



   D.   The Community Development Director; or



   E.   Public agencies or utilities that have statutory rights of
eminent domain for projects they have the authority to construct.



   The Director may withdraw any application at the written request of the
applicant, prior to the final written decision.



   Fees for applications withdrawn at the request of the applicant shall
be refunded, less the actual costs incurred by the city in processing the
application.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.215  PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.



   The Director shall not accept a Type II, III or IV land useapplication
for processing unless the applicant or the applicant’s representative has
attended a pre-application conference, or the Director has, in his or her
discretion, signed a waiver of the pre-application conference.



   The purpose of the pre-application conference is to acquaint the
applicant with the requirements of this Code, the Comprehensive Plan and
other relevant criteria. It is designed to assist the applicant. The
applicant assumes the risk for delays or other problems caused by failure to
attend a pre-application conference. It is impossible, however, for the
pre-application conference to be an exhaustive review of all potential issues
and the conference shall not prevent the city from enforcing all applicable
regulations.



   To schedule a pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit a
completed and signed conference request form and the following information:



   A.   A short narrative describing the proposal, including at minimum:



      1.   Proposed use;



      2.   Size of buildings and/or number and types of residential
units;



      3.   Approximate building heights; and



      4.   Other information as applicable, such as:



         a.   Number of employees;



         b.   Use of hazardous materials (including general
quantity and type); and



         c.   Any known special conditions applicable to the site
or proposed development.



   B.   A conceptual site plan; and



   C.   The appropriate fee.



   The Director shall schedule the pre-application conference within seven
working days of the request. The Director shall identify and prepare a
summary of topics to be discussed and shall provide the applicant with a
written summary of the conference.



   If a complete application relating to the proposed development action
that was the subject of the pre- application conference has not been
submitted within one year of the conference, a new pre-application conference
or waiver is required.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.220  NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING.



   When the Director determines that a proposed project has the potential
to raise concerns of neighborhood or community impact, the applicant shall
initiate, attend and conduct a neighborhood meeting. The purpose of the
neighborhood meeting is to allow the neighbors and other interested parties
to become familiar with the proposal and to identify issues that may be
associated with an application. The Director shall identify the need for the
meeting within seven days after the pre-application conference is held.



   The neighborhood meeting is intended to result in an application that
is responsive to neighborhood concerns, reducing the likelihood for delays
and appeals of the application. The city expects an applicant to take the
reasonable concerns and recommendations of the neighborhood into
consideration when preparing an application. The city expects the neighbors
will work with the applicant to provide such input.



   Neighborhood meetings must be conducted before the city will accept an
application on any portion of the proposal. The applicant can request a
sign-in sheet from the Community Development Department or provide his or her
own sign-in sheet, which must be completed on the night of the neighborhood
meeting and submitted to the city at the time of application as verification
that the meeting was held. The sign-in sheet should indicate the date, time
and location of the meeting, a brief heading describing the subject of the
proposal, and the signatures of those in attendance at the meeting. The city
shall retain the sign-in sheet as part of the record in the land use case
file.



   Those notified of the neighborhood meeting shall, at minimum, include
all surrounding property owners and residents located at the notification
distance of the greatest level permit or 300 feet if the permit type is not
known, as well as any other interested parties identified by the Director .

or would increase traffic on citystreets by at least 50 peak hourly trips, or
a Transportation Impact Study is required by the Oregon Department of
Transportation. The Director may also require a transportation study for any
one project or multiple projects where there may be cumulative traffic
impacts from two or more projects affecting one or more transportation
facilities;



   E.   Duplicates of the above information as required by the
Director. (Note: The pre-application conference summary will provide guidance

solely on failure to address the development standards or supply information
required by Code and by the Director, in a pre-application conference or

notify the Community Development Department of any changes or to request any
renewal to continue inclusion on the notification list.



   D.   While it is the intent of the Community Development Department

REVIEW PROCESS AND PROCEDURES



§ 17.1.300  OVERVIEW OF REVIEW TYPES.



   The City of Forest Grove classifies land use permit reviews into one of
four procedure types (Types I, II, III and IV). The procedures vary according
to the level of discretion involved in making the decision, the extent to
which the public may become involved in the decision-making process, and the
opportunity to appeal a decision to a local review authority.



   The general procedures and provisions applicable to all procedure types
are described below. Detail on each of the four procedures is presented in
§§ 17.1.400 et seq.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.305  STAFF REPORT.



   A staff report is not required for a Type I or Type II land use review.
The Director shall document the decision on Type I and Type II reviews with
the following information:



   A.   A statement that explains the criteria and standards considered
relevant to the request;



   B.   A statement of the facts relied upon in making the decision; and



   C.   An explanation of the justification for the decision based on
the criteria, standards and facts set forth.



   No decisions on Type III and IV land useapplications, or the appeal of
a Type II decision, shall be made without a staff report. The staff report
shall, at minimum, address divisions A. through C. above. The Director shall
have the authority to develop the content and organization of the report.



   The staff report shall be provided to the applicant and the review
authority without charge. All others may obtain a copy upon request and
payment of a reasonable fee to cover costs of copying and mailing. A staff
report shall be available no later than seven calendar days before a Type III
or IV hearing, or any hearing on appeal of a Type II decision.



   The staff report may be amended as necessary to address issues or
information not reasonably known at the time the report is due.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.310  CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.



   All review bodies have the authority to impose reasonable conditions of
approval to ensure that all applicable approval criteria are, or can be, met.
Conditions shall only be imposed where the applicant has the ability to
comply without depending upon the actions of other parties that are not
associated with the project unless agreements with the other parties are in
place prior to submittal. This requirement excludes a review or approval
required by a public agency. Failure to comply with any condition of approval
shall be grounds for revocation of the permit(s) and grounds for instituting
code enforcement proceedings.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.315  MODIFICATION OF CONDITIONS.



   An applicant may request modification of a condition of approval after
the final written decision is issued. A modification to condition(s) of
approval shall be processed in the same manner and subject to the same
standards as the original application.



   However, the review body may consider a modification request and limit
review of the approval criteria to those issues or aspects of the application
that are proposed to be changed from what was originally approved.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.320  REVOCATION OF A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PERMIT.



   In the event an applicant, or the applicant’s successor in interest,
fails to comply with all conditions of permit approval; the City Council,
Planning Commission or Director may institute a revocation proceeding for
Type I, II, III or IV permits if it is determined there is substantial
likelihood that any of the following situations exist:



   A.   One or more conditions of approval have not been implemented or
have been violated; or



   B.   The activities, or the use itself, are substantially different
from what was approved.



   Revocation or modification of a previously approved permit shall be
considered and decided by the City Council. Type III notice procedures shall
be followed. The Director or any private complaining party shall have the
burden to prove, based on substantial evidence in the whole record, that the
applicant or the applicant’s successor has violated the city’s approval.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.325  TRANSFER OF APPROVAL RIGHTS.



   Unless stated otherwise in the city’s permit decision, any approval
granted under this Code runs with the land and is transferred with ownership
of that land. Any conditions, time limits or other restrictions imposed with
a permit approval shall bind all subsequent owners of the property for which
the permit was granted.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



TYPE I PROCESS – ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS



§ 17.1.400  DEFINITION.



   An administrative decision is one that requires no interpretation or
exercise of policy or legal judgment in evaluating approval criteria.



   Because the decision is made according to specific criteria where no
discretion is involved, administrative decisions do not qualify as land use
or limited land use decisions as defined by O.R.S. 197.015.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)

TYPE II PROCESS – LIMITED LAND USE DECISIONS



§ 17.1.500  DEFINITION.



   A limited land use decision involves the exercise of limited
interpretation and discretion in evaluating approval criteria, where approval
or denial is based on discretionary standards that regulate the physical
characteristics of an outright use.



   The review typically focuses on what form the use will take or how it
will look.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.1.505  TYPE II APPLICATIONS AND APPROVAL CRITERIA.



   Applications so designated throughout the Development Code are reviewed
under the Type II process, based on the requirements and criteria set forth
for each application in other sections of this Code.



   ∙   Examples of these applications include:



   ∙   Certain types of Zoning Standard adjustments

§ 17.1.510  ELEVATION OF TYPE II APPLICATION TO TYPE III PROCESS.



   If, in the opinion of the Director, there is potential for neighborhood
or community concern about a proposal, the applicant or the Director may
elevate a Type II application to the Type III process to provide greater
notice and opportunity to participate than would otherwise be required by
this Code.



   Elevation to a Type III process will result in a public hearing and
decision by the Planning Commission or other review body rather than a
decision by the Director. An applicant may request that a Hearings Officer
consider any land use review subject to Type III procedures, including a Type
II application that is elevated to a Type III procedure. The applicant shall
pay all extra costs associated with the Hearings Officer review.

conclusive evidence of a good faith attempt to contact all persons listed in
the certificate.

TYPE III PROCESS – QUASI-JUDICIAL LAND USE DECISIONS



§ 17.1.600  DEFINITION.



   A land use decision, as defined in O.R.S. 197.015(10), includes final
decisions or determinations concerning the adoption, amendment or application
of the goals, a comprehensive plan provision, a land use regulation or a new
land use regulation.



   In general, land use decisions require the greatest amount of
discretion and the evaluation of subjective approval standards. Land use
decisions that are site-specific in nature are classified as Type III
quasi-judicial decisions and land use decisions that apply to the general
population and prescribe policy are classified as Type IV legislative
decisions.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)

(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.030  CONCURRENT REVIEWS.



   Applications for more than one land use review on a site may be
consolidated into a single application package. If the reviews are not
assigned to the same review body, they are assigned in the manner stated
below.



   A.   When more than one review is requested and the reviews have
different procedures, the overall application is processed using the highest
procedure and reviewed by the review body assigned to that procedure.



   B.   When the requested reviews have the same procedure but are
assigned different review bodies, the reviews may be processed simultaneously
with a joint hearing before the applicable review bodies.



   For the purposes of this section, a joint hearing includes either
holding a consolidated hearing before all applicable review bodies at the
same meeting, or holding consecutive public hearings at the same location.



   The Director shall determine the manner of processing applications and
conducting the hearings.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON LAND USE REVIEWS



§ 17.2.050  INTRODUCTION.



   The Development Code uses a combination of nondiscretionary and
discretionary reviews to evaluate land use proposals for compliance with the
use and development requirements of the Code. The nondiscretionary reviews
provide the certainty needed in most situations by providing clear and
objective criteria. Discretionary reviews provide needed flexibility by
allowing more subjective criteria, and providing for the modification of
regulations in response to specific site conditions.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.060  FUNCTION OF REVIEW CRITERIA.



   A.   Review criteria set the bounds for the issues that must be
addressed by the applicant and which may be raised by the city or affected
parties.



   B.   The review criteria have been derived from and are based on the
Comprehensive Plan. Reviews using the goals and policies of the Comprehensive
Plan are not required unless specifically stated.



   C.   When review criteria refer to the request’s meeting a
specific threshold, such as adequate services, the threshold includes any
proposed improvements, mitigation measures or limitations. All proposed
improvements, mitigation measures and limitations must be identified prior to
a final decision by a review body.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.070  BURDEN OF PROOF.



   The burden of proof is on the applicant to show that all applicable
review criteria are met.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.080  CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.



   The city may attach conditions to the approval of a land use decision
in order to ensure that the proposal will conform to the applicable review
criteria.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.090  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGULATIONS.



   Approval of a land useapplication based on review criteria in this Code
does not relieve the applicant of responsibility for compliance with other
applicable codes, ordinances, statutes or regulations.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



ADJUSTMENT



§ 17.2.100  PURPOSE.

make limited modifications to yardsetback, height and lot coverage standards.
Adjustment reviews provide limited flexibility for unusual situations if the
proposed development continues to meet the intended purpose of the
regulations.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.110  PROCEDURE.

(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



CONDITIONAL USE



§ 17.2.200  PURPOSE.



   Certain uses are conditional uses instead of being allowed outright,
although they may have beneficial effects and serve important public
interests. Conditional uses are subject to review because they may have
adverse effects on the environment, overburden public services, change the
desired character of an area or create nuisances. The conditional use review
provides an opportunity to allow the use when there are minimal impacts, to
allow the use but impose conditions to address identified concerns, or to
deny the use if the concerns cannot be resolved.



   Uses that require conditional use review are stated in the use tables
of the zoning districts or in the regulations of overlay zones that apply to
the site.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.210  PROCEDURE.



   Conditional uses are reviewed under a Type II or Type III procedure. In
addition to the requirements of this section, conditional uses are required
to meet applicable site plan and design review requirements of this Code (a
separate application and fee is not required).



   A.   New conditional use. A request for a new conditional use is
reviewed under Type III procedures.



   B.   Minor modifications. A request for a minor modification to an
approved conditional use may be reviewed provided the following criteria are
met:



      1.   The alteration does not violate any conditions of
approval; and



      2.   The individual or cumulative alterations will not
increase the floor area or exterior improvement area by more than 20%; and



      3.   The Director determines that there is a likelihood that
the proposed modification would not result in noticeable impacts on adjacent
properties.



   If the request meets the above criteria, notice of the proposed request
shall be sent consistent with a Type II process. If the department receives
any negative response from the notices, then the applicant shall file for a
conditional use permit as a new application to be reviewed by the Planning
Commission.



   C.   Major modifications. All other alterations to the site or use
will be reviewed under Type III procedures.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.220  REVIEW CRITERIA.



   All of the following criteria must be met for approval of a new
conditional use, or the major modification of an existing conditional use:



   A.   Physical compatibility.



      1.   The proposed use will be compatible with adjacent
developments based on characteristics such as the site size, building scale
and style, setbacks and landscaping; or



      2.   The proposed use will mitigate differences in appearance
or scale through setbacks, screening, landscaping and other design features.



   B.   Public services.



      1.   The transportation system is capable of safely supporting
the proposed use in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation
factors include street capacity and level of service, access to arterials,
transit availability, on-street parking impacts, access requirements,
neighborhood impacts and pedestrian safety; and



      2.   Public services for water supply, sanitary sewer,
stormwater disposal, police and fire protection are capable of serving the
proposed use and previously approved uses.



   C.   Livability. The proposed conditional use will not have
significant adverse impacts on the livability of nearby lands due to:



      1.   Noise, glare from lights, late-night operations, odors
and litter; and



      2.   Privacy and safety issues.

§ 17.2.320  OVERVIEW OF PROCESS.



   Design review applications will be processed in one of two tracks:
Development Standards or Design Guidelines. The applicant shall identify the
desired tract as part of the initial application. The tracks are described as
follows:



   Track 1-Development Standards. Applications are required to meet the
clear and objective development standards which are provided in the
Development Code. These requirements are intended to be specific and
directive. The purpose is to establish a baseline for site plan design which
works in conjunction with other requirements of the Development Code.



   Track 2-Design Guidelines. Applications allow more flexibility in terms
of design. Under this process the applicant shall be held to the intent of
the standards, but is allowed to vary from these standards if demonstrated
that related guidelines and objectives are adequately addressed and that the
deviation results in a higher quality development than would result under a
strict interpretation of the Code.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.330  PROCEDURE.



   The design review applicant must select one of two design review
tracks: (1) development standards track or the (2) design guidelines track.

district.



   D.   Restrictions on uses or development that contain the word
“Prohibited.”



   E.   A change in established procedures.



   A variance may be permitted if the review authority finds that the
applicant has complied with all review criteria.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2016-16, passed 9-26-2016)



§ 17.2.710  PROCEDURE.



   Variances are reviewed under the Type III procedure.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.720  REVIEW CRITERIA.



   A.   The need for the variance does not result from prior actions of
the applicant or owner, or from personal circumstances of or caused by the
applicant or owner, such as financial circumstances;



   B.   To meet the need, the request is the minimum necessary
variation from the Code requirement; and



   C.   The circumstances that apply to the site do not typically apply
to other properties in the same vicinity or zoning district and are unique or
unusual.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



ZONE CHANGE



§ 17.2.750  PURPOSE.



   Changes in the Official Zoning Map may be needed over time to implement
the Forest Grove Comprehensive Plan, to assign zoning to recently annexed
properties, comply with regional and statewide goals and rules, and to
respond to changes in local circumstances and development patterns.



   This subarticle provides standards and criteria for amending the Zoning
Map. The process for amending the Comprehensive Plan Map is different and is
discussed in that document.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.760  PROCEDURE.



   A.   Quasi-judicial. Requests for a quasi-judicial zone change are
reviewed under the Type III procedure. Quasi-judicial zone changes involve a
single property or small number of properties. Unlike other Type III
procedures, the decision of the Planning Commission on a quasi-judicial zone
change shall be in the form of a recommendation to the City Council . The
City Council shall hold another public hearing and make the final decision .



   B.   Legislative. Requests for a legislative zone change are
reviewed under the Type IV procedure. Legislative zone changes involve
numerous properties or broad geographic areas of the city .



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.770  REVIEW CRITERIA.



   A.   The zone change is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan Map.
When the Comprehensive Plan has more than one implementing zone as shown on
the Correspondence Table in Article 3, it must be shown that the proposed
zone is the most appropriate, taking into consideration the purposes of each
zone and the zoning pattern of surrounding land.



   B.   The zone change is consistent with relevant goals and policies
of the Comprehensive Plan, as identified by the Director.



   C.   The site is suitable for the proposed zone and there is a lack
of appropriately designated alternative sites within the vicinity. The size
of the vicinity will be determined on a case-by-case basis since the impacts
of a proposed zone and its potential uses vary. The factors to be considered
in determining suitability are parcel size and location.



   D.   The zone change is consistent with the adopted Transportation
System Plan. Development allowed by the zone change will not substantially
impact the functional classification or operation of transportation
facilities, or reduce the level of service of transportation facilities below
the minimum acceptable level identified in the Transportation System Plan. To
ensure proper review and mitigation, a traffic impact study may be required
for the proposed zone change if it may impact transportation facilities.



   E.   Public facilities and services for water supply, sanitary waste
disposal, stormwater disposal and police and fire protection are capable of
supporting the uses allowed by the zone. Adequacy of services is based on the
projected service demands of the site and the ability of the public services
to accommodate those demands.



   F.   The establishment of a zone district is not subject to the
meeting of conditions.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS



§ 17.2.800  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of a Development Agreement is to implement the goals,
policies or programs of the Comprehensive Plan, the requirements of the
Development Code or another city code, or a condition of an approved land use
permit, or for the development of land. This subarticle provides the process,
standards and criteria for the review of a development agreement.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.2.810  APPLICABILITY.



   The city may enter into a development agreement with any person having
a legal or equitable interest in real property for the development of that
property. The contents, review and approval of a development agreement shall
comply with the requirements of O.R.S. 94.504 to 94.528 as well as the
city’s requirements.

RESIDENTIAL ZONES



§ 17.3.100  PURPOSE.



   The City of Forest Grove has established five six residential zones to
implement the Residential designations of the Comprehensive Plan. The zones
provide the flexibility for a range of lot sizes and housing types. The six
zones are distinguished primarily by the number of dwelling units permitted
per net acre. Target densities are established for each zone. The Code also
provides an opportunity for a density bonus in each of the zones to encourage
special design features and amenities when a Planned Development (PD) process
is followed. The regulations of the residential zones are intended to protect
the livability of existing and future residential neighborhoods by
encouraging primarily residential development with compatible non-residential
development at appropriate locations and at an appropriate scale. Another
purpose of these regulations is to encourage a full range of owner-occupied
and rental housing at affordable prices.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.3.110  LIST OF RESIDENTIAL ZONES.



   A.   Suburban Residential SR. The SR zone is intended for
development of housing at a target density of 1.0 dwelling unit per net acre
. Detached single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this
zone. Accessory dwelling units are also permitted subject to the density
limitations of the zone. A limited range of compatible non-residential uses
such as parks and schools are permitted or allowed with conditional use
permit approval.



   B.   Residential R-10. The R-10 zone is intended for development of
housing at a target density of 4.35 dwelling units per net acre . Detached
single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this zone.
Accessory dwelling units , duplexes and attached housing types are also
permitted subject to the density limitations of the zone. A limited range of
compatible non-residential uses such as parks and schools are also permitted
or allowed with conditional use permit approval.



   C.   Residential R-7. The R-7 zone is intended for development of
housing at a target density of 6.22 dwelling units per net acre . Detached
single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this zone.
Accessory dwelling units , duplexes and attached housing types are also
permitted subject to the density limitations of the zone. A limited range of
compatible non-residential uses such as parks and schools are also permitted
or allowed with conditional use permit approval.



   D.   Residential R-5. The R-5 zone is intended for development of
housing at a target density of 8.71 dwelling units per net acre . Detached
single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this zone.
Accessory dwelling units , duplexes and attached housing types are also
permitted subject to the density limitations of the zone. A limited range of
compatible non-residential uses such as parks and schools are also permitted
or allowed with conditional use permit approval.



   E.   Residential RML. The RML zone is intended for development of
housing at a target density of 12 dwelling units per net acre . Small-lot
single-family housing, duplexes , attached dwellings and small multi-dwelling
residences will be permitted housing types, subject to the density
limitations of the zone. A limited range of compatible non-residential uses
such as parks and schools are also permitted or allowed with conditional use
permit approval. The RML zone functions as a transition zone between the
lower density residential zones and the higher intensity residential and
non-residential zones.



   F.   Residential RMH. The RMH zone is intended for development at a
target density of 20.28 dwelling units per net acre . Multi-unit residential
buildings will be the predominant housing type in this zone. RMH zoning is
generally applied near transit streets and adjacent to commercial districts.
The RMH zone also allows a limited range of non-residential uses to help
provide services for residents and enhance the quality of the higher density
neighborhood.

§ 17.3.130  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   A.   Residential Densities.



   The City of Forest Grove regulates residential development primarily by
density rather than minimum lot size. Density is calculated based on net site
area. Within the density limits of each of the five residential zones, a
variety of housing types and lot sizes are permitted. This approach allows
more sites to be developed with the flexibility of a Planned Development .



   All residential subdivisions and multi-family developments are required
to develop at a minimum of 80% of the targeted density .

*Only allowed a part of a Planned Development (see § 17.4.200)




 



   B.   Calculating potential densities. The number of dwelling units
allowed on a parcel in any of the five residential zones is calculated using
Table 3-3. Density calculations count dwelling units (not structures ), i.e.,
a duplex is counted as two dwelling units. Accessory dwelling units are not
counted as dwelling units for the purpose of calculating density .



      1.   The Target Density is permitted outright.



      2.   The Minimum Density is required to ensure:



         a.   Land is being used at the appropriate intensity
planned for the area;



         b.   Enough dwelling units can be developed to
accommodate the projected need for housing; and



         c.   Compliance with the Metro Functional Plan.



      3.   The Incentive Density provides the opportunity for a
density bonus to reward design features, amenities and/or other improvements
which can be shown to increase the value of the residential development for
neighborhood residents and the general public and/or provide affordable
housing. Incentive Density is only allowed as part of a Planned Development
(see § 17.4.200).



   C.   Density reductions due to slope. All densities (target, minimum
and incentive) listed in Table 3-3 shall be reduced based on the slope of the
property as shown below. Where a parcel has areas of different slopes, the
property shall be divided up into areas of like slopes, and the reductions
applied to those areas. If the areas of similar slopes do not fit into the
categories below, the Director shall use a percentage reduction that is based
on the slope -to-density reduction relationship expressed in Table 3-4 (For
example, an area of 13% to 18% slope would receive a reduction of around 25%).

   For development sites over two acres that have an average slope greater
than 20% (see definition), development is only allowed through approval of a
Planned Development .



   D.   Exemptions from minimum density standards.



      1.   Small parcels. The minimum density standards set forth in
Table 3-3 focus primarily on subdivisions and multi-family developments . The
standards do not apply to individual single-family building permits on
existing parcels or to partitions or development on parcels smaller than
one-half acre . The city does not want to inhibit infill development or
require densities that are out of scale with established neighborhoods with
the application of minimum density standards to small parcels. However, this
exemption does not reduce the target density allowed outright on parcels
smaller than one-half acre ; it only removes the requirement for a minimum
number of units.



   E.   Incentive Density. Planned Developments may request a density
bonus up to a maximum of the Incentive Density shown in Table 3-3 and shall
be based on the following discretionary criteria:



      1.   The availability and accessibility of public
transportation, and/or connectivity improvements likely to result in reduced
vehicular use;



      2.   How well natural resources such as streams, riparian
areas and wetlands are protected, integrated into the design residential
development , defined as a common area, and made accessible to as many
individual parcels/units as possible;



      3.   How well common recreational areas are integrated into
the design of the residential development , such that there is the maximum
number of physical connections to lots and units, and visual connections to
future dwelling sites ;



      4.   Public accessibility and use of the common recreation
area where appropriate, given the intended use of the area, linkage to future
trails, etc.; and



      5.   Other design features, amenities and/or improvements
which can be shown (by use of built examples) to increase the value of the
residential development for neighborhood residents and the general public
and/or provide more affordable housing.



   F.   Minimum lot size and dimensions (SR, R-10, R-7 and R-5 Zones).
Varied lot sizes and housing types are permitted and encouraged within the
density ranges established for the SR, R-10, R-7 and R-5 Zones. As described
above, the number of units allowed on a parcel is based on the target density
allowed for the particular zone (see Table 3-3).



   The city has established base minimum lot size and dimensional
standards that apply after the potential number of units has been determined.
These standards ensue that each lot has enough area for a house, garage ,
setbacks and private outdoor area. To ensure that development can be built
near to and oriented toward the street , a minimum width at the front setback
line is required.



   The minimum lot size is the smallest permissible size of a building lot
. See Article 6 Land Divisions for additional lot development standards.

   G.   Minimum lot size and dimensions (RML and RMH Zones). Varied lot
sizes and housing types are permitted and encouraged within the density
ranges established for the RML and RMH Zones. However, construction of new
single-family detached units is restricted to existing lots smaller than
5,000 square feet in the RMH Zone in order to retain land for multi-family
housing. The following base minimum lot size and dimensional standards apply
after the potential number of units has been determined using Table 3-3.

   H.   Setback standards.Building setbacks have an important
relationship to the character of the street . Because varied lot sizes and
housing types are permitted in the residential zones, uniform setbacks are
established to provide a consistent streetscape.

feet directly back from any Standard Front Porch (see definitions) or front
-facing window such that a person (if there were no vegetation ) would be
able to see 100% of their front property line.

[2]   On an infill lot in a developed neighborhood with established front
yard setbacks that are less than the 20- foot standard, the setback for the
new dwelling (s) and the location of the garage shall match front yard
setback of the existing dwellings and garage location on abutting lots .
Setback compatibility shall be determined through building plan check review,
and shall not require a land use application or approval of an adjustment.

[3]   The side yard setback for attached single-family dwellings shall be
a minimum of zero feet at common walls and five feet or one foot for each
three feet of building height at the eave line, from the end of the unit
series. Unless approved by the Director , the dwellings shall be arranged on
lots in a manner that the non-zero setback portion for one lot shall be
adjacent to the non-zero setback portion on the adjoining lot in order to
provide greater continuous open space .

[4]   Accessory buildings (including accessory dwellings and detached
garages ) that do not exceed one story in height may be located on or within
five feet of an interior side yard property line or a rear property line .

[5]   Attached garages which exit to an alley may have a minimum rear yard
setback of five feet.

[6]   A larger rear yard setback may be required for multi-family
dwellings when the rear yard abuts a lower density residential zone. The need
for a larger rear yard setback to provide privacy, access to sunlight and a
transition between zones shall be evaluated in the Design Review Process. The
screening and buffering standards of Article 8 will be used as guidelines.



 



   I.   Building height.Building height standards are used to establish
a compatible building scale. This can help to create a harmonious visual
setting and helps to bring about a successful mixing of diverse housing types.



      1.   Buildings in the SR, R-10, R-7, R-5 and RML Zones are
limited to a maximum height of two and one-half stories or 35 feet, whichever
is less. Accessory buildings are limited to a maximum height of one and
one-half stories or 25 feet, whichever is less.



      2.   Buildings in the RMH Zone are limited to a maximum height
of three stories or 45 feet, whichever is less. A step-down in building
heights may be required for multi-family building (s) that abut a lower
density residential zone. The need for a step down in building heights to
provide privacy, access to sunlight and a transition between zones shall be
evaluated in the Design Review Process.



      3.   A chimney, radio or television antenna , or device
designed for the collection and/or generation of energy from the sun and/or
wind may exceed the building height limit by a maximum of 15 feet.



      4.   Church steeples may exceed 35 feet in height through a
Type II process.



   The maximum height is 15 feet above the building height limit in any
location allowed by other requirements of the zone district.



   Church steeples may go to a maximum total height of 75 feet provided
that setbacks of one foot for each one foot in height from the property line
are maintained.

Footnotes:

[1]  Side or rear yard setbacks may be required where the INST zone abuts a
Residential zone. The need for a side or rear yard setback to provide
privacy, access to sunlight and a transition between zones shall be evaluated
in the Conditional Use and/or Design Review Process.

[2]  To ensure that new development is oriented to the street , maximum
building setback standards may be established as part of the Conditional Use
and or Design Review Process in the INST zone.

[3]  Height limitations shall not apply to flag poles and field lights
provided that the Community Development Director finds that off-site light
intrusion is limited to the extent feasible.




 



   C.   Setbacks. The following setbacks shall be required for the
construction of any structure in this zone.



      1.   The setback of any respective yard (front, side or rear)
shall be equal to the minimum and maximum required yards for the property
abutting the respective yardslot line except as provided below.



      2.   In cases where the lot line of the INST zoned property
abuts properties with two or more different yard requirements the required
setback for abutting yard shall be equal to the average of the yards required
(minimum or maximum) for the abutting properties.



      3.   Additional setback requirements for any yard may be
established for development that is subject to Conditional Use approval.



      4.   An increased setback and buffer may be required where an
INST boundary abuts a less intensive zone. See screening and buffering
standards in §§ 17.8.400 et seq.



   Where conflicts exist, Article 8 standards shall prevail. When an
institutional site is separated from a residential zone by either a dedicated
public street or a railroad main line or spur track, no setback shall be
required in that yard adjacent to the residential zone.



   D.   Institutional uses. Institutional uses shall comply with the
development standards in Article 8 as well as any other applicable standards
in this Code.

COMMERCIAL AND MIXED USE ZONES



§ 17.3.300  PURPOSE.



   The City of Forest Grove has established two commercial zones to
implement the Commercial designation of the Comprehensive Plan, and one zone
to implement the Mixed Use designation of the Comprehensive Plan.



   The Neighborhood Commercial zone provides for limited commercial
activities at a neighborhood scale.



   The Community Commercial zone is established to accommodate commercial
uses with a community market focus and promote a concentration of mixed uses
along the regional transit corridor.



   The Neighborhood Mixed Use zone is established to encourage the
development of pedestrian-friendly mixed use neighborhoods.



   Additional commercial development opportunities are provided in the
Town Center Zones.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.3.310  LIST OF COMMERCIAL AND MIXED USE ZONES.



   A.   Neighborhood Commercial (NC). The NC zone is established to
provide for small to medium sized shopping and service facilities adjacent to
residential neighborhoods. The district is intended to meet the convenience
shopping and service needs of the immediate neighborhood and to have minimal
negative impacts on surrounding residential uses. NC zones should be located
on arterial or collector streets , preferably at an intersection. NC zones
should be spaced at approximately one-half mile intervals and each zoned area
should be limited to a total size of approximately two acres .



   B.   Community Commercial (CC). The CC zone is established to
promote a concentration of mixed uses – including retail, service, office
and residential uses – along the regional transit corridor. The link
between land use and transit is intended to result in an efficient
development pattern that supports the regional transit system and makes
progress in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. The location, mix
and configuration of land uses are designed to encourage convenient
alternatives to the auto, a safe and attractive streetscape, and a more
livable community.



   C.   Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU).  The Neighborhood Mixed Use zone
is established to support the development of pedestrian-friendly mixed use
neighborhoods with a diversity in the mix of housing types and
neighborhood-scale retail sales and service, office, civic or recreational
uses. Most non-residential uses must be located within a “Village
Center.” The Village Center is intended to serve as the center of the
neighborhood, providing convenient access to goods and services as well as
“third places” where residents can gather. The NMU Zone implements the
Comprehensive Plan ’s Mixed Use designation. Mixed Use Planned Development
approval is required in the NMU Zone in order to ensure that the objectives
of the Comprehensive Plan are addressed.

development standards and other regulations of this Code.



   B.   Limited uses. Uses that are allowed subject to specific
limitations are listed in Table 3-10 with an “L”. These uses are allowed
if they comply with the limitations listed in the footnotes to the table and
the development standards and other regulations of this Code.



   C.   Conditional uses. Uses that are allowed if approved through the
conditional use process are listed in Table 3-10 with a “C”. These uses
are allowed provided they comply with the conditional use approval criteria,
the development standards, and other regulations of this Code. § 17.2.200
contains the conditional use process and approval criteria.



   D.   Not permitted uses. Uses listed in Table 3-10 with an “N”
are not permitted or prohibited. Existing uses may be subject to the
regulations of §§ 17.7.100 et. seq.Nonconforming Development .



   E.   Accessory uses. Uses that are accessory to a primary use are
allowed if they comply with specific regulations for accessory uses and all
development standards.

required conditional use permit approval.

[2]   New development in the NC and CC zones is subject to Design Review
and the Screening & Buffering standards in Article 8. Side or rear yard
setbacks may be required where the CC zone abuts a Residential zone. The need
for a side or rear yard setback to provide privacy, access to sunlight and a
transition between zones shall be evaluated in the Design Review Process.

[3]   To ensure that new development is oriented to the street , maximum
building setback standards are established in the CC zone, as follows:

   a.   For sites with one building , a minimum of twenty feet or 50%
of the face of the building , whichever is greater, shall not exceed the
maximum front yard setback of 30 feet. The primary entrance shall be
contained within that portion of the building meeting the maximum setback
requirement.

   b.   For sites with more than one building , the primary entrance of
the building with the largest square footage shall be set back no more that
10% of the depth of the average depth of the lot or 50 feet, whichever is
lesser. Satellite buildings shall comply with the setback requirement of (a)
above.

   c.   There is no maximum setback for the area east of Oak Street.

[4]   A step-down in building heights may be required when a new
commercial building in the CC zone is proposed within 20 feet of a lower
density residential zone (SR, R-10, R-7 and R-5). The need for a step-down in
building heights to provide privacy, access to sunlight and a transition
between zones shall be evaluated in the Design Review Process. The screening
and buffering standards in Article 8 will be used as a guideline.

TOWN CENTER ZONES



§ 17.3.400  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the Town Center zones is to implement the Forest Grove
Town Center Plan and to reinforce the historic role of the downtown as the
civic, financial and business center. Two Town Center zones are adopted to
reflect the distinctions between different areas of the Town Center and to
focus pedestrian-oriented retail uses to the traditional downtown core along
Main Street. Specific development and design standards are adopted for the
Town Center zones to reflect the established storefront character of the area
and to enhance an active and attractive pedestrian environment for shoppers,
employees and residents.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.3.410  LIST OF TOWN CENTER ZONES.



   A.   Town Center Core (TCC). The Town Center Core zone encompasses
the traditional downtown core along Main Street. The purpose of this zone is
to provide a concentration of retail and office uses in a defined area.
Retail, service uses are required on the ground floor, with an emphasis on
those uses that serve a walk-in clientele. Office and/or residential uses are
allowed on upper floors. The design standards for this zone require a
continuous storefront facade featuring streetscape amenities for the
pedestrian.



   B.   Town Center Transition (TCT). The Town Center Transition zone
is established to increase employment and housing opportunities in close
proximity to the Town Center Core. A mix of retail, office, light industrial
and residential uses are allowed in the TCT zone, but ground floor retail
uses are permitted but not required. Consistent streetscape improvements such
as street lighting, street trees and sidewalks will link the Town Center
Transition zone with the Town Center Core.

§ 17.3.510  LIST OF INDUSTRIAL ZONES.



   A.   Light Industrial (LI). The LI zone is intended for a wide
variety of manufacturing and other industrial uses with controlled external
impacts. These types of industries are often involved in the secondary
processing of materials into components, the assembly of components into
finished products, transportation, communication and utilities, wholesaling
and warehousing. Industrial activities occur within enclosed buildings . On a
limited basis, supporting commercial and office uses are permitted in the LI
zone.



   B.   General Industrial (GI). The GI zone is intended for industrial
uses that are generally not compatible with residential development because
of their operational characteristics. This district is also intended for uses
that may require extensive outdoor areas to conduct business activities or
for product storage or display. General industrial uses include those
involved in the processing of raw materials into refined products and/or
industrial uses that have external impacts. The purpose of this district is
to permit the normal operations of any industry that can meet and maintain
compliance with established state and federal performance standards. The
district is intended to contain supportive retail development . Commercial or
retail uses that do not primarily serve the needs of people working or living
in the employment and industrial areas are prohibited in this district. New
residential uses are not permitted in the GI zone.



   C.   Business Industrial Park (BIP). The BIP zone is intended to
implement the Campus Employment designation of the Forest Grove Comprehensive
Plan through the identification of allowed uses and the establishment of
development standards. The BIP zone allows a mixture of light industrial,
employment and office uses, together with some small-scale commercial uses
with controlled external impacts. The development standards within the zone
require well-landscaped, attractive and cohesive developments .



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.3.520  USE REGULATIONS.



   Refer to Article 12 for information on the characteristics of uses
included in each of the Use Categories.

in Table 3-14 with a “P”. These uses are allowed if they comply with the
development standards and other regulations of this Code.



   B.   Limited uses. Uses that are allowed subject to specific
limitations are listed in Table 3-14 with an “L”. These uses are allowed
if they comply with the limitations listed in the footnotes to the table and
the development standards and other regulations of this Code.



   C.   Conditional uses. Uses that are allowed if approved through the
conditional use process are listed in Table 3-14 with a “C”. These uses
are allowed provided they comply with the conditional use approval criteria,
the development standards, and other regulations of this Code. § 17.2.200
contains the conditional use process and approval criteria.



   D.   Prohibited uses. Uses listed in Table 3-14 with an “N” are
prohibited. Existing uses may be subject to the regulations of §§ 17.7.100
et. seq.Nonconforming Development .



   E.   Accessory uses. Uses that are accessory to a primary use are
allowed if they comply with specific regulations for accessory uses and all
development standards.

OVERVIEW OF ARTICLE 4



§ 17.4.000  OVERVIEW OF ARTICLE 4.



   This article includes procedures and requirements related to zoning
overlay districts. Properties with an overlay designation will also have an
underlying zoning. Provision of the overlay district may add or modify
requirements of the underlying zoning district. Forest Grove has two overlay
districts:



   ∙   Master Plan



   ∙   Planned Developments



   ∙   Mixed Use Planned Developments



   The purpose of the Master Plan Zone is to promote and facilitate the
coordinated development of larger-scale institutional facilities through
adoption of a master plan. This article also includes procedures and
standards for Planned Developments (PD). The PD procedures are established to
provide greater flexibility in the development of land for residential,
commercial or industrial purposes than allowed outright by the base zones.
The Mixed Use Planned Development procedures are similar to the PD, but are
specifically intended for use within the Neighborhood Mixed Use Zone.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



MASTER PLAN ZONE



§ 17.4.100  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the Master Plan Zone is to promote and facilitate the
coordinated development of larger-scale institutional facilities through
adoption of a master plan. Submittal requirements and criteria for approval
of a master plan are outlined. When a master plan is approved, the Official
Zoning Map shall be amended to identify the Master Plan Zone, and the
approved master plan shall provide the standards for development within the
Master Plan Zone.



   Forest Grove has traditionally regulated uses such as Pacific
University and the Hospital as conditional uses in residential or commercial
zones. Each new building or modification of an existing building or use
required approval of a separate conditional use permit. This approach has not
provided an efficient framework for long-term development of institutional
facilities or a comprehensive review of development impacts.



   The Master Plan Zone provides a better tool to assure the community
those impacts on adjacent properties or the Forest Grove community are
addressed through the review and adoption of the Master Plan. After adoption
of the Master Plan, the institution has the assurance that new development
within the Master Plan Zone will be reviewed for consistency with the master
plan through a Type I process and will not require discretionary land use
review.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.4.105  APPLICABILITY.



   The Master Plan Zone is provided as an option for a limited number of
larger-scale institutional uses.



   The following uses may apply for the Master Plan Zone designation:



   A.   Hospitals and related medical facilities;



   B.   Government complexes;



   C.   Public high school facilities; and



   D.   Colleges or universities.



   The Master Plan Zone is not required for the institutional uses listed
above and the conditional use permit option will still be available for
development of these uses in residential and commercial zones.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.4.110  PROCEDURE.



   The Master Plan Zone will be reviewed through the Type IV legislative
process, with public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City
Council. After the Master Plan Zone is approved, future development projects
that are consistent with the master plan shall be reviewed through a Type I
administrative process. Projects not envisioned at the time of Master Plan
approval, or projects that depart from the Plan, shall be reviewed under a
Type II or Type III process, as described under § 17.4.125.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.4.115  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.



   In addition to general application requirements outlined in §
17.1.225, an application for the Master Plan Zone shall include the following:



   A.   Master plan boundaries. The application shall include a map of
all land proposed to be included within the Master Plan Zone. The land need
not be contiguous and more than one sub-area may be included in the Master
Plan Zone. The application shall include the signatures of all property
owners included within the proposed Master Plan Zone.



   B.   Narrative. The application shall include a narrative that
provides:



      1.   A general description of the institution’s development
plans for the duration of the master plan (ten to 20 years); and



      2.   A description of present and proposed uses, including
information as to the general amount and types of uses such as offices,
classrooms, recreation areas, dormitories, etc. The current and projected
number of students, employees, visitors or special events must be described

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS



§ 17.4.200  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the Planned Development (PD) provisions is to provide
greater flexibility in the development of land for residential, commercial or
industrial purposes than allowed by the conventional standards of the
Development Code. For residential sites over two acres that have an average
slope greater than 20%, development is allowed only through approval of a
planned development (see § 17.3.130, Table 3-4).



   A PD is not intended to be simply a means of avoiding normal
Development Code requirements. The PD provisions are intended to:



   A.   Promote flexibility and innovation in site design and permit
diversity in the location of structures in order to preserve natural features
and view corridors;



   B.   Promote innovative and creative design by providing a variety
and mixture of building types and architectural styles;



   C.   Promote efficient use of land and facilitate a more economical
arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses and utilities when
compared with conventional development patterns;



   D.   Preserve to the greatest extent possible existing landscape
features and amenities such as trees, creeks, ponds, floodplains, hills and
similar natural assets, and incorporate such features into the design of the
PD;



   E.   To encourage the provision of open space and recreational
facilities in a generally central location and within reasonable walking
distance of all living units in residential planned developments;



   F.   Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and
building relationships within the PD; and



   G.   Provide the applicant with reasonable assurance of ultimate
approval before requiring detailed design and engineering, while providing
the city with assurances that the project will retain the character
envisioned at the time of approval.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2017-12, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 17.4.205  PROCEDURES.



   A planned development is reviewed through a two-step process.



   A.   Preliminary plan. The preliminary plan is reviewed under Type
III procedures. The preliminary plan review examines the PD plan with respect
to items such as density , including the number, type and location of
dwelling units; parking; impacts on surrounding areas; adequacy of services;
and conceptual plan for service improvements. Preliminary plan approval will
only be granted when there is a reasonable certainty that the PD will fulfill
all applicable requirements of the City Codes.



   B.   Final plan. The final plan for the PD is reviewed under Type I
administrative procedures. The applicant must submit the detailed and
technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable city
standards, requirements and conditions have been  met. Approval will only be
granted if the final plan is in substantial conformance with the preliminary
plan.



   C.   Concurrent land division. A PD may be filed and processed
concurrently with a partition or subdivision application . All of the
submittal requirements and review standards of Article 6 will apply to a
concurrent PD/land division request. The tentative plat will be combined with
the preliminary PD review and the final plat will be combined with the final
PD review.



   D.   Sitedevelopment/design review. The PD approval may remove the
requirement for subsequent site development or design review of individual
buildings , if the PD includes building elevations and sufficient information
to demonstrate compliance with the applicable site development /design review
standards. The PD decision shall expressly state whether individual buildings
within the PD (such as commercial or multi-family buildings ) require site
development or design review approval.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2017-12, passed 11-27-2017)



§ 17.4.210  PROFESSIONAL DESIGN TEAM REQUIRED.



   The PD applicant must certify, in writing, that a member of each of the
following professions will be used in the planning and design process for the
proposed PD:



   A.   A licensed architect or professional urban designer;



   B.   A licensed landscape architect, a certified nurseryman or
landscape designer approved by the Director; and



   C.   A registered civil engineer or land surveyor.



   One of the above professionals shall be designated by the applicant to
act as a liaison between the Community Development Department, the design
team, and the applicant during the two-step PD review process. The Planning
Commission or City Council may require the expertise of other professionals
on the design team if it is determined that the site merits special
consideration to unique or adverse features or conditions.

apply unless they are superceded by the standards of this section or the PD
approval. Exceptions from the standards of the underlying zoning district
must be warranted based on the unique design and amenities incorporated into
the development plan, and shall have a beneficial effect which could not be
achieved using the standards of the underlying zoning district . Exceptions
shall be clearly and specifically identified in the application , which shall
also include an explanation justifying and substantiating the need for each
exception .



   B.   Site size. There are no minimum or maximum size limitations for
a PD.



   C.   Calculation of density. The number of dwelling units allowed in
residential zone PDs shall be calculated on the basis of § 17.3.130A. Table
3-2. All residential development shall be at a minimum of 80% of the target
density for the parent zone. A request for incentive density may be approved
for the PD, based on the criteria in § 17.3.130E.



   D.   Multiple base zones. When a proposed PD site includes more than
one base zone, the uses and residential density may be allocated throughout
the site without regard to zoning boundaries.



   E.   Lot sizes. There are no required minimum lot sizes.



   F.   Housing types allowed. Housing types in zones that allow
residential uses are not restricted in the PD, except that housing types in
the RML and RMH zones shall include a mixture of single-family , duplex or
multi-family units.



   G.   Architectural Pattern Book. In residential PDs, a variety of
architectural styles shall be required. For all PDs, a compendium of
architectural elevations, details and colors of each building type shall be
submitted. The pattern book shall act as the architectural control for the
homeowner’s association or the commercial owner. The pattern book shall

   I.   Buildingsetbacks.Building setbacks are established as part of
the preliminary development plans approval. Garage setbacks shall be a
minimum of 20 feet. No building projections (roofs or foundations) shall be
permitted in the front yard public utility easement required by §
17.8.905E.1.



   J.   Peripheral yards. Along the boundary of any PD, a yard at least
as deep as that required in the underlying zone district shall be provided.



   K.   Open space. At least 20% of the buildable portion of the PD not
in streets and driveways must be devoted to open space . At least half of the
open space in all zones must be in common ownership and at least half of that
space must be contained in one tract. The tract’s configuration shall be
45% of the site ’s overall length and width with a minimum dimension of 20
feet. The extent to which any type of open space satisfies the total open
space requirement shall be in the sole discretion of the city .



   L.   Parking. The base zone parking requirements apply. Common
parking and maneuvering areas must be set back at least 20 feet from the
boundary of the PD.



   M.   Water features. Water features such as streams or ponds must be
left in a natural state unless altered to improve the natural values of the
water feature or to improve stormwater drainage. Water features and their
edges should be kept in common ownership.



   N.   Facilities and services. It is the responsibility of the
applicant to provide all service facilities necessary for the functioning of
the PD. Service facilities such as streets , water supply facilities,
sanitary sewers and stormwater detention facilities must be dedicated to the
public if they are to provide service to any property not included in the PD.
However, the review body may approve private service facilities with the
consent of the appropriate service provider.



   O.   Development regulations and design standards not subject to
modification. The PD process cannot be used to vary or take an exception from
the Street Standards listed in § 17.8.610.



   P.   Underground utilities. All service facilities must be placed
underground except those that by their nature must be on or above ground,
such as fire hydrants and open watercourses. The applicant is responsible for
making the necessary arrangements with utility companies and other
appropriate entities when installing all service facilities.



   Q.   Construction to standards. All service facilities dedicated to
the public must be constructed to city standards. All private service
facilities must be designed by a qualified civil engineer to city standards
or comparable design life as determined by the City Engineer .

MIXED USE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT



§ 17.4.300  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the Mixed Use Planned Development is to ensure that
sites zoned Neighborhood Mixed Use are developed into pedestrian-friendly
mixed use neighborhoods. In order to accomplish that, Mixed Use Planned
Developments need to provide:



   A.   Diversity in the mix of housing types including single-family
houses, apartments, row houses, cottages, senior housing and residential
units above commercial or office space;



   B.   Pedestrian-orientation in the arrangement and placement of
buildings, parking and circulation systems, land uses and utilities;



   C.   Pedestrian and bicycle access to, and through, the site and
provide connectivity to adjacent areas for motorized and non-motorized modes
of transportation;



   D.   Neighborhood-scale retail sales and service, office, civic or
recreational uses conveniently located for neighborhood access, thereby
contributing to the livability of the area by reducing the amount of vehicle
miles traveled to reach goods and services;



   E.   Coordinated architectural styles, landscaping building forms
and building relationships which help establish a cohesive sense of place;



   F.   An urban form that emphasizes the efficient use of land and
compact urban form;



   G.   The applicant with reasonable assurance of ultimate approval
before requiring detailed design and engineering, while providing the city
with assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the
time of approval; and



   H.   A basis for discretionary review of an overall plan of
development that can subsequently be developed in phases over time with
administrative approval.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2016-3, passed 3-28-2016)



§ 17.4.305  PROCEDURES.



   A Mixed Use Planned Development (MUPD) is reviewed through a two-step
process.



   A.   Preliminary plan. The preliminary plan is reviewed under Type
III procedures. The preliminary plan review examines the MUPD with respect to
items such as the mix of uses; density , including the number, type and
location of dwelling units; the location and amount of non-residential uses;
parking; impacts on surrounding areas; adequacy of services; and conceptual
plan for service improvements. Preliminary plan approval will only be granted
when there is a reasonable certainty that the MUPD will fulfill all
applicable requirements of the City Codes.



   B.   Final plan. The final plan for the MUPD is reviewed under Type
I administrative procedures. The applicant must submit the detailed and
technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable city
standards, requirements and conditions have been met. Approval will only be
granted if the final plan is in substantial conformance with the preliminary
plan.



   C.   Concurrent land division. A MUPD may be filed and processed
concurrently with a partition or subdivision application ; however, no land
division shall be approved unless it is found to be consistent with the
applicable MUPD. All of the submittal requirements and review standards of
Article 6 will apply to a concurrent MUPD/land division request. The
tentative plat will be combined with the preliminary MUPD review and the
final plat will be combined with the final MUPD review.



   D.   Sitedevelopment/design review. The MUPD approval shall remove
the requirement for subsequent site development or design review of
individual buildings , if the MUPD includes building elevations and
sufficient information to demonstrate compliance with the applicable site
development /design review standards. The MUPD decision shall expressly state
whether individual buildings within the MUPD (such as commercial or
multi-family buildings ) shall require subsequent site development or design
review approval.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2016-3, passed 3-28-2016)



§ 17.4.310  PROFESSIONAL DESIGN TEAM REQUIRED.



   For MUPDs over three gross acres in size, the MUPD applicant must
certify, in writing, that a member of each of the following professions will
be used in the planning and design process for the proposed MUPD:



   A.   A licensed architect or professional urban designer approved by
the Planning Director;



   B.   A licensed landscape architect, a certified nurseryman or
landscape designer approved by the Director; and



   C.   A registered civil engineer or land surveyor.



   One of the above professionals shall be designated by the applicant to
act as a liaison between the Community Development Department, the design
team, and the applicant during the two-step MUPD review process. The Planning
Commission or City Council may require the expertise of other professionals
on the design team if it is determined that the site merits special
consideration to unique or adverse features or conditions.

(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.020  PROHIBITIONS.



   A.   The planting of any invasive non-native or noxious vegetation
is prohibited within the NRA.



   B.   Outside storage of materials is prohibited within the NRA,
unless such storage began before the effective date of this Code; or, unless
such storage is approved during development review under either §§ 17.5.035
or 17.5.040.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.025  CRITERIA.



   The request for vegetation removal shall be approved based on the
criteria below.



   A.   The permanent impact will be negligible or minor and mitigation
meets the requirements of this section, § 17.5.035D. or that allowed by §
17.5.040.



   B.   The removal is necessary to prevent the spread of disease or
insects declared to be a nuisance by a government agency or qualified
arborist, or to correct or eliminate a natural hazard (as identified by the
city or qualified arborist) to the property owner, surrounding properties or
community at large.



   C.   The loss of value will be of temporary duration of two years or
less until new vegetation can be established, or the mitigation plan provides
satisfactory replacement of the lost vegetation and establishment of a new
resource area of equal value to be completed within two planting seasons.
Mitigation for lost vegetation is preferred on-site, or within the immediate
vicinity of the subject site. Off-sitemitigation may be approved if there is
no reasonable alternative and a method of guaranteeing permanent use of the
area off-site is found, such as dedication of the area to a public entity,
easement or deed restriction.



   D.   Timetables for the work shall be established which minimize the
impact on wildlife.



   E.   Notwithstanding the above criteria, intrusion into the natural
resource area is allowed provided the requirements in §§ 17.5.035 or
17.5.040 are met.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.030  CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLANS.



   In order to ensure that trees and vegetation within NRAs are not
damaged during construction, all applicants, even those not developing within
an NRA, shall provide a construction management plan that includes the
following information:



   A.   Location of siteaccess and egress that construction equipment
will use;



   B.   Equipment and material staging and stockpile areas;



   C.   Erosion and sediment control measures; and



   D.   Measures to protect trees and other vegetation located within
the NRA, but outside of the disturbance area approved under the provisions of
§§ 17.5.035 or 17.5.040.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.035  STANDARDS.



   The following standards are to be met when the subject site contains
natural resource areas. In order of preference, these natural resource areas
are to be avoided when development as allowed by the underlying zone district
can be achieved outside the area or through alternative site design allowed
by a planned development; minimize intrusion into the area to the extent
feasible; or mitigate impacts from intrusions where no feasible alternatives
exists. The following standards shall apply to achieve these avoid, minimize
or mitigate objectives. As an alternative, the applicant may submit for
discretionary approval pursuant to § 17.5.040:



   A.   Methods for avoiding or minimizing disturbance in Natural
Resource Areas. The following habitat-friendly development practices may be
used to avoid or minimize development within NRAs by allowing flexible site
design:



      1.   Buildingsetback flexibility to avoid, or minimize,
development within NRAs. The minimum buildingsetback of the base zone may be
reduced to any distance between the base zone minimum and zero, unless this
reduction conflicts with applicable fire or life safety requirements;



      2.   Flexible landscaping requirements to avoid, or minimize,
development within NRAs.



         a.   Landscaping requirements, apart from those required
for parking lots or streetberms, may be met by preserving the NRA.



         b.   Facilities that infiltrate stormwater onsite,
including the associated piping, may be placed within the NRA so long as the
forest canopy and the areas within the drip lines of the trees are not
disturbed. Such facilities may include, but are not limited to, vegetated
swales, rain gardens, vegetated filter strip and vegetated infiltration
basins. Only native vegetation may be planted in these facilities.



      3.   Flexible Site Design (On-siteDensity Transfer) to avoid
or minimize development within NRAs.



         a.   Residential. For residential development, up to
100% of the development that could be allowed on lands within a natural
resource areas can be transferred to other portions of the property outside
the resources area.



         b.   In order to accommodate the transferred density,
dimensional standards and lot sizes may be adjusted by no more than 20%. 



         c.   Commercial and industrial developments shall avoid
natural resource areas unless no other practicable alternative is available.



         d.   Mixed-Use Zones. Within mixed-use zones, the
density transfer credit can be factored using either a. or b. above,
depending on the type of development proposed.



      4.   Site capacity incentives.  The following site capacity
standards provide flexibility in the design of land divisions in order to
allow ways to better protect NRAs.



         a.   Density bonus if NRA is protected. In the
Multi-Family (RMH) Residential Zone District, a 25% density bonus over the
based density may be allowed for any development of four or more dwelling
units if 75% or more of the NRA on a site is permanently preserved.



         b.   All area within a NRA, or any portion of it, may be
subtracted from the calculations of net size for purposes of determining
minimum density provided that such area is protected. This provision may only
be applied to properties that were inside the Metro UGB on January 1, 2002.



         c.   Projects can be developed below minimum density
allowed by the zone district if the natural resource area is protected. This
provision may only be applied to properties that were inside the Metro UGB on
January 1, 2002.



      5.   All natural resource areas that are preserved shall be
permanently restricted from development and maintained for habitat functions,
such as by making a public dedication or executing a restrictive covenant.



   B.   Development within NRA. The following development standards
apply to all development that occurs within the NRA except for exempt uses
and conditioned activities addressed in § 17.5.015 and utility facilities
addressed in § 17.5.035C.  If all development occurs outside of an NRA on a
property, these standards do not apply.  These standards also do not apply
to development that occurs pursuant to the standards established by the
alternative discretionary development standards in § 17.5.040.



      1.   Disturbance area limitations to minimize impact to NRA.



         a.   Single-family residential. The maximum disturbance
area (MDA) allowed within NRAs is determined by subtracting the area of the
lot or parcel outside of Habitat Conservation Area (HCA) from the total
disturbance area (TDA) calculated as described in Table 5-1 below.



               (TDA – Area outside the HCA = MDA)



            i.   Moderate and Low HCAs are subject to the same
disturbance area limitations.



            ii.   Calculation of maximum disturbance area. If
a lot or parcel includes both High and Moderate/Low HCAs then:



               (1)   If there is more High HCA than
Moderate/Low HCA on the lot or parcel, then the MDA shall be calculated as if
all of the Moderate/Low and High HCA were High, per Table 5-1 below; or



               (2)   If there is more Moderate/Low HCA than
High HCA on the lot or parcel, then the MDA shall be calculated as if all of
the Moderate/Low and High HCA were Moderate/Low, per Table 5-1 below.



            iii.   Location of MDA.  If a lot or parcel
includes different types of HCAs, then:



               (1)   The amount of development that may
occur within the High HCA is equal to the total disturbance area minus the
area of the lot or parcel outside of the High HCA (TDA – non-High HCA =
MDA). If the area of the lot or parcel outside the High HCA is greater than
the total disturbance area, then development shall not occur within the High
HCA:



            (Area outside High HCA > TDA = no development in High
HCA); 



               (2)   The amount of development that may
occur within the Moderate HCA is equal to the total disturbance area minus
the area of the lot or parcel outside of the High and Moderate HCA (TDA –
(Low HCA + non-HCA) = MDA). If the area of the lot or parcel outside the
Moderate HCA is greater than the total disturbance area, then development
shall not occur within the Moderate HCA:



            (Area outside Moderate HCA > TDA = no development in
Moderate HCA); and



               (3)   The amount of development that may
occur within the Low HCA is equal to the total disturbance area minus the
area of the lot or parcel outside of the High, Moderate and Low HCA (TDA –
non-HCA = MDA).  If the area of the lot or parcel outside the Low HCA is
greater than the total disturbance area, then development shall not occur
within the Low HCA:



            (Area outside Low HCA > TDA = no development in Low
HCA).

            ii.   Parks intended for active recreational
purposes as designated on the city’s Park, Recreation and Open Space Master
Plan shall not be considered in an NRA.



         d.   Development within an NRA in accordance with the
provisions of this Code shall not result in a change of the NRA status of
such developed areas on a property. In the case of a later development
request seeking to develop within previously undisturbed NRAs on a property
where a prior development request was subject to the provisions of this Code,
the calculation of the MDA allowed on the property shall be based on the
location of the NRA, notwithstanding the location of any authorized
development within the NRA.



      2.   Protection of habitat during sitedevelopment. During
development of any site containing a NRA, the following standards apply.



         a.   Work areas shall be marked to reduce potential
damage to the NRA.



         b.   Trees in NRAs shall not be used as anchors for
stabilizing construction equipment.



         c.   Native soils disturbed during development shall be
conserved on the property.



         d.   An erosion and sediment control plan is required
and shall be prepared in compliance with requirements set forth by Clean
Water Services Design and Construction Standards;



         e.   Prior to construction, the NRA that is to remain
undeveloped shall be flagged, fenced, or otherwise marked and shall remain
undisturbed.



         f.   All work on the property shall conform to the
Construction Management Plan described in § 17.5.030.



   C.   Utility facility standards. The following disturbance area
limitations apply to new utilities, private connections to existing or new
utility lines, and upgrade



      1.   The disturbance area for utility facility connections to
utility facilities is no greater than ten feet wide.



      2.   The disturbance area for the upgrade of existing utility
facilities is no greater than 15 feet wide.



      3.   The disturbance area for new underground utility
facilities is no greater than 25 feet wide and disturbs no more than 200
linear feet of Water Quality Resource Area, within any 1,000 linear foot
stretch of Water Quality Resource Area; provided that this disturbance area
shall be restored with the exception of necessary access points to the
utility facility.



      4.   No fill or excavation is allowed within the ordinary high
water mark of a stream, unless a permit is obtained from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers through the Standard Local Operating Procedures for Endangered
Species (SLOPES) process.



      5.   Mitigation is required as described in § 17.5.035D.
below.



   D.   Mitigation requirements for disturbance in NRAs. In order to
achieve the goal of reestablishing forested canopy that meets the ecological
values and functions described in this Chapter, tree replacement and
vegetation planting are required when development intrudes into a NRA
according to the following standards, except for wetlands mitigation
requirements imposed by state and federal law. 



      1.   Required plants and plant densities. All trees , shrubs
and ground cover must be native plants selected from the Metro Native Plant
List. An applicant must meet Mitigation Option 1 or 2, whichever results in
more tree plantings; except that where the disturbance area is one acre or
more, the applicant shall comply with Mitigation Option 2:



         a.   Mitigation Option 1. In this option, the mitigation
requirement is calculated based on the number and size of trees that are
removed from the site . Trees that are removed from the site must be replaced
as shown in Table 5-4. Conifers must be replaced with conifers. Bare ground
must be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs. Non-native sterile
wheat grass may also be planted or seeded, in equal or lesser proportion to
the native grasses or herbs.



 

Table 5-4: Tree Replacement


Size of tree to be removed (inches in diameter)
 
Number of trees and shrubs  to be planted



6 to 12

 

2 trees and 3 shrubs




13 to 18

 

3 trees and 6 shrubs

5 trees and 12 shrubs




25 to 30

 

7 trees and 18 shrubs




Over 30

 

10 trees and 30 shrubs




 



         b.   Mitigation Option 2. In this option, the mitigation
requirement is calculated based on the size of the disturbance area within a
NRA. Native trees and shrubs are required to be planted at a rate of five
trees and 25 shrubs per every 500 square feet of disturbance area. Bare
ground must be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs. Nonnative
sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded, in equal or lesser
proportion to the native grasses or herbs.



      2.   Plant size. Replacement trees must be at least one-half
inch in caliper , measured at six inches above the ground level for field
grown trees or above the soil line for container grown trees (the one-half
inch minimum size may be an average caliper measure, recognizing that trees
are not uniformly round), unless they are oak or madrone which may be one
gallon size. Shrubs must be in at least a one-gallon container or the
equivalent in ball and burlap and must be at least 12 inches in height.



      3.   Plant spacing.  Trees shall be planted between eight and
12 feet on-center and shrubs shall be planted between four and five feet on
center, or clustered in single species groups of no more than four plants,
with each cluster planted between eight and ten feet on-center. When planting
near existing trees , the drip line of the existing tree shall be the
starting point for plant spacing measurements.



      4.   Plant diversity. Shrubs must consist of at least two
different species. If ten trees or more are planted, then no more than 50% of
the trees may be of the same genus.



      5.   Location of mitigation area.  All vegetation must be
planted on the applicant ’s site within the NRA or in an area contiguous to
the NRA; provided, however, that if the vegetation is planted outside of the
NRA then the applicant shall preserve the contiguous area by executing a deed
restriction, such as a restrictive covenant. 



      6.   Invasive vegetation.  Invasive non-native or noxious
vegetation must be removed within the mitigation area prior to planting.



      7.   Tree and shrub survival.  A minimum of 80% of the trees
and shrubs planted shall remain alive on the fifth anniversary of the date
that the mitigation is completed.



      8.   Monitoring and reporting. Monitoring of the mitigation
site is the ongoing responsibility of the property owner. Plants that die
must be replaced in kind.  For a period of five years, the property owner
must submit an annual report to the Community Development Department
documenting the survival of the trees and shrubs on the mitigation site .



      9.   To enhance survival of the mitigation plantings, the
following practices are required.



         a.   Mulching. Mulch new plantings a minimum of three
inches in depth and 18 inches in diameter to retain moisture and discourage
weed growth.



         b.   Irrigation. Water new plantings one inch per week
between June 15 and October 15 for the three years following planting.



         c.   Weed control. Remove, or control, non-native or
noxious vegetation throughout maintenance period.



      10.   To enhance survival of tree replacement and vegetation
plantings, the following practices are recommended:



         a.   Planting season.  Plant bare root trees between
December 1 and February 28, and potted plants between October 15 and April 30.



         b.   Wildlife protection. Use plant sleeves or fencing
to protect trees and shrubs against wildlife browsing and resulting damage to
plants.



   E.   Standards for partitions and subdivisions. The purpose of this
section is to allow for partitions in a manner that limits the total amount
of allowable development within NRAs on the partitioned parcels; and to
require that new subdivision plats delineate and show the Moderate and High
NRAs as a separate unbuildable tract.



      1.   Standards for partitions containing NRAs.



         a.   When partitioning a property into parcels, an
applicant shall verify the boundaries of the NRA on the property according to
§ 17.5.050.



         b.   Applicants who are partitioning, but are not
simultaneously developing their property, do not need to comply with §
17.5.030.



         c.   When partitioning a property into parcels there
shall be no more than a 30 percentage point difference in the percentage of
NRA on the parcels; for example, a partition that produces two parcels, one
that is 55% NRA and the other that is 35% NRA is permissible; whereas a
partition that produces two parcels, one that is 75% NRA and the other that
is 30% NRA is not permissible. However, an applicant may partition a property
such that at least 90% of the original property’s High NRA and 80% of its
moderate NRA is on a separate unbuildable parcel, protected by a restrictive
covenant or a public dedication.



         d.   Subsequent development on any parcels containing
NRAs shall comply with § 17.5.030, and the development standards of either
§§ 17.5.035 or 17.5.040.



      2.   Standards for subdivisions.



         a.   Applicants who are subdividing, but not developing,
must verify the location of the NRA boundary according to § 17.5.050 of
these provisions, and comply with this § 17.5.035E.; such applicants do not
need to comply with § 17.5.030. Applicants who are sub-dividing, but not
developing, property may:



            i.   Complete the mitigation requirements of §
17.5.035D. and thereby exempt all subsequent development on lots containing
NRA from further review under this Code; or



            ii.   Not complete the mitigation requirements of
§ 17.5.035D., thus requiring that any subsequent development within an NRA
be subject to this Code.



         b.   Applicants who are subdividing and developing
properties must comply with §§ 17.5.030, 17.5.035 and 17.5.050.



         c.   When a property containing any NRA is subdivided,
this Code requires that new subdivisionplats delineate and show 80% of the
NRA as a separate unbuildable tract according to the following process:



         d.   If the tract is adjacent to the backyard for
residences, the minimum backyard requirement is reduced to ten feet.



         e.   The standards for land divisions in Moderate and
High NRAs shall apply in addition to the requirements of the city/county land
division ordinance and zoning ordinance.



         f.   Prior to preliminary plat approval, the NRA shall
be shown as a separate tract, which shall not be a part of any lot used for
construction of a dwelling unit.



         g.   Prior to final plat approval, ownership of the NRA
tract shall be identified to distinguish it from lots intended for sale. The
tract may be identified as any one of the following:



            i.   Private natural area held by the owner or
homeowners association by a restrictive covenant; or



            ii.   For residential land divisions, private
natural area subject to an easement conveying storm and surface water
management rights to the city and preventing the owner of the tract from
activities and uses inconsistent with the purpose of this Code; or



            iii.   At the owner’s option, public natural
area where the tract has been dedicated to the city or other governmental
unit, or a private nonprofit with the mission of land conservation.

§ 17.5.040  ALTERNATIVE DISCRETIONARY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   Applicants may choose to use the alternative discretionary development
standards provided in this section rather than the development standards
provided in § 17.5.035. There are four discretionary review processes
provided in this section: subsection A. provides discretionary review for an
applicant seeking only to partition a property; subsection B. provides
discretionary review for an applicant who will comply with the development
standards in § 17.5.035, except that the applicant seeks to meet the
mitigation requirements of that section on a different property from the
property on which a NRA will be disturbed; subsection C. provides
discretionary review for an applicant who will comply with the development
standards in § 17.5.035, except that the applicant seeks to meet the
mitigation requirements of that section by proportionally varying the number
and size of plants required to be planted; and subsection D. provides general
discretionary review standards applicable to an applicant seeking some other
type of discretionary approval of development that will disturb an NRA.



   A.   Discretionary review for partitions. An applicant seeking to
partition land in ways that do not accord with the standards established in
§ 17.5.035E.1. may seek review under this § 17.5.040A.



      1.   The applicant shall verify the boundaries of the NRAs on
the property according to § 17.5.050.



      2.   The applicant shall submit the following application
materials:



         a.   A scale map of the entire property that includes:



            i.   Location of all NRA on the property;



            ii.   Location of any wetlands or water bodies on
the property, including a delineation of the Water Quality Resource Area;



            iii.   Location of 100-year floodplain and
floodway boundary as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and the area of the 1996 flood inundation; and



            iv.   A delineation of the proposed partition.



         b.   A written and documented explanation of how and why
the proposed partition satisfies the approval criteria in § 17.5.040A.3.
Such written documentation shall include an alternatives analysis of
different possible partition plans, based on the characteristics and zoning
of the property.



      3.   Approval criteria. A partition shall be approved under
this § 17.5.040A. provided that the applicant demonstrates that it is not
practicable to comply with the partition standards in § 17.5.035E.1., and
that the applicant’s partition plan will result in the smallest practicable
percentage point difference in the percentage of NRA on the parcels created
by the partition (this will minimize the amount of allowable disturbance
areas within NRAs on the parcels, assuming that the development standards in
§ 17.5.035 were applied to future development on such parcels).



      4.   Subsequent development on any parcels created by the
partition and containing NRAs shall comply with all provisions of this
Chapter, except that the map verification completed and approved as part of
the partition may be used to satisfy the requirements of § 17.5.050 for any
such development.



   B.   Discretionary review to approve off-sitemitigation. An
applicant seeking discretionary approval only for off-site mitigation within
the same subwatershed (6th Field Hydrologic Unit Code), but who will comply
with all other provisions of § 17.5.035, may seek review under this §
17.5.040B. (An applicant who seeks to conduct the mitigation in a different
subwatershed may apply for such approval under § 17.5.040D.).



      1.   The applicant shall submit:



         a.   A calculation of the number of trees and shrubs the
applicant is required to plant under § 17.5.035D.; and



         b.   A map and accompanying narrative that details the
following:



            i.   The number of trees and shrubs that can be
planted on-site;



            ii.   The on-site location where those trees and
shrubs can be planted;



            iii.   An explanation of why it is not practicable
for the remainder of the mitigation to occur on-site; and



            iv.   The proposed location for off-sitemitigation
and documentation that the applicant can carry out and ensure the success of
the mitigation, including documentation that the applicant possesses legal
authority to conduct and maintain the mitigation, such as having a sufficient
ownership interest in the mitigationsite, and, if the mitigation is not
within a NRA, documentation that the mitigationsite will be protected after
the monitoring period expires, such as through the use of a restrictive
covenant.



      2.   Approval criteria. Off-sitemitigation shall be approved
under § 17.5.040B. provided that the applicant has demonstrated that it is
not practicable to complete the mitigation on-site and that the applicant has
documented that it can carry out and ensure the success of the
off-sitemitigation on a property within the same subwatershed (6th Field
Hydrologic Unit Code) as the related disturbed NRA.



      3.   Mitigation approved under § 17.5.040B. shall be subject
to all of the requirements of § 17.5.035D., except for the requirements of
§ 17.5.035D.5.



   C.   Discretionary review to approve mitigation that varies the
number and size of trees and shrubs.  An applicant seeking discretionary
approval only to proportionally vary the number and size of trees and shrubs
required to be planted under § 17.5.035D, for example to plant fewer larger
trees and shrubs or to plant more smaller trees and shrubs, but who will
comply with all other provisions of § 17.5.035, may seek review under §
17.5.040C.



      1.   The applicant shall submit:



         a.   A calculation of the number of trees and shrubs the
applicant would be required to plant under § 17.5.035D.;



         b.   The numbers and sizes of trees and shrubs that the
applicant proposes to plant;



         c.   An explanation of why the numbers and sizes of
trees and shrubs that the applicant proposes to plant will achieve, at the
end of the fifth year after initial planting, comparable or better mitigation
results as the results that would be achieved if the applicant complied with
all of the requirements of § 17.5.035D. Such explanation shall be prepared
and signed by a knowledgeable and qualified natural resources professional or
a certified landscape architect and shall include discussion of plant
diversity, plant spacing, site preparation including removal of invasive and
noxious vegetation and soil additives, planting season and immediate
postplanting care including mulching, irrigation, wildlife protection and
weed control; and



         d.   The applicant’s mitigationsite monitoring and
reporting plan.



      2.   Approval criteria. A request to vary the numbers and
sizes of trees and shrubs to be planted shall be approved if the applicant
demonstrates that its planting will achieve, at the end of the fifth year
after initial planting, comparable or better mitigation results as the
results that would be achieved if the applicant complied with all of the
requirements of § 17.5.035D. Such determination shall take into
consideration all of the information required to be submitted under §
17.5.040C.1.



        3.   Mitigation approved under this § 17.5.040C. shall be
subject to the requirements of §§ 17.5.035D.4. through 17.5.035D.9., and it
is recommended that such mitigation also follow the practices recommended in
§ 17.5.035D.10.



   D.   Discretionary review. An applicant seeking discretionary
approval to undertake any development activity within a NRA that does not
comply with § 17.5.035 and is not described in §§ 17.5.040A., B. or C. may
file an application under § 17.5.040D.



      1.   Application requirements. The applicant shall provide all
items described in § 17.5.015 and the following, except that for utility
projects undertaken by public utilities across property that is not owned by
the utility, the utility shall not be required to map or provide any
information about the property except for the area within 300 feet of the
location of the proposed disturbance area of the utility’s project:



         a.   Impact evaluation and alternatives analysis. An
impact evaluation and alternatives analysis is required to determine
compliance with the approval criteria and to evaluate development
alternatives for a particular property. The alternatives must be evaluated on
the basis of their impact on the NRA, the ecological functions provided by
the NRA on the property, and off-site impacts within the subwatershed (6th
Field Hydrologic Unit Code) where the property is located. The impact
evaluation shall include all of the following items:



            i.   Identification of the ecological functions of
riparian habitat found on the property as described in Table 5-5 of this
section and the habitat connectivity ecological functions described in §
17.5.040D.1.a.ii.3. and 4.



            ii.   For upland habitat in areas to be added to
the Metro urban growth boundary areas after October 1, 2005, identification
of the impact the proposed development would have on the following ecological
functions provided by upland wildlife habitat:



               (1)   Habitat patch size;



               (2)   Interior habitat;



               (3)   Connectivity of the habitat to water;
and



               (4)   Connectivity of the habitat to other
habitat areas.



            iii.   Evaluation of alternative locations, design
modifications, or alternative methods of development to determine which
options reduce the significant detrimental impacts on the NRAs and the
ecological functions provided on the property. At a minimum, the following
approaches must be considered:



               (1)   The techniques described in §
17.5.035A.;



               (2)   Multi-story construction;



               (3)   Minimizing building and development
footprint;



               (4)   Maximizing the use of native
landscaping materials; and



               (5)   Minimal excavation foundation systems
(e.g., pier, post or piling foundation).



            iv.   Determination of the alternative that best
meets the applicable approval criteria and identification of significant
detrimental impacts that is unavoidable.

3. “Other water body” could include lakes, ponds, reservoirs or manmade
water feature that is not a water quality facility or farm pond.




 



         b.   Mitigation Plan. The purpose of a mitigation plan
is to compensate for unavoidable significant detrimental impacts to
ecological functions that result from the chosen development alternative as
identified in the impact evaluation. However, when development occurs within
delineated wetlands, then the mitigation required under § 17.5.040D.2.d.
shall not require any additional mitigation than the mitigation required by
state and federal law for the fill or removal of such wetlands.



            i.   An applicant may choose to develop a
mitigation plan consistent with the requirements of § 17.5.035D. If an
applicant so chooses, then the applicant shall submit a mitigation plan
demonstrating such compliance.



            ii.   If an applicant chooses to develop an
alternative mitigation plan that would not comply with the requirements of §
17.5.035D., including, for example, a proposal to create an alternative plant
community type such as an oak savannah or a low-structure plant community, or
where an applicant demonstrates that a portion of identified NRA on its
property provides only impaired ecological functions, then the applicant
shall submit a mitigation plan that includes all of the following:



               (1)   An explanation of how the proposed
mitigation will adequately compensate for the impacts to ecological functions
described in the impact evaluation required by § 17.5.040D.1.a. The
applicant may use the mitigation that would be required under § 17.5.035D.
as the baseline mitigation required to compensate for disturbance to a NRA
that provides an average level of ecological functions. Such explanation
shall include:



                  (a)   If the applicant uses the
mitigation that would be required under § 17.5.035D. as the base-line
mitigation required to compensate for disturbance to a NRA, then the
applicant shall submit a calculation of the number of trees and shrubs the
applicant would be required to plant under § 17.5.035D.;



                  (b)   A site plan showing where the
specific mitigation activities will occur and the numbers and sizes of trees
and shrubs that the applicant proposes to plant; and



                  (c)   A discussion of plant diversity,
plant spacing, site preparation including removal of invasive and noxious
vegetation and soil additives, planting season and immediate post-planting
care including mulching, irrigation, wildlife protection and weed control.



               (2)   Documentation of coordination with
appropriate local, regional, special district, state and federal regulatory
agencies.



               (3)   A list of all responsible parties.



               (4)   The applicant’s mitigationsite
monitoring and reporting plan.



               (5)   If the proposed mitigation will not be
conducted on-site, the applicant shall submit a map and accompanying
narrative that details the following:



                  (a)   The number of trees and shrubs
that can be planted on-site;



                  (b)   The on-site location where those
trees and shrubs can be planted;



                  (c)   An explanation of why it is not
practicable for the remainder of the mitigation to occur on-site; and



                  (d)   The proposed location for
off-sitemitigation and documentation that the applicant can carry out and
ensure the success of the mitigation, including documentation that the
applicant possesses legal authority to conduct and maintain the mitigation,
such as having a sufficient ownership interest in the mitigationsite, and, if
the mitigation is not within a NRA, documentation that the mitigationsite
will be protected after the monitoring period expires, such as through the
use of a restrictive covenant.



               (6)   If the mitigation area is off-site and
not within the same subwatershed (6th Field Hydrologic Unit Code) as the
related disturbed NRA, the applicant shall submit an explanation of why it is
not practicable to conduct the mitigation within the same subwatershed and of
why and how, considering the purpose of the mitigation, the mitigation will
provide more ecological functional value if implemented outside of the
subwatershed.



               (7)   An implementation schedule, including
timeline for construction, mitigation, mitigation maintenance, monitoring,
reporting and a contingency plan. If the applicant is proposing any in-stream
work in fish-bearing streams as part of the mitigation project, then the
applicant shall submit documentation that such work will be done in
accordance with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in-stream work
timing schedule.



         c.   The Impact Evaluation and Alternatives Analysis
required by § 17.5.040D.1.a. and the Mitigation Plan required by §
17.5.040D.1.b. shall be prepared and signed by either: (A) a knowledgeable
and qualified natural resource professional, such as a wildlife biologist,
botanist or hydrologist; or (B) a civil or environmental engineer registered
in Oregon to design public sanitary or storm systems, stormwater facilities
or other similar facilities. The application shall include a description of
the qualifications and experience of all persons that contributed to the
Impact Evaluation and Alternatives Analysis and to the Mitigation Plan, and,
for each person that contributed, a description of the elements of such
reports to which the person contributed.



      2.   Approval criteria.



         a.   Requirements. All application requirements in §
17.5.040D.1. shall be met.



         b.   Avoid.  An applicant shall first avoid the
intrusion of development into the NRA to the extent practicable. The
development that is proposed must have less detrimental impact to NRAs than
other practicable alternatives, including significantly different practicable
alternatives that propose less development within NRAs. If there is more than
one type of NRA on a property then the applicant shall first avoid the
intrusion of development into the higher-valued NRA, to the extent
practicable, and the development that is proposed must have less detrimental
impact to the higher-valued NRAs than other practicable alternatives. To
avoid development in NRAs, and to the extent practicable, applicants shall
use the approaches described in § 17.5.040D.1.a.iii.



         c.   Minimize. If the applicant demonstrates that there
is no practicable alternative that will not avoid disturbance of the NRA,
then the development proposed by the applicant within the NRA shall minimize
detrimental impacts to the extent practicable. If there is more than one type
of NRA on a property then the development within higher-valued NRAs shall be
considered more detrimental than development within lower-valued NRAs.



            i.   Development must minimize detrimental impacts
to ecological functions and loss of habitat consistent with uses allowed by
right under the base zone, to the extent practicable;



            ii.   To the extent practicable within the NRA,
the proposed development shall be designed, located and constructed to:



               A.   Minimize grading, removal of native
vegetation and disturbance and removal of native soils by using the
approaches described in § 17.5.035B.2., reducing building footprints, and
using minimal excavation foundation systems (e.g., pier, post or piling
foundation);



               B.   Minimize adverse hydrological impacts
on water resources such as by using the techniques described in Part (a) of
Table 8-1 in § 17.8.355, unless their use is prohibited by an applicable and
required State or Federal permit issued to a unit of local government having
jurisdiction in the area, such as a permit required under the federal Clean
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§1251 et seq., or the Federal Safe Drinking Water
Act, 42 U.S.C. §§300f et seq., and including conditions or plans required
by such permit;



               C.   Minimize impacts on wildlife corridors
and fish passage such as by using the techniques described in Part (b) of
Table 8-1 of § 17.8.355; and



               D.   Consider using the techniques described
in Part (c) of Table 8-1 of § 17.8.355 to further minimize the impacts of
development in the NRA.



         d.   Mitigate. If the applicant demonstrates that there
is no practicable alternative that will not avoid disturbance of the NRA,
then development must mitigate for adverse impacts to the NRA. All proposed
mitigation plans must meet the following standards.



            i.   The mitigation plan shall demonstrate that it
compensates for detrimental impacts to ecological functions provided by NRAs,
after taking into consideration the applicant efforts to minimize such
detrimental impacts through the use of the techniques described in Table 8-1
in § 17.8.355 and through any additional or innovative techniques. A
mitigation plan that requires the amount of planting that would be required
under § 17.5.035D. based on the amount of proposed disturbance area within
the NRA, and that otherwise complies with all of the mitigation requirements
in §§ 17.5.035D., shall be considered to have satisfied the requirements of
§ 17.5.040D.2.d.



            ii.   Mitigation shall occur on the site of the
disturbance, to the extent practicable. Off-sitemitigation shall be approved
if the applicant has demonstrated that it is not practicable to complete the
mitigation on-site and that the applicant has documented that it can carry
out and ensure the success of the off-sitemitigation, as described in §
17.5.040B.1.b.iii. In addition, if the off-sitemitigation area is not within
the same subwatershed (6th Field Hydrologic Unit Code) as the related
disturbed NRA, the applicant shall demonstrate that it is not practicable to
complete the mitigation within the same subwatershed and that, considering
the purpose of the mitigation, the mitigation will provide more ecological
functional value if implemented outside of the subwatershed. Mitigation shall
not be allowed outside of the Metro jurisdictional boundary.



            iii.   All re-vegetation plantings shall be with
native plants listed on the Metro Native Plan List.



            iv.   All in-stream work in fish-bearing streams
shall be done in accordance with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife
instream work-timing schedule.



            v.   A mitigation maintenance plan shall be
included and shall be sufficient to ensure the success of the planting, and
compliance with the plan shall be a condition of development approval.



         e.   Municipal water utility facilities standards.
Except as provided within this subsection, in addition to all other
requirements of § 17.5.040D.2., municipal potable water, stormwater
(drainage) and wastewater utility facilities may be built, expanded,
repaired, maintained, reconfigured, rehabilitated, replaced or upsized if not
exempted in § 17.5.015. These facilities may include but are not limited to
water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants, raw water intakes, pump
stations, transmission mains, conduits or service lines, terminal storage
reservoirs, and outfall devices provided that:



            i.   Such projects shall not have to comply with
the requirements of § 17.5.040D.2.b., provided that, where practicable, the
project does not encroach closer to a water feature than existing operations
and development, or for new projects where there are no existing operations
or development, that the project does not encroach closer to a water feature
than practicable;



            ii.   Best management practices will be employed
that accomplish the following:



               (1)   Account for watershed assessment
information in project design;



               (2)   Minimize the trench area and tree
removal within the NRA;



               (3)   Utilize and maintain erosion controls
until other site stabilization measures are established, post-construction;



               (4)   Replant immediately after backfilling
or as soon as effective;



               (5)   Preserve wetland soils and retain soil
profiles;



               (6)   Minimize compactions and the duration
of the work within the NRA;



               (7)   Complete in-water construction during
appropriate seasons, or as approved within requisite federal or state permits;



               (8)   Monitor water quality during the
construction phases, if applicable; and



               (9)   Implement a full inspection and
monitoring program during and after project completion, if applicable.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.045  VARIANCES.



   A.   The purpose of this section is to ensure that compliance with
the Natural Resource Area (NRA) provisions do not cause unreasonable
hardship. To avoid such instances, the requirements for NRA may be varied.
Variances are also allowed when strict application of this ordinance would
deprive an owner of all economically viable use of land. 



   B.   This variance provision only applies to NRA as regulated by
this chapter. All other variances for other provisions of this Code are
subject to the requirements of §§ 17.2.700 et seq. 



   C.   This section applies in addition to the standards governing
proposals to vary the requirements of the base zone.



   D.   Notice of varianceapplications shall be provided:



      1.   Upon receiving an application to vary the requirements of
these NRA provisions, the notice shall be provided to all property owners
within 300 feet of the subject property inside the urban growth boundary, and
within 500 feet of the subject property outside the urban growth boundary, to
Metro, to any neighborhood or community planning organization recognized by
the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and whose boundaries include the
property. Notice shall be sent out 14 days prior to any decision.



      2.   The variance request shall be reviewed and acted upon by
the person or board or commission responsible for reviewing compliance with
the overall NRA provisions.



      3.   Within seven days of a decision on the variance, notice
of the decision shall be provided to Metro, to any neighborhood or community
planning organization recognized by the governing body and whose boundaries
include the property, and to any watershed council recognized by the Oregon
Watershed Enhancement Board and whose boundaries include the property, and to
any other person required to receive notice of such a decision under state
law.



   E.   Hardship variance. Variances to avoid unreasonable hardship
caused by the strict application of this Code are permitted subject to the
criteria set forth in this section. To vary from the requirements of this
Code, the applicant must demonstrate the following:



      1.   The variance is the minimum necessary to allow the
proposed use or activity;



      2.   Unless the proposed variance is from mitigation under §
17.5.035E. or mitigation under § 17.5.040B., C. or D.1.b. and D.2.d., the
proposed use will comply with those standards, as applicable; and



      3.   The proposed use complies with the standards of the base
zone.



   F.   Buildable lotvariance. A variance to avoid the loss of all
economically viable use of a lot that is partially inside a NRA is permitted.
Applicants must demonstrate the following:



      1.   Without the proposed variance, the applicant would be
denied economically viable use of the subject property.  To meet this
criterion, the applicant must show that:



         a.   The proposed use cannot meet the standards in §
17.5.045E. (hardshipvariance); and



         b.   No other application could result in permission for
an economically viable use of the subject property.  Evidence to meet this
criterion shall include a list of uses allowed on the subject property.



      2.   The proposed variance is the minimum necessary to allow
for the requested use;



      3.   The proposed variance will comply with §§ 17.5.035E.,
or 17.5.040B., C. or D.1.b and D.2.d. (mitigation); and



      4.   The proposed use complies with the standards of the base
zone.



   G.   Variance conditions. Conditions may be imposed to limit any
adverse impacts that may result from granting any variance.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.050  MAP ADMINISTRATION AND NRA VERIFICATION.



   A.   Exempt development. Development that is outside of any NRA and
no closer than 100 feet to the border of an NRA (including all impervious
surfaces and landscaping), based on the NRA map, may proceed without having
to comply with this section or any other portion of this Code except for §
17.5.030, Construction Management Plan. 



   B.   Verification of the location of NRAs as described in this
section shall not be considered a comprehensive plan or zoning amendment. 



   C.   Map verification is available to correct for mistakes in the
location of NRAs on properties. Map verification shall not be used to dispute
whether identified NRAs provide the ecological functions that they are
assumed to provide based on the ecological criteria used to identify them. If
an applicant believes that a properly identified NRA does not provide the
ecological functions that it has been identified as providing, then the
applicant may use the discretionary review process to decrease its mitigation
responsibilities for disturbing such an area.



   D.   Except for applicants seeking approval to undertake any exempt
activities or conditioned uses described in § 17.5.015, the map verification
requirements described in this § 17.5.050 shall be met at the time an
applicant requests a building permit, grading permit, tree removal permit,
land division approval, or some other land use decision. A property owner, or
another person with the property owner’s consent, may request to verify the
location of NRAs on a real property lot or parcel pursuant to this §
17.5.050 at other times, but whether the city processes such request shall be
at the Community Development Director’s sole discretion, based on staff
availability, funding resources and policy priorities. If a person receives
verification separate from a simultaneous request for a building permit,
grading permit, tree removal permit, land division approval or some other
land use decision, then the person may use the verification to satisfy the
requirements of this section at any time up until five years after the date
the verification was issued.



   E.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this § 17.5.050, for
utility projects undertaken by public utilities across property that is not
owned by the utility, the utility shall not be required to map or provide any
information about the property except for the area within 300 feet of the
location of the proposed disturbance area of the utility’s project.



   F.   Basic verification approaches. The basic verification
approaches described in § 17.5.050F.1. through 3. are available for
applicants who believe either: (A) that the NRA map is accurate; (B) that
there is a simple incongruity between the NRA map and the boundary lot lines
of a property; or (C) that the property was developed prior to March 9, 2009.



      1.   Applicant believes NRA map is accurate. An applicant who
believes that the NRA map is accurate may comply with § 17.5.050F.1. The
applicant shall submit the following information regarding the real property
lot or parcel:



         a.   A detailed property description;



         b.   A copy of the applicable NRA map;



         c.   A summer 2005 aerial photograph of the property,
with lot lines shown, at a scale of at least one map inch equal to 50 feet
for lots of 20,000 or fewer square feet, and a scale of one map inch equal to
100 feet for larger lots (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600
NE Grand Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232; 503-797-1742);



         d.   The information required to be submitted under §§
17.5.035 or 17.5.040 if the applicant proposes development within any NRA
under those provisions; and



         e.   Any other information that the applicant wishes to
provide to support the assertion that the NRA map is accurate.



      2.   Obvious misalignment between mapped habitat and property
lot lines. In some cases, the mapped vegetative cover layer in the GIS
database might not align precisely with the tax lot layer that shows property
lines, resulting in a NRA map that is also misaligned with tax lot lines. An
applicant who believes that the NRA map is inaccurate based on such an
obvious misalignment may comply with this § 17.5.050F.2. The applicant shall
submit the following information regarding the real property lot or parcel: 



         a.   The information described in §§ 17.5.050F.1.a.
through d.; and



         b.   A documented demonstration of the misalignment
between the NRA map and the property’s tax lot boundary lines. For example,
an applicant could compare the boundary lot lines shown for roads within 500
feet of a property with the location of such roads as viewed on the aerial
photograph of the area surrounding a property to provide evidence of the
scale and amount of incongruity between the NRA maps and the property lot
lines, and the amount of adjustment that would be appropriate to accurately
depict habitat on the property.



      3.   Property developed between Summer 2002 and January 5,
2006. Where a property was developed between the summer of 2002 (when the
aerial photo used to determine the regional habitat inventory was taken) and
January 5, 2006, the applicant shall submit the following information
regarding the real property lot or parcel:



         a.   The information described in §§ 17.5.050F.1.a.
through d.;



         b.   A summer 2002 aerial photograph of the property,
with lot lines shown, at a scale of at least one map inch equal to 50 feet
for lots of 20,000 or fewer square feet, and a scale of one map inch equal to
100 feet for larger lots (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600
NE Grand Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232; 503-797-1742);



         c.   Any approved building permits or other development
plans and drawings related to the development of the property that took place
between summer 2002 and January 5, 2006; and



         d.   A clear explanation and documentation, such as
supporting maps or drawings or an more recent aerial photograph, indicating
the new development that has occurred and where previously identified habitat
no longer exists because it is now part of a developed area.



      4.   Decision process. The Community Development Director ’s
map verification decision made pursuant to this § 17.5.050F. may be an
administrative decision. The Director ’s decision shall be based on
consideration of the information submitted by the applicant , any information
collected during a site visit to the lot or parcel, any information generated
by prior map verifications that have occurred on adjacent properties, and any
other objective factual information that has been provided to the Director .



   G.   Detailed verification approach. All applicants who believe that
the NRA map is inaccurate for a reason other than as described in §§
17.5.050F.2. and 3. may file a verification request consistent with this §
17.5.050G.



      1.   Application requirements. The applicant shall submit a
report prepared and signed by either: (A) a knowledgeable and qualified
natural resource professional, such as a wildlife biologist, botanist or
hydrologist; or (B) a civil or environmental engineer registered in Oregon to
design public sanitary or storm systems, stormwater facilities or other
similar facilities. Such report shall include:



         a.   A description of the qualifications and experience
of all persons that contributed to the report, and, for each person that
contributed, a description of the elements of the analysis to which the
person contributed;



         b.   The information described in §§ 17.5.050F.1.a.
through e.;



         c.   The information described in §§ 17.5.050F.2.b.
and 17.5.050F.3.b. through d., if the applicant believes such information is
relevant to the verification of habitat location on the subject lot or parcel;



         d.   Additional aerial photographs if the applicant
believes they provide better information regarding the property, including
documentation of the date and process used to take the photos and an
expert’s interpretation of the additional information they provide;



         e.   A map showing the topography of the property shown
by contour lines of two-foot intervals for slopes less than 15% and by
ten-foot intervals for slopes 15% or greater; and



         f.   Any additional information necessary to address
each of the verification criteria in § 17.5.050G.4., a description of where
any NRAs are located on the property based on the application of the
verification criteria in § 17.5.050G.4., and factual documentation to
support the analysis.



      2.   Notice requirements. Upon receipt of a completed
application pursuant to this § 17.5.050G., the Community Development
Director shall provide notice of the map verification application to Metro,
to the owners of record of property on the most recent property tax
assessment roll where such property is located within 300 feet of the subject
property, to any neighborhood or community planning organization recognized
by the governing body and whose boundaries include the property, and to any
watershed council recognized by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and
whose boundaries include the property. The notice provided by the
jurisdiction shall comply with the notice requirements of O.R.S. 197.763. The
Community Development Director shall accept written public comments regarding
the matter during a public comment period.



      3.   Decision process. The Community Development Director
shall apply the verification criteria in § 17.5.050G.4. to confirm the
location of any NRAs based on the NRA map, the information submitted by the
applicant , any information received during the public comment period, and
any additional information readily available, including information collected
during a site visit to the lot or parcel.  The applicant and all persons
that submitted written comments shall be provided with a written explanation
of the Community Development Director ’s decision.



      4.   Verification criteria. The verification of the location
of NRAs shall be according to the four-step process described in this §
17.5.050G.4. A verification application shall not be considered complete and
shall not be granted unless all the information required to be submitted with
the verification application has been received.



         a.   Step 1. Verifying boundaries of inventoried
riparian habitat. Locating habitat and determining its riparian habitat class
is a four-step process:



            i.   Locate the Water Feature that is the basis
for identifying riparian habitat. 



               (1)   Locate the top of bank of all streams,
rivers and open water within 200 feet of the property.



               (2)   Locate all flood areas within 100 feet
of the property.



               (3)   Locate all wetlands within 150 feet of
the property based on the Local Wetland Inventory map (if completed) and on
the Metro 2002 Wetland Inventory Map (available from the Metro Data Resource
Center, 600 NE Grand Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232). Identified wetlands
shall be further delineated consistent with methods currently accepted by the
Oregon Division of State Lands and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.



            ii.   Identify the vegetative cover status of all
areas on the property that are within 200 feet of the top of bank of streams,
rivers and open water, are wetlands or are within 150 feet of wetlands, and
are flood areas and within 100 feet of flood areas.



               (1)   Vegetative cover status shall be as
identified on the Metro Vegetative Cover Map (available from the Metro Data
Resource Center, 600 NE Grand Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232). 



               (2)   The vegetative cover status of a
property may be adjusted only if (1) the property was developed prior to the
time the regional program was approved (see § 17.5.050F.3. above), or (2) an
error was made at the time the vegetative cover status was determined. To
assert the latter type of error, applicants shall submit an analysis of the
vegetative cover on their property using summer 2002 aerial photographs and
the definitions of the different vegetative cover types provided in §§
17.12.200 et seq.



            iii.  Determine whether the degree that the land
slopes upward from all streams, rivers and open water within 200 feet of the
property is greater than or less than 25% (using the methodology as described
in Chapter 3 of CWS Design and Construction Standards; and



            iv.   Identify the riparian habitat classes
applicable to all areas on the property using Table 5-6 and the data
identified in §§ 17.5.050G.4.a.i. through iii.



         b.   Step 2.  Verifying boundaries of inventoried
upland habitat in future urban growth boundary expansion areas. Upland
habitat was identified based on the existence of contiguous patches of forest
canopy, with limited canopy openings. The “forest canopy” designation is
made based on analysis of aerial photographs, as part of determining the
vegetative cover status of land within the region. Upland habitat shall be as
identified on the NRA map unless corrected as provided in this subsection.



            i.   Except as provided in § 17.5.050G.4.a.ii.,
vegetative cover status shall be as identified on the Metro Vegetative Cover
Map used to inventory habitat at the time the area was brought within the
urban growth boundary (available from the Metro Data Resource Center, 600 NE
Grand Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232).



            ii.   The only allowed corrections to the
vegetative cover status of a property are as follows: 



               A.   To correct errors made when the
vegetative status of an area was determined based on analysis of the aerial
photographs used to inventory the habitat at the time the area was brought
within the urban growth boundary. For example, an area may have been
identified as “forest canopy” when it can be shown that such area has
less than 60% canopy crown closure, and therefore should not have been
identified as “forest canopy.” The perimeter of an area delineated as
“forest canopy” on the Metro Vegetative Cover Map may be adjusted to more
precisely indicate the drip line of the trees within the canopied area
provided that no areas providing greater than 60% canopy crown closure are
de-classified from the “forest canopy” designation.  To assert such
errors, applicants shall submit an analysis of the vegetative cover on their
property using the aerial photographs that were used to inventory the habitat
at the time the area was brought within the urban growth boundary and the
definitions of the different vegetative cover types provided in §§

               B.   To remove tree orchards and Christmas
tree farms from inventoried habitat; provided, however, that Christmas tree
farms where the trees were planted prior to 1975 and have not been harvested
for sale as Christmas trees shall not be removed from the habitat inventory.



            iii.   If the vegetative cover status of any area
identified as upland habitat is corrected pursuant to § 17.5.050G.4.b.ii.1.
to change the status of an area originally identified as “forest canopy,”
then such area shall not be considered upland habitat unless it remains part
of a forest canopy opening less than one acre in area completely surrounding
by an area of contiguous forest canopy.

1. The vegetative cover type assigned to any particular area was based on two
factors:  the type of vegetation observed in aerial photographs and the size
of the overall contiguous area of vegetative cover to which a particular
piece of vegetation belonged. As an example of how the categories were
assigned, in order to qualify as “forest canopy” the forested area had to
be part of a larger patch of forest of at least one acre in size.


2. Areas that have been identified as habitats of concern, as designated on
the Metro Habitats of Concern Map (on file in the Metro Council office),
shall be treated as Class I riparian habitat areas in all cases, subject to
the provision of additional information that establishes that they do not
meet the criteria used to identify habitats of concern as described in
Metro’s Technical Report for Fish and Wildlife. Examples of habitats of
concern include: Oregon white oak woodlands, bottomland hardwood forests,
wetlands, native grasslands, riverine islands or deltas, and important
wildlife migration corridors.

TREE PROTECTION



§ 17.5.100  PURPOSE.



   The trees of Forest Grove, a reminder of the city’s namesake, offer
historic, aesthetic, spiritual, social, environmental and monetary values to
the community. This subarticle of the Code establishes guidelines, a legal
framework and authority for the community forestry program. The intent of
this subarticle is to enhance the quality of life in Forest Grove by
promoting good stewardship that will ensure the continued health of the
community forest. The Development Code creates a protected status for trees
as listed below:



   A.   StreetTrees: Any woody perennial plant permitted by the city to
be planted in the public right-of-way. Typically a one and three-fourths inch
or larger nursery stock tree.



   B.   Natural Resource Vegetation: Trees and vegetation within
sensitive lands or vegetative corridors as required by Clean Water Services
Design and Construction Standards.



   C.   Trees on Developable Land: Trees which have a diameter of six
inches or larger, or Oregon White Oaks with a diameter of three inches or
larger, measured at four and one-half feet above natural grade, on land
subject to or undergoing development review.  Development review includes
site review, design review, partition or subdivision review or building
permit review.



   D.   Trees on approved site plan: Existing trees shown on site plans
and designated for protection as part of the site plan approval.



   E.   Register Trees:  Trees placed on the register list (includes
tree groves) as described in § 35.096 of the Municipal Code. Register trees
may include trees from any of the above categories as well as trees on
private property.



   Where any tree fits into more than one category, the most restrictive
criteria apply.

§ 17.5.110  CITY APPROVAL REQUIRED.



   A.   In no case can trees within the public right-of-way that are
deemed by the city to be healthy and pose no risk of property damage or
personal injury be removed or topped. In addition, unless approved by a tree
permit or specifically exempted under § 17.5.110C. below, it shall be
unlawful within any one year to modify protected trees included in §
17.5.100 as follows:



      1.   Remove or prune as to remove over 20% of a tree’s
canopy;



      2.   Top a tree; or



      3.   Disturb over 10% of the critical root zone of any
protected tree or vegetation except in accordance with the provisions of this
Code.



   B.   Permit requirements.



      1.   The applicant shall file an application for protected
tree removal or pruning with the city.  The application shall include
information on the location and size of the parcel, the location, type and
size of the tree or  proposed for removal or pruning, and the reasons for
the request. Where specified by this Code, a tree protection plan shall be
provided in accordance with the provisions of § 17.5.120.  The application
and reasons shall address appropriate criteria based on the categories in
described in § 17.5.100 (i.e., streettrees, trees on developable land, etc.).



      2.   Where an application involves infested tree(s), the
application shall contain an analysis of the tree(s) by an arborist.



      3.   The Director shall determine whether the request is valid
under the terms of this Code within four working days of submittal of the

Forestry Commission (CFC).



      4.   Applications for the removal or pruning of trees pursuant
to § 17.5.125 shall be submitted as part of the land use permit application
or grading permit, whichever is first. The application shall be reviewed and
acted upon by the Community Forestry Commission prior to the issuance of any
land use approval for new development or grading permit. Notice will be sent
consistent with the Type II procedures with appeal to the City Council.



   C.   Permit exemption. The following activities do not require a
permit.



      1.   Imminent danger. If an imminent danger exists to the
public or any property owner or occupant, the city may issue an emergency
removal permit. The removal shall be in accordance with accepted
arboricultural standards and be the minimum necessary to eliminate the danger.



      2.   Penalty for incorrect danger assessment. If it is
determined that imminent danger did not exist or that the hazardous condition
had existed for over 60 days and the owner delayed in applying for a permit,
mitigation shall be required as established in § 17.5.145 of this Code.



      3.   Maintenance. Regular maintenance which does not require
removal of over 20% of the tree ’s canopy , tree topping or disturbance of
over 10% of the root system.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)

§ 17.5.120  STREET TREES (TREES IN PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY).



   A.   Standards and requirements.



      1.   Streettrees required. All development projects fronting
on a public or private street more than 100 feet in length approved after the
adoption of this title shall be required to plant street trees .



      2.   Streettree planting list. Certain trees can severely
damage utilities, streets and sidewalks or can cause personal injury.
Approval of any planting list shall be subject to review by the Director .



      3.   Tree plan required. New street trees shall conform to an
existing tree plan unless a specific exception is granted. When a tree plan
does not exist, the city shall determine tree species. In selection of tree
species, the city shall consider the list of prohibited trees , the available
planting area, above or below ground restrictions, the need for tree
diversity, and the requests of adjacent property owners.



      4.   Size and spacing of streettrees. The specific spacing of
street trees by size of tree shall be as follows.



         a.   Small or narrow-stature trees under 25 feet tall
and less than 16 feet wide branching at maturity shall be spaced no greater
than 20 feet apart.

wide branching at maturity shall be spaced no greater than 40 feet apart.



         d.   Except for signalized intersections, trees shall
not be planted closer than 20 feet from a street intersection, nor closer
than two feet from private driveways (measured at the back edge of the
sidewalk), fire hydrants or utility poles to maintain visual clearance.



         e.   No new utility pole location shall be established
closer than five feet to any existing streettree.



         f.   Streettrees shall not be planted closer than 20
feet to light standards.



         g.   Where there are overhead power lines, the
streettree species selected shall be of a type which, at full maturity, will
not interfere with the lines.



         h.   Streettrees shall not be planted within two feet of
any permanent hard surface paving or walkway:



            i.   Space between the tree and the hard surface
may be covered by a nonpermanent hard surface such as grates, bricks on sand,
paver blocks and cobblestones; and



            ii.   Sidewalk cuts in concrete for tree planting
shall be at least four feet by four feet to allow for air and water into the
root area.



      5.   Pruning requirements.Trees or shrubs within any public
right-of-way, or on public and private grounds and having branches projecting
into the public street or sidewalk, shall be kept pruned by the owner or
owners of property adjacent to or in front of which such trees , shrubs or
plants are growing and shall meet the following:



         a.   At least eight feet of clearance above sidewalks,
13 feet above local streets, and 15 feet above collector and arterial street
roadway surfaces shall be provided.



         b.   The branches of any tree, shrub or other vegetation
shall be pruned so as to maintain the clear vision area requirements as set
forth in § 17.8.150.



         c.   Newly planted trees may remain untrimmed, provided
they do not interfere with street traffic or persons using the sidewalk.



      6.   Cut and fill around existing trees. Existing trees may be
used as street trees if no cutting or filling takes place within the drip
line of the tree .



      7.   Granting of adjustments. Adjustments to the street tree
requirements may be granted by the Director by means of a Type I or II
procedure, using approval criteria in Article 2 for Adjustments.



      8.   Streettree maintenance – property owner responsibility.



         a.   The adjacent property owner shall appropriately
water the tree for two years following planting, unless a city irrigation
system, maintenance program, or separate maintenance contract is developed
which specifically removes the property owner of this responsibility.



         b.   Pruning requirements. Trees or shrubs within any
public right-of-way, or on public and private grounds and having branches
projecting into the public street or sidewalk, shall be kept pruned according
to city standards by the owner or owners of property adjacent to or in front
of which such trees, shrubs or plants are growing.



         c.   Where tree roots create hazardous sidewalk
conditions, the owner is responsible for pruning the roots or modifying the
sidewalk to alleviate the hazardous condition.



      9.   City maintenance of streettrees.



         a.   The city may perform pruning on any streettree
within the rights-of-way without a permit if total pruning results in removal
of less than 20% of the crown or disturbance of less than 10% of the root
system. Major pruning of a series of streettrees may be combined in one
permit.



         b.   If the owner or owners, lessees, occupants or
person in charge of the property shall fail and neglect to trim such trees,
shrubs or plants within ten to 45 days after notice, the city shall trim such
trees, shrubs or plants and shall bill the property owner for the cost of the
work. Such trimming by the city shall not relieve such owner, lessee,
occupant or person in charge of responsibility for violation of the Code.



      10.   Additional requirements.



         a.   It shall be unlawful to attach anything to a tree,
or to the support of protection devices of a tree, except that which is used
for support or protection or approved by the city.



         b.   It shall be illegal to remove protective devices
from around a tree, or in any way damage a streettree.



         c.   The applicant shall state when products of pruning
or tree removal will be used for a financial return. The commercial
harvesting of tree products (e.g., harvesting and selling of spring foliage)
shall not be the primary purpose for pruning or cutting streettrees.



         d.   If removal is allowed, the stump shall be removed
to a depth of six inches below the surface of the ground or finish grade of
the street, whichever is of greater depth.



         e.   A tree of at least two-inch or larger caliper size
shall be planted within one year of removal of the streettree.



   B.   Criteria for pruning or removal. The permit for major pruning
or removal shall be granted if any of the following criteria are met.



      1.   The tree is dead or diseased.  This criterion shall not
be used as the sole reason for removal if the cost of curing the disease is
less than one-fourth of the value of the tree.  Criterion 1 is to determine
if major pruning or removal is appropriate, and shall not be used to require
treatment of the tree.



      2.   The tree has become a major nuisance by virtue of damage
to personal property or improvements, either public or private, on the
subject site or adjacent sites, and that the maintenance required to prevent
damage to such improvements or property outweighs the value of the tree to
the community.



      3.   The tree is unsafe to the occupants of the property, an
adjacent property or the general public.



      4.   The removal has been approved as part of a development
project, pursuant to the provisions of § 17.5.135.



      5.   The removal is for a public purpose, and there is no
alternative without significant cost or safety problems.



      6.   The removal is part of a streettree improvement program,
such as improving the streetscape, or improving the age and species diversity
within the city.

§ 17.5.125  TREES IN NATURAL RESOURCE AREAS.



   Modification of any trees within Natural Resource Areas shall comply
with Clean Water Service Design and Construction Standards and, where
applicable, §§ 17.5.050 et seq.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.130  TREES ON DEVELOPABLE LAND, PRIOR TO AND DURING DEVELOPMENT.



   A.   Protected trees prior to development.



      1.   A permit shall be required for the removal or major
pruning for trees six inches or greater in diameter or Oregon White Oaks
three inches or greater in diameter, measured four and one-half feet above
natural grade, or other Protected Trees as defined in this Code. A permit may
cover a tree management plan which specified cutting, pruning and thinning on
a six-month to two-year basis.



   B.   Tree removal criteria. The permit for removal of tree (s) on
developable land shall be granted if any of the following criteria have been
met:



      1.   The tree is dead or diseased. Criterion 1 shall not be
used as the sole reason for removal if the cost of curing the disease is less
than one-fourth of the value of the tree. Criterion 1 is to determine if
major pruning or removal is appropriate, and shall not be used to require
treatment of the tree;



      2.   Removal of the tree is necessary to accomplish a public
purpose, such as the installation of public utilities or provision of public
streets by a public agency. The applicant shall show evidence of alternative
designs; and



      3.   Removal of the tree is for thinning purposes following
accepted arboricultural practices.



   C.   Review standards during development review.



      1.   Prior to the removal of any protected trees a tree permit
is required. If there is a land use or other permit which may result in
modification of the site the tree permit shall be reviewed concurrent with
that other permit and follow the same process.



      2.   Permit requirements. In conjunction with the development
permit requested, the applicant shall include the location, size and species
of all trees subject to this Code. Groves or trees that are to be protected
do not have to be individually delineated; however, the approximate number of
trees in each grove shall be indicated.



      3.   Protection plan. For all trees proposed to be preserved,
the applicant shall submit a protection plan consistent with the provisions
of § 17.5.120. Protected trees shall be identified on landscape plans.



      4.   Review criteria. Protected Trees, as defined in §
17.5.100 shall be preserved unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction
of the reviewing body that removal is necessary as a result of:



         a.   Need to remove trees that pose a safety hazard to
pedestrians, property or vehicular traffic or threaten to cause disruption of
public service; or which pose a safety hazard to persons or buildings;



         b.   Need to remove diseased trees or trees weakened by
age, storm, fire or other injury;



         c.   Need to observe good arboricultural practices;



         d.   Need for access to the buildingsite or immediately
around the proposed structure for construction equipment;



         e.   Need for essential grade changes to implement
safety standards common to standard engineering or architectural practices;



         f.   Surface water drainage and utility installations;



         g.   Locations of driveways, buildings or other
permanent improvements so as to avoid unreasonable economic hardship;



         h.   Compliance with other ordinances or codes; and



         i.   Need to install solar energy equipment. For
criteria d-g above, the applicant shall provide evidence of exploring
alternate designs that would increase tree protection. Removal of register
trees shall also comply with the criteria in § 17.5.145.



      5.   Yardsetback adjustment.



         a.   The Director may authorize adjustments from the
setback requirements of this Code where it can be shown that, owing to
special and unusual circumstance related to a specific property, a proposed
development would result in the removal of trees designated in the Register.
An adjustment to the side, front and/or rearyardsetback by up to 50% may be
authorized if necessary to retain designated Register trees.



         b.   The Director may grant only the minimum adjustment
necessary to retain the designated Register trees. In granting the
adjustment, the Director may attach conditions necessary to protect the
interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood.



   The adjustment to setbacks to protect Register trees shall be
consolidated with the land useapplication and reviewed under the procedures
specified for Adjustments in § 17.2.100.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.135  TREES IN APPROVED DEVELOPMENTS.



   The following provisions apply to trees that were existing and retained
as part of a development review procedure.



   A.   Criteria. The permit for major pruning or removal shall be
granted if any of the following criteria have been met.



      1.   The tree is dead or diseased. Criterion 1 shall not be
used as the sole reason for removal if the cost of curing the disease is less
than one-fourth of the value of the tree. Criterion 1 is to determine if
major pruning or removal is appropriate, and shall not be used to require
treatment of the tree.



      2.   The tree has lost its significance in terms of its
original designation due to damage from natural or accidental causes, or if
some other reason can be established that it is no longer of historic
significance.



      3.   The tree has become a major nuisance by virtue of damage
to personal property or improvements, either public or private, on the
subject site or adjacent sites, and that the maintenance required to prevent
damage to such improvements or property outweighs the value of the tree to
the development.



      4.   The tree is unsafe to the occupants of the property, an
adjacent property or the general public.



      5.   The pruning, removal or replacement of the tree results
in an improved development as measured by the original review criteria. 
Decisions under this provision may be referred to the original review body.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.140  PROTECTION OF REGISTER TREES.



   A.   Register Trees. Register Trees are those identified and adopted
by Council ordinance, and are subject to this section in addition to any
requirements set forth in this article.



   B.   When development is proposed within a significant grove or when
Register trees are located within a site proposed for development, a tree
protection plan pursuant to § 17.5.110 shall be submitted for approval. If
justification for removal is based upon the health of the tree, and a visual
inspection by the city cannot establish that the tree is dead or seriously
diseased, the applicant shall hire a certified arborist or pay a fee
established by the city so that an arborist can be hired to inspect and
evaluate the health of the tree.



   C.   Criteria. The permit for major pruning or removal shall be
granted if any of the following criteria have been met.



      1.   The tree is dead or diseased.  Criterion 1 shall not be
used as the sole reason for removal if the cost of curing the disease is less
than one-fourth of the value of the tree. Criterion 1 is to determine if
major pruning or removal is appropriate, and shall not be used to require
treatment of the tree.



      2.   The tree has lost its significance in terms of its
original designation due to damage from natural or accidental causes, or if
some other reason can be established that it is no longer of historic
significance.



      3.   The tree is unsafe to the occupants of the property, an
adjacent property or the general public.



      4.   The proposed removal is part of a development project; and



         a.   The removal is for a public purpose, and there is
no alternative without significant cost or safety problems as determined by
the CFC; or



         b.   Protecting register trees results in a density
reduction of over 15%, or an increase in costs of 15%. If this is documented,
the allowed tree removal shall be the minimum required to reduce the impact
on density and/or costs to less than 15%.



   D.   Issuance of permit. All permits for removal shall be issued
with the following conditions attached:



      1.   Any Register tree shall be removed or pruned following
professional standards.  These standards shall be provided to all applicants
at the time the permit is issued.

all protected trees are removed or pruned in a manner that ensures safety to
individuals and public and private property.



      3.   Other conditions (such as one or more replacement trees)
shall be attached in keeping with the purpose of this section.



   E.   Relative value. The relative significance and historic value of

§ 17.5.145  MITIGATION AND PENALTIES.



   A.   Tree replacement.  Replacement trees shall be new trees , two
inches in caliper size or larger, meeting city requirements for tree type,
placement, installation and watering provisions.  The owner (or the adjacent
property owner in the case of street trees ) shall be responsible for the
continued health of the new tree including regular watering. Replacement
shall be completed within one year of tree removal.



   B.   Mitigation for improper tree removal.



      1.   Removal or destruction of a tree in violation of this
Code on developed single-family zoned property (and which does not meet the
criteria of developable land) is punishable by replacement of the tree and a
fine. The fine shall not exceed the schedule for fines set forth in the
Municipal Code or the value of the tree, whichever is less.



      2.   In all other cases, removal or destruction of a protected
tree in violation of this Code is punishable by a fine which shall not exceed
the replacement value of the tree as based on the Guide for Plant Appraisal.
In lieu of a cash payment to the city, the city may acceptmitigation of said
value based on the following alternatives, either singularly or in
combination:



         a.   One or more trees resulting in the same or higher
value of the removed tree, except that the value shall be not less than the
cost of tree replacement; and/or



         b.   One or more trees of a species acceptable to the
city in which the caliper size (cumulative square inches) of the replacement
trees equal the diameter measurement at four and one-half feet above natural
grade of the removed trees.



      3.   Mitigation shall be completed within 180 days. The
Director may extend the time for up to 60 days due to extenuating
circumstances (such as hot weather).



      4.   Where it is determined that tree removal was performed
illegally, all land use permit processing for the parcel shall be suspended
until mitigation is complete.



      5.   Partial compliance with criteria. If the required
criteria have only been partially met, then the reviewing body can require
mitigation greater than § 17.5.145A. Tree Replacement but less than §
17.5.145B.

HISTORIC LANDMARKS



§ 17.5.200  PURPOSE.



   Pursuant to the State of Oregon’s enabling legislation (O.R.S.
Chapter 197) and in recognition of the public educational, economic,
environmental and cultural value of the heritage and character of Forest
Grove to the welfare of its citizens, the following sections create a
comprehensive program to identify, designate and protect the history,
culture, archaeology, architecture and landscape of Forest Grove.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.205  HISTORIC LANDMARKS BOARD.



   Sections 35.065 et seq. of the Forest Grove Municipal Code establishes
a Historic Landmarks Board (HLB).



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.210  HISTORIC OR CULTURAL LANDMARK DESIGNATION.



   The procedure and criteria to designate or remove landmarks from the
Forest Grove Register of Historic and Cultural Landmarks is established by
§§ 9.150 et seq. of the Municipal Code.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.5.220  PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF PROPOSED WORK AFFECTING THE EXTERIOR OF
LANDMARKS.



   For the purposes of this section, “historic landmark” or
“landmark” is construed to include “historic contributing building”
as defined in § 17.12.210H.1. These standards apply to:



   ∙   Structures listed on the Forest Grove Register of Historic and
Cultural Landmarks, whether or not they are located within a district;



   ∙   Historic contributing structures within a district;



   ∙   Non-contributing structures within a district; and



   ∙   New development within a district.



   Prior to the commencement of work on the exterior of a landmark
(including repairs, maintenance, alterations, improvements, reconstruction
and/or expansion affecting the exterior appearance of the landmark), an
application describing the proposed work shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department for review. The application shall include plans and
specifications describing proposed materials and methods in sufficient detail
to illustrate the finished results.



   For landmarks within a district, the design intent is to maintain or
better the overall integrity of the district. For new development or
non-contributing buildings there is a similar intent, particularly if the
development would displace an existing landmark.



   The standards in this section apply to the exterior rehabilitation of
buildings within a historic district. Situations include existing historic
contributing buildings, additions or new development within a district, and
to individually-listed historic landmarks located outside of a district.
Certain provisions apply to all properties.



   Two-Track Procedure: Pursuant to § 17.2.350, designs or portions of a
project not meeting, or those requesting an exception to the Standards [Track
1] shall be reviewed under the Guidelines  [Track 2] as described in Design
Guidelines Handbook Section V Historic District Design Guidelines.



   A.   Exempt activities. Replacement of deteriorated materials in
kind, repainting, installation of gutters and leaders and installation of
removable storm windows and demolition of non-contributing buildings shall be
considered allowable without assessment of visual impact.



   B.   Director review.  When the proposed work activities are not
exempt under § 17.5.220A. above, the Director shall review the application
and plans.  If review results in a determination that the work would not
result in visual change, the Director shall provide the applicant with
written approval for the work to proceed.



   Where the proposed work is of such a nature that a building permit is
required, the Building Official shall withhold issuance of a building permit
for the proposed work pending review and approval by the Director. The
Director may require additional plans and application materials beyond those
required for issuance of a building permit. If review results in a
determination that the work would comply with the standards of § 17.5.220D.
below, the Director shall provide the applicant with written approval for the
work to proceed.



   C.   HLB review.



      1.   Where review of the application results in a
determination that the work would not comply with the standards of §
17.5.220D. below, the application shall be forwarded to the HLB for review
and action subject to Type III procedures. Other design elements requiring
HLB review include:



         a.   Relocations or repositionings of a landmark or a
historic contributing building pursuant to § 17.5.225;



         b.   Demolition of a landmark or historic contributing
building pursuant to § 17.5.225;



         c.   Removal of chimneys from a landmark or historic
contributing building; and



         d.   New exterior stairs (except those connected to
ground-floor entries).



      2.   Where the proposed work is of such a nature that a
building permit is required, the Building Official shall withhold issuance of
a building permit for the proposed work pending review and approval by the
HLB. The Board may require additional plans and application materials beyond
those required for issuance of a building permit.



      3.   After reviewing plans and materials, the HLB shall
approve, approve with conditions or reject the proposal subject to Type III
notice procedures and timelines.



   D.   Review standards. In acting on an application submitted
pursuant to this section for work affecting the exterior of a landmark or
construction of a new building within a district, the Director shall approve
the proposal if findings are made demonstrating that the following standards
are met:



      1.   General review standards.



         a.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a
compatible use for the property that requires minimal alteration of the
structure, or to use the property for its originally intended purpose.



         b.   The distinguishing original qualities or character
of the structure shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of
historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be avoided when
possible.



         c.   All structures shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.



         d.   Changes that may have taken place in the history
and development of the structure shall be recognized and respected.



         e.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of
skilled craftsmanship that characterize the structure shall be treated with
sensibility.



         f.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be
repaired if practicable; if not, they should be replaced in kind. Where
replacement of features is proposed, the new material should match the
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other
visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs
or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings
or structures.



         g.   Surface cleaning, if any, of structures shall be
undertaken with the least damaging means. Sandblasting and other cleaning
methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.



         h.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect
and preserve archeological landmarks affected by, or adjacent to the landmark.



         i.   A design for alterations and additions to the
structure shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of
the property, neighborhood and environment.



         j.   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to
structures shall be done in such a manner that, if such additions or
alterations were removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of
the structure would not be impaired.



         k.   Attempts to improve or enhance the exterior
appearance of a landmark by installing decorative features, such as shutters,
shall be avoided unless it can be established that the feature existed on the
landmark at its inception.



      2.   Building and addition placement and orientation.



         a.   Locate the primary building side and entry of the
building to face the public way. This side is typically parallel to the
street. Maintain an orientation similar to that of the neighboring historic
buildings.



         b.   Additions are not allowed on the primary side of a
historic building.

LAND DIVISIONS



§ 17.6.000 OVERVIEW OF ARTICLE 6.



   This article guides what is often the first major step in the
development process, how land is divided into blocks, lots and streets. Land
divisions define the pattern of a community, which in turn may shape the
character of the community. This article establishes the procedures for lot
line adjustments, expedited land divisions, partitions and subdivisions. The
provisions of this article should be read together with the General
Development Standards of Article 8. In particular, the standards for Public
Improvements that are applicable to all development, including land
divisions, are addressed in Article 8.



   Land divisions occur through either a partition or subdivision process.



      A partition procedure is used when three or fewer units
(generally referred to as “parcels”) are created in a calendar year and
may or may not involve creation of a street. Partitions are reviewed through
a two-step process.



      A subdivision is used when four or more units (generally referred
to as “lots”) of land are created in a calendar year. Subdivisions are
also reviewed through a two-step process. Subdivisionapplications may include
a concurrent request for Planned Development (PD) approval to permit greater
flexibility in the design of the subdivision. Provisions for Planned
Developments are addressed in Article4.

(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 17.6.005  INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS.



   Land divisions are governed by state law, several related provisions of
this Code and other chapters of the Forest Grove Municipal Code. An
introduction to these related regulations is provided below.



   A.   Relationship to state law. O.R.S. Chapter 92 governs all land
divisions. State law permits the city to develop its own procedures and
review criteria for land divisions. However, because the state law limits the
city ’s discretion in land divisions, users of this Code are encouraged to
review O.R.S. 92 to be aware of all state requirements applicable to land
divisions. Pursuant to O.R.S. 197.015(10)(b)(G), a city decision to approve
or not approve a final plat is not a land use decision.



   B.   Relationship to public improvements standards in Article 8. All
proposed land divisions must meet the applicable design and construction
standards for public improvements included in Article 8 , and related
construction specifications adopted by the City of Forest Grove separate from
this Code.



   C.   Relationship to other local regulations. All proposed land
divisions must meet the applicable standards of the base zoning district
(i.e., residential, commercial, industrial, etc.), the provisions of any
applicable overlay districts (such as Environmental Review), and other
development standards included in Article 8 (such as Clear Vision Area ,
Grading, Drainage and Erosion Control). A pre-application conference is
required to highlight all of the key provisions of this Code and other
regulations that will apply to the proposed land division application .



   D.   Phased subdivision.



      1.   The review body may authorize a time schedule for
platting a subdivision in phases. Each phase may be for a period of time in
excess of one year, but the total time period for all phases shall not be
more than eight years without resubmission of the tentative plan. Each phase
so platted and developed shall conform to the applicable requirements of this
Code.



      2.   For a phased project, the right-of-way for streets within
the development that provide connectivity to arterials or collectors outside
the project site shall be dedicated with the first phase of the project.



   E.   Prohibition on sale of lots. No person shall sell or convey any
interest in any subdivision or partition lot until the final plat has been
approved and recorded with the recording officer of Washington County.



   F.   Future re-division. When dividing tracts into large lots , the
review authority shall require that the lots be of such size and shape to
facilitate future re-division in accordance with the density targets
established in Article 3.



   G.   A building permit for the construction of a structure shall not
be issued unless all applicable and needed services including vehicular
access, power, sewerage, domestic and fire water supply and stormwater
drainage are available to the lot or parcel where the structure is to be
built. This provision does not apply to permits for a structure that does not
require such services (such as a storage shed).

EXPEDITED LAND DIVISIONS



§ 17.6.010  ALTERNATIVE PROCESS.



   A.   At the request of the applicant, certain land division
applications may be processed as expedited land divisions under the
provisions of O.R.S. 197.360 through 197.380.  In general, the expedited
land division process shall be available as a more expedient means of
processing certain land divisions.



   B.   The provisions of O.R.S. 197.360 shall be followed to determine
the eligibility of an application for the expedited land division process.



   C.   The notice and comment provisions of O.R.S. 197.365 shall apply
to all expedited land division applications.



   D.   While the decision making process is strictly controlled by
statute, the approval standards and criteria shall be the same as those
provided within this Code for the type of permit requested.



   E.   A decision on an expedited land division application must be
reached within 63 days of the application being deemed complete. Decisions on
expedited land division applications shall be made in accordance with the
rules and exceptions on timing as provided in O.R.S. 197.370.



   F.   A decision on an expedited land division application may be
appealed to a hearings referee in accordance with the procedures established
under O.R.S. 197.375. The decision of the hearing referee may be appealed to
the court of appeals.

§ 17.6.030  REVIEW CRITERIA.



   The Director shall approve or deny a lot line adjustment based on the
following criteria:



   A.   An additional parcel is not created by the lot line adjustment,
and the parcel reduced in size by the adjustment is not reduced below the
minimum lot size established by the zoning district; and



   B.   The resulting parcels conform to the dimensional standards of
the zoning district, including:



      1.   The minimum width of the lots shall meet the requirements
of the applicable zoning district; and



      2.   Setbacks shall be as required by the applicable zoning
district.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.6.035  EXEMPTIONS FROM DEDICATIONS.



   A lot line adjustment is not considered a development action for
purposes of determining whether floodplain or right-of-way dedication is
required.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.6.040  RECORDING REQUIREMENTS.



   Upon the Director’s approval of the proposed lot line adjustment, the
applicant shall record the lot line adjustment with Washington County and
submit a copy of the recorded document to the city, to be incorporated into
the record.  The recorded document shall convey property by deed and comply
with the requirements of O.R.S. Chapter 92. The document shall be recorded
prior to the issuance of any building permits on the re-configured lots.



   Approval of the lot line adjustment is evidenced by the signature of
the Director or his or her designee, together with the date of approval. If
the documents effectuating the lot line adjustment as approved are not
properly prepared, executed and recorded with Washington County within six
months following approval, the adjustment shall be null and void. Approval
shall not be reinstated without a new application.

PARTITIONS



§ 17.6.045  PURPOSE.



   Land division review procedures for partitions are established for the
following purposes:



   A.   Ensure buildingsites are of sufficient size and appropriate
design for their intended uses and lots to be created are within density
ranges permitted by the Comprehensive Plan;



   B.   Minimize negative effects of development upon the natural
environment and incorporate natural features into the proposed development
where possible;



   C.   Ensure economical, safe and efficient routes for pedestrians,
bicycles and motor vehicles;



   D.   Create residential living environments that foster a sense of
neighborhood identity and are protected from the adverse effects of heavy
traffic and more intensive land uses; and



   E.   Promote energy efficiency.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.6.050  PROCEDURE.



   Partitions are reviewed through a two-step procedure. A tentative plat
for a partition is reviewed through the Type II procedure primarily for
design aspects, connections to existing and future streets, preservation of
natural features, drainage and floodplain considerations, and compliance with
other requirements of this Code. General compliance with the public
improvement standards of Article 8 is assessed at the tentative partitionplat
review stage. 



   The final partitionplat is reviewed through the Type I procedure for
conformance with the approved tentative plat and conditions, and applicable
state or county laws or rules. Detailed and specific compliance with the
public improvement standards of Article 8 is assessed at the final
partitionplat review stage. An Oregon-licensed land surveyor must prepare the
tentative and final plats.



   Refer to Article 1 for information on Type I and Type II procedures.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)

SUBDIVISIONS



§ 17.6.095  PURPOSE.



   Land division review procedures for subdivision are established for the
following purposes:



   A.   Ensure buildingsites are of sufficient size and appropriate
design for their intended uses and lots to be created are within density
ranges permitted by the Comprehensive Plan;



   B.   Minimize negative effects of development upon the natural
environment and incorporate natural features into the proposed development
where possible;



   C.   Ensure economical, safe and efficient routes for pedestrians,
bicycles and motor vehicles;



   D.   Create residential living environments that foster a sense of
neighborhood identity and are protected from the adverse effects of heavy
traffic and more intensive land uses; and



   E.   Promote energy efficiency.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.6.100  PROCEDURE.



   Subdivisions are reviewed through a two-step procedure. A tentative
plat for a subdivision is reviewed through the Type II procedure primarily
for design aspects, connections to existing and future streets, preservation
and natural features, drainage and floodplain considerations, and compliance
with other requirements of this Code. General compliance with the public
improvement standards of Article 8 is assessed at the tentative plat review
stage. 



   The final subdivisionplat is reviewed through the Type I procedure for
conformance with the approved tentative plat and conditions, and applicable
state or county laws or rules. Detailed and specific compliance with the
public improvement standards of Article 8 is assessed at the final plat
review stage.  An Oregon-licensed land surveyor must prepare the tentative
and final plats.



   Refer to Article 1 for information on Type I and Type II procedures.

   Home occupations are activities that are accessory and incidental to
the primary residential use of a property. Standards ensure that home
occupations will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the
surrounding neighborhood. The home occupation provisions recognize that many
types of jobs can be performed in a home with little or no effects on the
surrounding neighborhood.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)

manufactured home parks are adopted for the following purposes:



   A.   To accommodate manufactured homes as permitted uses in all
residential zones;



   B.   To assist in providing opportunities for low and moderately
priced single-family housing;



   C.   To provide standards to ensure a high-quality environment; and



   D.   To provide standards to protect the character of existing

NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT



§ 17.7.100  PURPOSE.



   Within the zoning districts established by this Code, development that
was lawful at the time it was established, but would be prohibited under the
terms of this Code or future amendments may exist. As used in this section,
NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT includes nonconforming structures and nonconforming
uses.



   A.   A nonconformingstructure is a structure that does not fully
comply with the Code because of setbacks, building height, off-street parking
or with some other standard of the zone. A use shall be deemed to be
discontinued or abandoned upon the occurrence of the first date of any of the
following events:



      1.   When the structure and/or premises are vacated;



      2.   The use ceases to be actively involved in the sale of
merchandise or the provision of services;



      3.   Termination of any lease or contract under which the
non-conforming use has occupied the premises; or



      4.   A request for final reading of water and power meters is
made to the City Support Services Department.



   B.   A nonconforminguse is a use that is not permitted outright or
has not received conditional approval in the zone, but was lawfully
established prior to it becoming nonconforming.



   The purposes of this subarticle are:



   A.   To permit nonconformingdevelopment do continue, but not to
encourage its perpetuation; and



   B.   To ultimately bring nonconformingdevelopment into compliance
with this Code and the Comprehensive Plan.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.7.105  APPLICABILITY.



   The nonconformingdevelopment regulations apply only to those
nonconforming situations that were allowed when established or which were
approved through a land use review. Additionally, they must have been
maintained over time.  These situations have legal nonconforming status.
Nonconforming situations that were not allowed when established or have not
been maintained over time have no legal right to continue and must be removed.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.7.110  LOSS OF NONCONFORMING STATUS.



   A.   Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for more
than one year, the nonconforming rights are lost and the re-establishment of
a nonconforming use is prohibited.



   B.   Accidental destruction.  When a structure containing a
nonconforming use is damaged by fire or other causes beyond the control of
the owner, the reestablishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited if the
repair cost of the structure is more than 60% of its assessed value.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.7.115  ALTERATION OF A NONCONFORMING USE.



   A.   A nonconforminguse shall not be expanded or moved to occupy a
different or greater area of land, buildings or structures than it occupied
at the time it became nonconforming.



   B.   Alteration of a nonconforminguse shall not increase the
nonconforming nature of the use or otherwise create increased impacts on
surrounding properties.



   C.   No building, structure or land area devoted to a
nonconforminguse shall be enlarged, extended, moved or structurally altered
unless such development conforms to the provisions of this Code.



   D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit normal
repair, maintenance and nonstructural alterations to such development, nor
the alteration, strengthening or restoration to safe condition as may be
required by law.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.7.120  ALTERATION OF A NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE.



   Where the use of a structure is permitted by the zoning district but
the structure is nonconforming, an alteration, expansion, enlargement,
extension, reconstruction or relocation may be approved through a Type II
process if the following criteria are met:



   A.   The proposed change, evaluated separately from the existing
structure, would be in compliance with this Code;



   B.   The area of improvement is not within a vision clearance area
as determined by the City Engineer; and



   C.   The change does not increase the nonconforming nature of the
structure, or otherwise create increased impacts on surrounding properties.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.7.125  EXCEPTIONS.



   The following exceptions to the nonconformingdevelopment regulations
are allowed by this Code:



   A.   Existing single-family dwellings, duplexes and manufactured
homes within an existing mobile home park in all commercial and industrial
zones may be reconstructed or replaced within one year after being removed or
destroyed.



   B.   Existing single-family dwellings in the Community Commercial
Zone shall be allowed to enlarge or expand despite their nonconforming
status. They may also be relocated within the Community Commercial Zone, but
only to replace an existing single-family home, provided that the result is a
net reduction of nonconforming uses.



   C.   Existing multi-familydwellings in all residential and
commercial zones may be reconstructed within one year if destroyed by any
cause not intended by the owner.



   D.   Existing nonresidential structures in the Town Center zone
districts may be reconstructed to the same height of the existing building
within one year.



   E.   Any property use that was classified a non-conforming use under
the Forest Grove Zoning Ordinance on December 2, 1982, shall be considered a
permitted use.

(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013; Ord. 2017-01,
passed 4-10-2017)



§ 17.8.135  SPECIAL ACCESS-EGRESS PROVISIONS.



   A.   One-way vehicular access points. Where a proposed parking
facility indicates only one-way traffic flow on the site , it shall be
accommodated by a specific driveway serving the facility; the entrance drive
shall be situated closest to oncoming traffic and the exit drive shall be
situated farthest from oncoming traffic.



   B.   Director’s authority to restrict access. The Director has the
authority to restrict access when the need to do so is required by one or
more of the following conditions:



      1.   To provide for increased traffic movement on congested
streets and to eliminate turning movement problems, the Director may restrict
the location of driveways on streets and require that the location of
driveways be placed on adjacent streets, upon the finding that the proposed
access would:



         a.   Cause or increase existing hazardous traffic
conditions;



         b.   Provide inadequate access for emergency vehicles; or



         c.   Cause hazardous conditions to exist, which would
constitute a clear and present danger to the public health, safety and
general welfare.



      2.   To eliminate the need to use public streets for movements
between commercial or industrial properties, parking areas shall be designed
to connect with parking areas on adjacent properties unless not feasible. The
Director shall require access easements between properties where necessary to
provide for parking area connections.



      3.   To facilitate pedestrian and bicycle circulation, access
and parking area plans shall provide efficient sidewalk and/or a pathway
connection, as feasible, between neighboring developments and land uses.



      4.   A decision by the Director per subsections B.1. through
B.3. above may be appealed by means of a Type II procedure.



   C.   Joint Access in the Community Commercial Zone. If feasible,
joint access and the provision of reciprocal easements shall be required as a
condition of issuing a building permit in the Community Commercial (CC) Zone.



   D.   In all zones where the spacing of access and egress drives
cannot be readily achieved within a particular parcel; joint access with an
adjoining property shall be sought. If the Director is satisfied that
sufficient attempts to secure joint access have been made and the joint
access is not possible, and access separation as specified in § 17.8.130
cannot be maintained, driveway access may be granted with less separation
between adjacent driveways. The spacing shall be the minimum required to
provide adequate, yet safe and convenient access to the property. The clear
vision area requirements of Article 8 are applicable.

pertaining to the provisions of this Code.



   E.   Alteration of watercourses.



      1.   Development shall not diminish the flood-carrying
capacity of a watercourse. If any watercourse will be altered or relocated as
a result of the proposed development, the applicant shall submit
certification by a registered professional engineer that the flood-carrying
capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished.



      2.   The City Engineer shall:



         a.   Notify adjacent communities, the Department of Land
Conservation and Development and other appropriate state and federal
agencies, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration; and



         b.   Require that maintenance is provided within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity is not diminished.



      3.   Applicants shall obtain a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA before any encroachment, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvement or other development, in the regulatory
floodway is permitted. The applicant shall be responsible for preparing
technical data to support the CLOMR application any paying any processing or
application fees to FEMA.



   F.   Requirement to submit new technical data.



      1.   The City Engineer shall:



         a.   Notify FEMA within six months of project completion
when an applicant had obtained a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
from FEMA, or when development altered a watercourse, modified floodplain
boundaries or modified base flood elevations. This notification shall be
provided as a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR); and



         b.   Be under no obligation to sign the Community
Acknowledgment Form, which is part of the CLOMR/LOMR application, until the

technical data to support the LOMR application and paying any processing or
application fees to FEMA.



   G.   Non-conversion of enclosed areas below the lowest floor. To
ensure that enclosed areas below the lowest floor continue to be used solely
for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be
finished for use as human habitation/recreation/bathrooms, etc., the City
Engineer shall:



      1.   Determine which applicants for new construction and/or
substantial improvements have fully-enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are five feet or higher; and



      2.   Require such applicants to enter in a “Non-Conversion
Deed Declaration for Construction within Flood Hazard Areas” or equivalent.
The deed declaration shall be recorded with Washington County and shall be in
a form acceptable to the City Engineer.



   H.   Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. The City Engineer shall make
interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the
areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in § 17.8.330.

§ 17.8.330  VARIANCE PROCEDURE.



   A.   Appeal Board. The Planning Commission shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this Code. The
Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is
an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the City of
Forest Grove in the enforcement or administration of this Code.



   B.   Any affected party may appeal the decision of the Planning
Commission to the City Council, as provided in § 17.1.640.



   C.   In passing upon such applications, the Planning Commission
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this Code, and:



      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;



      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage;



      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;



      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;



      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location,
where applicable;



      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;



      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;



      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and



      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets
and bridges.



   D.   Upon consideration of the factors of § 17.8.330C. and the
purposes of this Code, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this Code.



   E.   The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon
request.



   F.   Conditions for variances.



      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from
the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items (1-11) in § 17.8.330C. have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.



      2.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register
of Historic Places or the Statewide Inventory of Historic Properties, without
regard to the procedures set forth in this section.



      3.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.



      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.



      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:



         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and



         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 17.8.330C., or conflict with
existing local laws or codes.



      6.   Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance
Program are based  on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to
a physical piece or property; they are not personal in nature and do not
pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial
circumstances, they primarily address small lots in densely populated
residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations
should be quite rare.



      7.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in
very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than
watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action
will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria
except § 17.8.330F.1., and otherwise complies with § 17.8.335A.1.3. of the
General Standards.



      8.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor elevation below the base floodd elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.

§ 17.8.335  PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.



   A.   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following standards are required.



      1.   Anchoring.



         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements
shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure.



         b.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using
methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors (Refer to FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard
Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).



      2.   Construction materials and methods.



         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.



         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements
shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.



         c.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed
and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.



      3.   Utilities.



         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system;



         b.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and



         c.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding
consistent with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.



      4.   Subdivision proposals.



         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage;

utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;



         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and



         d.   Where base flood elevation data has not been
provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be
generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which
contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).



      5.   Review of building permits. Where elevation data is not
available either through the Flood Insurance Study , FIRM or from another
authoritative source (§ 17.8.325C.), applications for building permits shall
be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from
flooding . The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of
historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding , etc., where
available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones
may result in higher insurance rates.



   B.   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where
base flood elevation data has been provided (Zones A1-30, AH and AE) as set
forth in § 17.8.315B., Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood
Hazard , or § 17.8.325C., Use of Other Base Flood Data in “A” Zones, the
following provisions are required:



      1.   Residential construction.



         a.   New construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.



         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be either
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet
or exceed the following minimum criteria:



            i.   A minimum of two openings having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.



            ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade.



            iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens,

the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;



         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;



         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection
based on their development and/or review of the structural design,
specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the
official as set forth in § 17.8.320B.3.;



         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not
floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor
as described in § 17.8.335B.1.b.;



         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings
shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that

the base flood level will be rated as one foot below.



         f.   Applicants shall supply a Maintenance Plan for the
entire structure to include but not limited to: exterior envelope of
structure; all penetrations to the exterior of the structure; all shields,
gates, barriers or components designed to provide floodproofing protection to
the structure; all  seals or gaskets for shields, gates, barriers or
components; and, the location of all shields, gates, barriers and components
as well as all associated hardware, and any materials or specialized tools
necessary to seal the  structure.



         g.   Applicants shall supply an Emergency Action Plan
(EAP) for the installation and sealing of the structure prior to a flooding
event that clearly identifies what triggers the EAP and who is responsible
for enacting the EAP.



      4.   Recreational vehicles.Recreational vehicles placed on
sites are required to:



         a.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

         a.   Less than 200 square feet and do not exceed one
story;



         b.   Not temperature controlled;



         c.   Not used for human habitation and are used solely
for parking of vehicles or storage of items having low damage potential when
submerged; not used to store toxic material, oil or gasoline, or any priority
persistent pollutant identified by the Oregon Department of Environmental
Quality unless confined in a tank installed in compliance with this Code or
stored at least one foot above Base Flood Elevation;



         d.   Located and constructed to have low damage
potential;



         e.   Constructed with materials resistant to flood
damage;

including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the base flood; and



         g.   Constructed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified by a licensed
professional engineer or architect or:



            i.   Provide a minimum of two openings with a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;



            ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above the higher of the exterior or interior grade or
floor immediately below the opening;



            iii.   The openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the
automatic flow of floodwater in both directions without manual intervention;
and



            iv.   Be constructed with electrical and other
service facilities located and installed so as to prevent water from entering
or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood.



      6.   Below-grade crawl spaces .Below-grade crawlspaces are
allowed subject to the following standards as found in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 11-01 Crawlspace Construction for Buildings Located in Special Flood
Hazard Areas:



         a.   The building must be designed and adequately
anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be
addressed through the required openings stated in subsection b. below.
Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is not allowed in
areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the
design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered
architect or professional engineer. Other types of foundations are
recommended for these areas.



         b.   The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base
flood elevation (BFE) and, as such, must have openings that equalize
hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one
foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade.



         c.   Portions of the building below the BFE must be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only
the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also
any joists, insulation or other materials that extend below the BFE. The
recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all
insulation above BFE.



         d.   Any building utility systems within the crawlspace
must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or
accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in
particular, must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.



         e.   The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE
must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade.



         f.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured
from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace
foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point. The height limitation
is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering
analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas.



         g.   There must be an adequate drainage system that
removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed
area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type
of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage
characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural
drainage through porous, well- drained soils and drainage systems such as
perforated pipes, drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by
gravity or mechanical means.



         h.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not
exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of
five feet per second, other foundation types should be used. For more
detailed information, refer to FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01.



Figure 8-6: Limitations on Below-Grade Crawlspaces







 



   Residential structures must be elevated a minimum of one foot above the
Base Flood Elevation (BFE).

§ 17.8.340  BEFORE REGULATORY FLOODWAY.



   In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM,
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.

§ 17.8.345  FLOODWAYS.



   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
17.8.315B. are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:



   A.   Except as provided in paragraph C. below, prohibit
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
and other development unless certification by a registered professional civil
engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.



   B.   If § 17.8.345A. is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 17.8.335, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.



   C.   Temporary structures placed in the floodway: Relief from
no-rise evaluation, elevation or dry flood-proofing standards may be granted
for a non-residential structure placed during the dry season (June –
October) and for a period of less than 90 days. A plan for the removal of the
temporary structure after the dry season or when a flood event threatens
shall be provided. The plan shall include disconnecting and protecting from
water infiltration and damage all utilities servicing the temporary structure.



   D.   Temporary storage of goods and materials, not including
hazardous materials, is allowed in the floodway for a period of less than 90
days within the dry season (June – October).

§ 17.8.350  CRITICAL FACILITY.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
(100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be
permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available.
Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor
elevated three feet above BFE or to the height of the 500-year flood,
whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be
protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures
must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or
released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of
the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
extent possible.

§ 17.8.355  ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE.



   All property owners, developers or other persons proposing to modify
land in the city limits of Forest Grove are encouraged to integrate the
habitat-friendly development practices listed in Table 8-1 as part of any
modification of the site. Those practices within road rights-of-way or other
public property shall be approved by the City Engineer. Other practices shall
be approved by the Community Development Department. Said approvals shall be
obtained:



   A.   Where no land use permit is required, prior to any physical
modification of the site;



   B.   Where any land use permit is required by the Development Code,
concurrent with an approval of the permit; or



   C.   Where there is a Natural Resource Area and alternative
discretionary development standards are used pursuant to the requirements of
§ 17.5.040.



 

Table 8-1:  Habitat-Friendly Development Practices*


   Part (a):  Design and Construction Practices to Minimize Hydrologic
Impacts




1.   Amend disturbed soils to original or higher level of porosity to
regain infiltration and stormwater storage capacity.


2.   Use pervious paving materials for residential driveways , parking
lots, walkways and within centers of cul-de-sacs .


3.   Incorporate stormwater management in road rights-of-way.


4.   Landscape with rain gardens to provide on-lot detention, filtering of
rainwater and groundwater recharge.


5.   Use green roofs for runoff reduction, energy savings, improved air
quality and enhanced aesthetics.


6.   Disconnect downspouts from roofs and direct the flow to vegetated
infiltration/filtration areas such as rain gardens.


7.   Retain rooftop runoff in a rain barrel for later on-lot use in lawn
and garden watering.


8.   Use multi-functional open drainage systems in lieu of more
conventional curb-and-gutter systems.


9.   Use bioretention cells as rain gardens in landscaped parking lot
islands to reduce runoff volume and filter pollutants.


10.   Apply a treatment train approach to provide multiple opportunities
for stormwater treatment and reduce the possibility of system failure.   


11.   Reduce sidewalk width and grade them such that they drain to the
front yard of a residential lot or retention area.


12.   Reduce impervious impacts of residential driveways by narrowing
widths and moving access to the rear of the site .


13.   Use shared driveways .


14.   Reduce width of residential streets , depending on traffic and
parking needs.


15.   Reduce street length, primarily in residential areas, by encouraging
clustering and using curvilinear designs.


16.   Reduce cul-de-sac radii and use pervious vegetated islands in center
to minimize impervious effects, and allow them to be utilized for truck
maneuvering/loading to reduce need for wide loading areas on site .


17.   Eliminate redundant non-ADA sidewalks within a site (i.e., sidewalk
to all entryways and/or to truck loading areas may be unnecessary for
industrial developments ).


18.   Minimize car spaces and stall dimensions, reduce parking ratios and
use shared parking facilities and structured parking.


19.   Minimize the number of stream crossings and place crossing
perpendicular to stream channel if possible.


20.   Allow narrow street right-of-ways through stream corridors whenever
possible to reduce adverse impacts of transportation corridors.


*These development practices represent the state of scientific knowledge at
the time of this Code’s enactment, if more effective habitat-friendly
practices become available, they should be used.


Part (b):  Design and Construction Practices to Minimize Impacts on Wildlife
Corridors and Fish Passage


1.   Carefully integrate fencing into the landscape to guide animals
toward animal crossings under, over or around transportation corridors.


2.   Use bridge crossings rather than culverts wherever possible.


3.   If culverts are utilized, install slab, arch or box type culverts,
preferably using bottomless designs that more closely mimic stream bottom
habitat.


4.   Design stream crossings for fish passage with shelves and other
design features to facilitate terrestrial wildlife passage.


5.   Extend vegetative cover through the wildlife crossing in the
migratory route, along with sheltering areas.


Part (c):  Miscellaneous Other Habitat-Friendly Design and Construction
Practices


1.   Use native plants throughout the development (not just in NRA).


2.   Locate landscaping (required by other sections of the Code) adjacent
to NRA.


3.   Reduce light-spill off into NRAs from development .

requirements.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.410  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   A.   Obligation to maintain. It shall be the continuing obligation
of the property owner to maintain required landscaped areas in an attractive
manner free of weeds and noxious vegetation .  In addition, the minimum
amount of required living landscape materials shall be maintained.



   B.   Ground preparation. The ground in all required landscaped areas
should be properly prepared with suitable soil and fertilizer. Specifications
shall be submitted with the landscape plans showing that adequate preparation
of the top soil and sub-soil will be undertaken prior to planting to support
the plantings over a long period of time.



   C.   Installation requirements. The installation of all landscaping
shall be as follows:



      1.   All landscaping shall be installed according to accepted
planting procedures and the provisions of this article;



      2.   The plant materials shall be of high grade, and shall
meet the size and grading standards of the American Standards for Nursery
Stock; and



      3.   All required landscaped areas must be provided with a
piped underground irrigation system unless a licensed landscape architect or
certified nurseryman submits written verification that the proposed plant
materials do not require irrigation.



   D.   Pruning required. All plant growth in landscaped areas of
developments shall be controlled by pruning or trimming so that it will not:



      1.   Interfere with the maintenance or repair of any public
utility;



      2.   Restrict pedestrian or vehicular access; and



      3.   Constitute a traffic hazard because of reduced visibility.



   E.   Certificate of occupancy. Certificates of occupancy shall not
be issued unless the landscaping requirements have been met or other
arrangements have been made and approved by the city such as the posting of a
performance bond or security equal to 125% of the cost of the landscaping.



   F.   Care of landscaping along public rights-of-way. Appropriate
methods for the care and maintenance of street trees and landscaping
materials shall be provided by the owner of the property abutting the
rights-of-way unless otherwise required for emergency conditions and the
safety of the general public.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.415  GENERAL STANDARDS.



   A.   Non-invasive native vegetation is encouraged to be used for all
landscaping except within 100 feet of a natural resource area. In such
situations, native vegetation is required.



   B.   Installation of bio-swales or preservation of wetlands should
be located where possible in landscaped areas.



   C.   Required landscaping adjacent to public rights-of-way. A strip
of land at least five feet in width located between the abutting right-of-way
and the off-street parking area or vehicle use area which is exposed to an
abutting right-of-way, except in required vision clearance areas.



   D.   Perimeter landscaping relating to abutting properties. On the
site of a building or structure or open lot use providing an off-street
parking area or other vehicular use area, where such areas will not be
entirely screened visually by an intervening building or structure from
abutting property, a five-foot landscaped strip shall be between the common
lot line and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area exposed
to abutting property. Landscaped areas should include where possible water
quality features such as bio-swales or wetlands, trees, grass, shrubs and
other plant material so as to cover the landscape area.



   E.   Parking area interior landscaping. Landscaped areas shall be
appropriately distributed to break up large expanses of pavement, improve the
appearance and climate of the site, improve safety and delineate pedestrian
walkways and traffic lanes. Except for industrial development within
industrial zones, the following interior landscaping shall be met.



      1.   Percentage approach. For the purpose of this section,
INTERIOR PARKING LOT AREA is defined as the hard surface parking area
(parking stalls and aisles ). Such area does not include loading and
unloading zones or perimeter landscaping around the lot . Where perimeter
landscaping intrudes into the parking lot four or more feet, that area is
included in both the interior parking lot area and interior parking lot
landscaping.



Figure 8-7: Parking Lot Landscaping







 



      2.   A required landscaped area shall have a minimum interior
dimension of six feet and be no less than 48 square feet in area.



      3.   At least 8% of the Interior Parking Lot Area shall be
landscaped. Landscaped areas may include water quality features such as
bio-swales or wetlands, trees, grass, shrubs and other plant material so as
to cover the landscape area.



      4.   One tree shall be required for every 1,600 square feet of
interior parking lot area as defined in subsection 1. above. Trees shall have
a minimum two-inch caliper and six-foot branch height at time of planting.



      5.   Interior parking area landscaping and trees must be
dispersed throughout the parking area. Some trees may be grouped, but the
groups must be dispersed. Required trees may be planted within five feet of
the edges of the parking area.



      6.   Perimeter landscaping area may not substitute for
interior landscaping. However, interior landscaping may join perimeter
landscaping as long as it extends four feet or more into the parking area
from the perimeter landscape line.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.420  LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS BY ZONE.



   A.   Landscaping required in the Neighborhood Commercial Zone. All
required yards (exclusive of accessways and other permitted intrusions)
adjacent to a public or private street shall be landscaped.



   B.   Landscaping required in the Community Commercial Zones. A
landscaped strip at least ten feet in width shall be provided abutting any
property line facing a street . The landscape strip shall be appropriately
landscaped with ground cover, planted berm , shrubbery and/or trees .



   C.   Landscaping required in the Town Center Zones. All new
commercial and residential developments in the Town Center Transition Zone
shall landscape no less than 5% of the lot area using appropriate native
plant materials and/or architectural features such as benches, planters and
water fountains which are suitable and supportive of the downtown commercial
environment.  Jointly improved landscaped areas are encouraged to facilitate
continuity of landscape design within the Town Center. The city may choose to
waive this requirement for developments that provide streetscape amenities
within the public right-of-way. New development in the Town Center Core zone
is exempt from the minimum landscaping requirement.



   D.   Landscaping required in the Institutional Zone. Landscaping
shall be in context with the use and surrounding zones. For institutional
uses that consist of primarily open space , such as a park or playground, the
landscaped area shall be defined by the site plan and include a landscaped
strip at least ten feet in width abutting any property line facing a street .
For institutional uses in which the site is primarily devoted to non-open
space , the landscaping requirements shall match the zone district
immediately adjacent to the use . Where there are no landscaping requirements
for the adjoining zone, the landscaping requirements shall meet the
requirements of subsection B., Community Commercial above.



   E.   Seventy-five percent coverage. Except in the Town Center Core
Zone, at least 75% of the required landscaped area shall be planted with any
suitable combination of trees specified time as follows:



      1.   Trees – within five years from the date of final
inspection by the Building Official;



      2.   Shrubs – within two years from the date of final
inspection by the building Official; and



      3.   Ground covers – at the time of final inspection by the
Building Official.



      F.   Twenty-five percent architectural features. Except in the
Town Center Core Zone, landscaped areas as required by this article may
include architectural features or artificial ground covers such as
sculptures, benches, masonry or stone walls, fences , rock groupings,
decorative hard paving and gravel areas, interspersed with planting areas.
The exposed area developed with such features shall not exceed 25% of the
required landscaped area. Artificial plants are prohibited in any required
landscaped area.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.425  BUFFERING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.



   A.   General provisions.



      1.   It is the intent that these requirements shall provide
for privacy and protection and reduce or eliminate the adverse impacts of
visual or noise pollution at a development site, without unduly interfering
with the view from neighboring properties or jeopardizing the safety of
pedestrians and vehicles;



      2.   Buffering and screening is required to reduce the impacts
on adjacent uses which are of a different type in accordance with the
matrices in this chapter (Tables 8-2, 8-3 and 8-4). The owner of each
proposed development is responsible for the installation and effective
maintenance of buffering and screening.



      3.   In lieu of these standards, a detailed buffer area
landscaping and screening plan may be submitted for the Director’s approval
as an alternative to the standards, provided it affords the same degree of
buffering and screening as required by this Code.



   B.   Buffering and screening requirements.



      1.   A buffer consists of an area within a required setback
adjacent to a property line and having a depth equal to the amount specified
in the buffering and screening matrix and containing a length equal to the
length of the property line of the abutting use or uses.



      2.   Utilities, screening, sidewalks and bikeways, and
landscaping may only occupy a buffer area. No buildings, accessways or
parking areas shall be allowed in a buffer area except where an accessway has
been approved by the city.



      3.   The minimum improvements within a buffer area shall
consist of combinations for landscaping and screening as specified in Tables
8-2, 8-3 and 8-4.  In addition, improvements shall meet the following
specifications:



         a.   At least one row of trees shall be planted. They
shall have a minimum caliper of two inches at four feet in height above grade
for deciduous trees and a minimum height of five feet high for evergreen
trees at the time of planting. Spacing for trees shall be as follows:



            1.   Small or narrow-stature trees, less than 25
feet tall or less than 16 feet wide at maturity shall be spaced no further
than 20 feet apart;



            2.   Medium-sized trees between 25 to 40 feet tall
and with 16 to 35 feet wide branching at maturity shall be spaced no greater
than 30 feet apart; and



            3.   Large trees, over 40 feet tall and with more
than 35 feet wide branching at maturity, shall be spaced no greater than 40
feet apart.



         b.   In addition, at least ten five-gallon shrubs or 20
one-gallon shrubs shall be planted for each 1,000 square feet of required
buffer area; and



         c.   The remaining area shall be planted in lawn or
other living ground cover.



      4.   Where screening is required the following standards shall
apply in addition to those required for buffering:



         a.   A hedge of narrow or broad leaf evergreen shrubs
shall be planted which will form a four-foot continuous screen of the height
specified in Table 8-3 within two years of planting;



         b.   An earthen berm planted with evergreen plant
materials shall be provided which will form a continuous screen of the height
specified in Table 8-3 within two years; or



         c.   A fence or wall of the height specified in Table
8-3 shall be constructed to provide a continuous sight-obscuring screen.



      5.   Buffering and screening provisions shall be superseded by
the clear vision area requirements as set forth in § 17.8.150.



      6.   When the use to be screened is downhill from the
adjoining zone or use, the prescribed heights of required fences, walls or
landscape screening shall be measured from the actual grade of the adjoining
property. In this case, fences and walls may exceed the permitted six-foot
height at the discretion of the Director as a condition of approval. When the
grades are so steep so as to make the installation of walls, fences or
landscaping to the required height impractical, a detailed
landscape/screening plan shall be submitted for approval.



      7.   Fences and walls.



         a.   Fences and walls shall be constructed of any
materials commonly used in the construction of fences and walls such as wood,
stone, rock or brick, or otherwise acceptable by the Director;



         b.   Such fence or wall construction shall be in
compliance with other city regulations;



         c.   Walls shall be a minimum of six inches thick; and



         d.   Chain link fences with slats shall qualify for
screening. However, chain link fences without slats shall require the
planting of a continuous evergreen hedge to be considered screening.



   C.   Screening: special provisions.



      1.   Screening and landscaping of parking and loading areas.
Screening and landscaping of parking and loading areas is required as
provided in this article.



      2.   Screening of service facilities. Except for one-family
and two-family dwellings , any service facilities such as gas meters and air
conditioners which would otherwise be visible from a public street , customer
or resident parking area, any public facility or any residential area shall
be screened from view by placement of a solid wood fence or masonry wall
between five and eight feet in height.



      3.   Screening of refuse containers. Except for one- and
two-family dwellings , any refuse container or refuse collection area which
would be visible from a public street , parking lot, residential or
commercial area, or any public facility such as a school or park shall be
screened or enclosed from view by placement of a solid wood fence , masonry
wall or evergreen hedge. All refuse shall be contained within the screened
area.



      4.   Screening of swimming pools. All swimming pools shall be
enclosed as required by the City of Forest Grove Building Code .



   D.   Buffer Matrix.



      1.   The Buffer Matrices contained in Table 8-2 shall be used
in calculating widths of buffering/screening and required improvements to be
installed between proposed uses and abutting uses or zoning districts.



      2.   An application for an adjustment or variance to the
standards required in Tables 8-2 and 8-3 shall be processed as a Type I, II
or III procedure, as regulated by Article 2 provisions for Adjustments and
Variances.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING



§ 17.8.500  PURPOSE.



   A.   Ensure adequate vehicle parking. These parking requirements are
intended to provide sufficient vehicle parking in close proximity to the
various uses for residents, customers and employees , and to establish
standards that will maintain the traffic carrying capacity of nearby streets .



   B.   Adequate capacity. These regulations are also intended to
establish vehicle parking areas which have adequate capacity and which are
appropriately located and designed to minimize any hazardous conditions on
the site and at access points.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.505  APPLICABILITY.



   A.   New construction. At the time of the erection of a new
structure within any residential, commercial, institutional and industrial
zoning district , off-street vehicle parking shall be provided in accordance
with this section. Except as specified in subsection D. below, uses in the
Town Center zones are exempt from the requirement to provide off-street
parking.



   B.   Expansion of existing use. At the time of an enlargement of a
structure , which increases the on-site vehicle parking requirement,
off-street vehicle parking shall be provided in accordance with this section,
subject to the following:



      1.   On the date of adoption of this Code, the number of
vehicle parking and loading spaces required shall be based only on floor area
or capacity of such enlargement.



   C.   Change of use. When an existing structure is changed from one
use to another as listed in this section, the following provisions shall
apply.



      1.   If the parking requirements for each use are the same, no
additional vehicle parking shall be required.



      2.   Where a change results in an intensification of use in
terms of the number of vehicle parking spaces required, additional vehicle
parking spaces shall be provided in an amount equal to the difference between
the number of spaces required for the existing use and the number of spaces
required for the more intensive use.



      3.   Where the change results in a decrease in intensity of
use, the applicant may eliminate excess vehicle parking spaces in an amount
equal to the difference between the number of spaces required for the
existing use and the number of spaces required for the less intensive use.



   D.   Parking exemption for the town center zones. Except for new
multi-family dwelling units, all development in the Town Center zones shall
be exempt from off-street parking requirements for new construction ,
expansion of existing use and change of use . New multi-family or mixed-use
developments (residential portion only) shall provide the minimum required
spaces in accordance with Table 8-4 except that:



      1.   In order to encourage the preservation and reuse of

plan submitted under the provisions of this article by means of a Type I
review.



   B.   Parking plan requirements. The parking plan, drawn to scale,
shall show all elements necessary to indicate that off-street parking
requirements are met. The parking plan shall include but not be limited to:



      1.   Delineation of individual parking and loading spaces and
their dimensions;



      2.   Circulation area necessary to serve parking spaces;



      3.   Access to streets, alleys and properties to be served;

dwellings and duplexes); and



      7.   Specifications as to signs and bumper guards (does not
apply to single-family dwellings and duplexes).



   C.   Building permit conditions. The provisions and maintenance of
off-street vehicle parking and loading spaces are the continuing obligation
of the property owner:



      1.   No building or other permit shall be issued until plans
are presented to the Director to show that property is and will remain

when the peak hours of operation do not overlap, provided that satisfactory
legal evidence is presented to the Director in the form of deeds , leases
and/or contracts to establish the joint use .



   E.   Parking area connections. In order to eliminate the need to use
public streets for movements between commercial or industrial properties,
parking areas shall be designed to connect with parking areas within a
project site and on adjacent properties unless not feasible. Access easements
between properties shall be required where necessary to provide for parking
area connections.

Code, “one standard parking space ” means a parking stall of nine feet in
width and 18 feet in length. To accommodate compact cars more efficiently, up
to 50% of the available parking spaces may have a minimum dimension of eight
feet in width and 16 feet in length so long as they are identified as compact
car stalls and are not readily accessible to large cars.

§ 17.8.515  OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Multiple uses. In the event several uses occupy a single
building or parcel of land, a reduction of 25% of the total required parking
is allowed for projects that utilize shared parking on a blended ratio for
complementary uses.



   B.   Location of off-street parking. Off-street parking spaces for
dwellings shall be located on the same lot with the dwelling . For all other
uses, required off-street parking spaces shall be located not farther than
500 feet from the building or use they are required to serve, except as
exempted in the Town Center zones.



   C.   Improvements. Required parking spaces shall be improved to the
standards as contained in this article and available for use at the time of
the final building inspection.



   D.   Carpool and vanpool parking. Commercial, industrial and
institutional developments (including but not limited to hospitals, nursing
and retirement homes, schools , churches, auditoriums and transit
park-and-ride facilities) with 20 or more long-term parking spaces shall
designate at least 10% of those spaces for carpool and vanpool parking. These
spaces shall be located closer to the primary public or employee entrance
than all other parking spaces with the exception of handicapped parking
spaces .  Carpool and vanpool parking spaces shall be full-sized and clearly
designated for use by carpools or vanpools .



   E.   Minimum/maximum parking. Unless specified below or otherwise
exempted by this Code, the minimum and maximum number of required parking
spaces shall be provided for all uses in accordance with the specifications
of Table 8-4.



   F.   Exemptions from maximum parking standards. The following uses
shall be exempt from the maximum allowable parking standards of Table 8-4.
This exemption does not limit any provision or authority to restrict the
size, location or design of such uses. On sites where the following parking
is provided, it shall not be included in the parking count used for
determining the maximum allowable number of parking spaces :



      1.   Structured parking;



      2.   Valet lots;



      3.   Pay lots;

      6.   Automobile sales lots; and



      7.   Park-and-ride lots and area-wide public parking
facilities.



   G.   Unlisted use. Where a use is not specifically listed in Table
8-4, determination of the applicable parking standards shall be made in
accordance with the following procedure:



      1.   The Director shall determine the minimum and maximum
parking spaces for all uses not listed in Table 8-4, unless an application is
under review by the Planning Commission or Design Review Commission, in which
case the Commission shall make the determination.



      2.   In all determinations for unlisted uses, the applicant
shall be required to submit studies or technical information about the use,
parking demand, vehicle trip generation and/or other information as deemed
necessary to make a determination. The city may consider testimony and
publications of individuals, agencies or institutions experienced in parking
and traffic engineering in its determination of parking standards.



   H.   Determination of parking zone classification. Except as
provided for in this article or as modified under the variance process
outlined in § 17.2.700, parking provided shall not be less than the amount
specified in the “Minimum Parking Required” column nor greater than the
amount specified in the “Maximum Parking Allowed” column of Table 8-4
based on the appropriate Parking Zone Classification.



      1.   Parking Zone A. All properties located within one-quarter
mile walking distance of a transit bus stop that provide 20-minute peak hour
service shall be classified as Parking Zone A.



   In determining walking distance, the shortest distance measured along
sidewalks, improved pedestrian ways or streets, where sidewalks or improved
pedestrian ways are not present, shall be used. Walking distance shall be
measured from the nearest point of the subject lot located along the nearest
street frontage that allows for the shortest walking distance.



   The transit provider shall be the official source for transit stop
location and peak service availability.



      2.   Parking Zone B. All properties not located within Parking
Zone A shall be classified as Parking Zone B.

§ 17.8.520  REDUCTION OR MODIFICATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENT.



   A.   Parking reductions allowed by right. The following reductions
of minimum required parking may be taken by right. Reductions provided below
may not be taken jointly. The reductions allowed by this section may not be
used in conjunction with the reductions allowed by subsection B. below. In
determining walking distance, the shortest distance measured along sidewalks,
improved pedestrian ways or streets , where sidewalks or improved pedestrian
ways are not present, shall be used. Walking distance shall be measured from
the point on the subject lot located nearest to the transit stop along the
shortest course.



      1.   Parking for commercial and industrial uses may be reduced
by 10% providing the development is within 500 feet walking distance of a
transit stop.



      2.   Parking for multi-family uses may be reduced by 10%
providing the development is within 500 feet walking distance of a transit
stop.



      3.   Parking facilities may be reduced to the extent necessary
to accommodate transit stop and shelters.



   B.   Modification of minimum off-street parking requirements.
Minimum parking required may be decreased as follows:



      1.   For uses requiring a minimum of ten or more parking
spaces, inclusive of all uses in the case of mixed-use development, required
parking may be reduced by up to 15% of the minimum required for sites located
in Parking Zone A, upon demonstration that the modification is warranted and
meets the following criteria:



         a.   Will not result in undue site congestion;



         b.   Will not result in traffic hazards on the site or
adjoining streets; and



         c.   Will not result in an undue reduction in the
availability of on street parking or parking located in facilities owned
and/or operated by the city.



      2.   Subject to § 17.2.200, Conditional Uses, a reduction of
up to 25% of the total required parking may be granted for new development,
redevelopment and substantial improvements, subject to the other requirements
of this section, in such cases where:



         a.   The project is utilizing shared parking where the
amount of shared parking is based on a blended ratio and the land uses are
shown to be complimentary and will, by virtue of their proximity, reduce the
number of vehicle trips generated and the amount of parking needed.



         b.   For mixed use projects, the site is located within
Parking Zone A and no less than one-half of the total gross floor area is
dedicated to residential uses.



         c.   For the purposes of this section, “substantial
improvement” shall mean any construction, renovation, or modification where
the value of the proposed site and building improvements exceeds 30% of the
value of the land and buildings thereon.



   C.   Modification of maximum off-street parking requirements.
Maximum parking allowed may be increased as follows.



      1.   Maximum parking allowed may be increased up to 15% of the
applicable standard, subject to the requirements of this section and further
subject to compliance with all zoning standards and management of related
stormwater runoff.



      2.   Overflow parking areas using “grass-crete” or similar
reinforced, drained and seeded hard surface alternatives may be approved for
up to an additional 25% of parking spaces allowed in Table 8-4.



      3.   Mitigation of adverse impacts may be required as a
condition to make an increase of required parking acceptable.



   D.   Procedure for review. The Director may authorize modifications
pursuant to this section; unless the application is under review by the
Planning Commission or the Design Commission, in which case the Planning
Commission or the Design Commission shall consider the request for
modification.



      1.   Parking and traffic analyses needed to demonstrate the
feasibility of modifications requested pursuant to this section shall be
prepared by a qualified professional, using methods generally accepted in the
field.



      2.   The applicant shall follow procedures and criteria for
Adjustments or Variances as described in Article 2.

§ 17.8.525  DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AND
LOADING.



   A.   No backing movement. Excluding single-family and duplex
residences, groups of more than two parking spaces shall be served by a
service drive so that no backing movements or other maneuvering within a
street or other public right-of-way would be required.



   B.   Free flow of traffic. Service drives shall be designed and
constructed to facilitate the flow of traffic, provide maximum safety of
traffic access and egress , and maximum safety of pedestrians and vehicular
traffic on the site .



   C.   Parking accessible from street. Each parking and/or loading
space shall be accessible from a street and the access shall be of a width
and location as described in §§ 17.8.100 et seq. for Access and Circulation.



   D.   Parking space, stall and access aisle dimensions.Parking space
configuration, stall and access aisle size shall be of sufficient width for
all vehicles turning and maneuvering, based on the standards shown in Figures
8-10 and 8-11.



   E.   Permanent marking. Except for single-family and duplex
residences, any area intended to be used to meet the off-street parking
requirements shall have all parking spaces clearly marked using permanent
paint. All interior drives and access aisles shall be clearly marked and

§ 17.8.545  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING OF PARKING AND LOADING AREAS.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to improve the
appearance of off-street parking and open lot sales and service areas in
Forest Grove and to protect and preserve the appearance, character and value
of the surrounding neighborhoods. It is also the purpose of this section to
allow for increased seepage by providing openings in impervious surface ;
increased safety by breaking up large expanses of pavement; and increased
shading to reduce overheating of car interiors, and reduce glare and
radiation from large number of vehicles.



   B.   Applicability. This section is applicable to all areas used for
the display or parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy
construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are
self-propelled or not, and all land upon which vehicles traverse the property
as a function of the primary use , hereinafter referred to as “other
vehicular uses,” including but not limited to activities of a drive-in
nature such as, but not limited to, filling stations, grocery and dairy
stores, banks, restaurants and the like. Screening and landscaping of parking
and loading areas is required, with the exception of parking areas serving
single-family dwellings and duplexes , and parking areas that are under or
within buildings . The interior landscaping requirements do not apply to
parking areas for industrial uses in the industrial zones.



   C.   Required landscaping for parking lots adjacent to public
rights-of-way. A minimum five-foot landscaped strip is required between the
abutting right-of-way and the off-street parking area or vehicle use area.



   D.   Perimeter parking lot landscaping. When the off-street parking
area or other vehicular use area is not visually screened from an abutting
property by an intervening building or structure , a minimum five-foot
landscaped strip shall be installed between the common property line and the
off-street parking area or other vehicular use area that is visually exposed.



   E.   Interior parking lot landscaping. Landscaped areas shall be
appropriately distributed to break up large expanses of pavement, improve the
appearance and climate of the site , improve safety and delineate pedestrian
walkways and traffic lanes. For the purpose of this section, interior parking
lot area is defined as the hard surface parking area (parking stalls and
aisles ). Such area does not include loading and unloading zones or perimeter
landscaping around the lot .



      1.   At least 8% of the interior parking lot area shall be
landscaped. Landscaped areas should include water quality features such as
bio-swales or wetlands, trees, grass, shrubs and other material when possible
so as to cover the landscape area.



      2.   A required landscaped area shall have a minimum interior
dimension of six feet and be no less than 48 square feet in area. Landscaping
shall be protected from vehicular damage by some form of wheel guard or curb.



      3.   One tree shall be required for every 1,600 square feet of
interior parking lot area. Trees shall have a minimum two-inch caliper and
six-foot branch height at the time of planting.



      4.   Interior parking area landscaping and trees must be
dispersed throughout the parking area.  Some trees may be grouped, but the
groups must be dispersed.



      5.   Perimeter landscaping may not substitute for interior
landscaping. However, interior landscaping may join perimeter landscaping as
long as it extends four feet or more into the parking area from the perimeter
landscape line.



   F.   Landscaping within clear vision areas. All landscaping of
parking lots within clear vision areas shall provide unobstructed
cross-visibility at a level between three to ten feet above the curb line.
With the exception of grass or groundcover, no landscaping shall be located
closer than three feet from the edge of any accessway pavement.

PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS



§ 17.8.600  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for the
implementation of public and private facilities and utilities such as
streets, sewers and drainage.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.605  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   A.   When standards apply. Unless otherwise provided, the standard
specifications for construction, reconstruction or repair of streets ,
sidewalks, curbs and other public improvements within the city shall occur in
accordance with the standards of this article. No development may occur
unless the public facilities related to development comply with the public
facility requirements established in this section.



   B.   Standard specifications. The City Engineer shall establish
standard specifications consistent with the application of engineering
principles.



   C.   Adjustments. Adjustments to the provisions in this chapter
related to street improvements may be granted by means of a Type II
procedure, as governed by § 17.2.100.



   D.   Use of pervious surfaces. Where improvements subject to these
off-street parking and loading provisions result in hard surfaces, previous
surfaces should be used where possible. Where improvements are within the
public rights-of-way, such surfaces can be used upon approval by the City
Engineer .



   E.   Open drainage facilities. Where public storm sewer lines are
proposed, drainage swales and other open drainage facilities may be used with
the approval of the City Engineer .



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.610  STREETS.



   A.   Improvements. No development shall occur unless the development
has frontage or approved access to a public street :



      1.   Streets within a development and streets adjacent shall
be improved in accordance with this article;



      2.   Any new street or additional street width planned as a
portion of an existing street shall be dedicated and improved in accordance
with this Code;



      3.   New development shall be connected to a collector or
arterial by a paved street;



      4.   Where transportation-related improvements are required as
a result of a transportation study pursuant to § 17.1.225D., the developer
shall install said improvements to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, or
participate in the financing of said improvement where the impacts are beyond
the responsibility of one project; and



      5.   The City Engineer may accept a future improvement
guarantee in lieu of street or other transportation related improvements if
one or more of the following conditions exist:



         a.   A partial improvement is not feasible due to the
inability to achieve proper design standards;



         b.   A partial improvement may create a potential safety
hazard to motorists or pedestrians;



         c.   Due to the nature of existing development on
adjacent properties it is unlikely that street improvements would be extended
in the foreseeable future and the improvement associated with the project
under review does not, by itself, provide a significant improvement to street
safety or capacity;



         d.   The improvement would be in conflict with an
adopted capital improvement plan;



         e.   The improvement is associated with an approved land
partition on property zoned residential and the proposed land partition does
not create any new streets; or



         f.   Additional planning work is required to define the
appropriate design standards for the street and the application is for a
project that would contribute only a minor portion of the anticipated future
traffic on the street.



      6.   Improvements to streets shall be made according to
adopted city standards, unless the approval authority determines that the
standards will result in an unacceptable adverse impact on existing
development or on the proposed development or on natural features such as
wetlands, steep slopes or existing mature trees.



   B.   Creation of rights-of-way for streets and related purposes.
Rights-of-way shall be created through the approval of a final subdivision
plat or major partition ; however, the Council may approve the creation of a
street by acceptance of a deed , provided that such street is deemed
essential by the Council for the purpose of general traffic circulation:



      1.   The Council may approve the creation of a street by deed
of dedication without full compliance with the regulations applicable to
subdivisions or major partitions if any one or more of the following
conditions are found by the Council to be present:



         a.   Establishment of a street is initiated by the
Council and is found to be essential for the purpose of general traffic
circulation, and partitioning or subdivision of land has an incidental effect
rather than being the primary objective in establishing the road or v for
public use; or



         b.   The tract in which the road or street is to be
dedicated is an isolated ownership of one acre or less and such dedication is
recommended by the Commission to the Council based on a finding that the
proposal is not an attempt to evade the provisions of this title governing
the control of subdivisions or major partitions.



      2.   With each application for approval of a road or street
right-of-way not in full compliance with the regulations applicable to the
standards, the proposed dedication shall be made a condition of subdivision
and major partition approval:



         a.   The applicant shall submit such additional
information and justification as may be necessary to enable the Commission in
its review to determine whether or not a recommendation for approval by the
Council shall be made;



         b.   The recommendation, if any, shall be based upon a
finding that the proposal is not in conflict with the purpose of this title;



         c.   The Commission in submitting the proposal with a
recommendation to the Council may attach conditions which are necessary to
preserve the standards of this title; and d. All deeds of dedication shall be
in a form prescribed by the city and shall name “the public” as grantee.



   C.   Creation of access easements. The approval authority may
approve an access easement established by deed without full compliance with
this title provided such an easement is the only reasonable method by which a
lot large enough to develop can be created:



      1.   Access easements shall be provided and maintained in
accordance with the Uniform Fire Code;



      2.   Access shall be in accordance with §§ 17.8.100 et seq.



   D.   Street location, width and grade. Except as noted below, the
location, width and grade of all streets shall conform to an approved street
plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets , to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in
their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by
such streets :



      1.   Street grades shall be approved by the City Engineer in
accordance with subsection M. below; and



      2.   Where the location of a street is not shown in an
approved street plan, the arrangement of streets in a development shall
either:



         a.   Provide for the continuation or appropriate
projection of existing streets in the surrounding areas; or



         b.   Conform to a plan adopted by the Commission, if it
is impractical to conform to existing street patterns because of particular
topographical or other existing conditions of the land. Such a plan shall be
based on the type of land use to be served, the volume of traffic, the
capacity of adjoining streets and the need for public convenience and safety.



      3.   The City Engineer may require slope easements due to
topography, the size and shape of the tract, or other conditions.



   E.   Minimum rights-of-way and street widths. Unless otherwise
indicated on an approved street plan, or as needed to continue an existing
improved street , street right-of-way and roadway widths shall not be less
than the minimum width described below. Where a range is indicated, the width
shall be determined by the appropriate decision-making authority based upon
anticipated average daily traffic (ADT) on the new street segment. These are
presented in Table 8-7.



      1.   The decision-making body shall make its decision about
desired right-of-way width and pavement width of the various street types
within the subdivision or development after consideration of the following:



         a.   The type, design and location of the road as set
forth in the Transportation System Plan. Standards for specific streets
identified in the Transportation System Plan shall apply;



         b.   Anticipated traffic generation;



         c.   On-street parking needs;



         d.   Sidewalk and bikeway requirements;



         e.   Requirements for placement of utilities;



         f.   Street lighting;



         g.   Drainage and slope impacts;



         h.   Street tree location;



         i.   Planting and landscape areas;



         j.   Safety and comfort for motorists, bicyclists and
pedestrians; and



         k.   Access needs for emergency vehicles.

[8] Half-street improvements apply where a new development requires the
installation of a new street or extension of an existing street on the
boundary of the development project in order to provide access to that
development . The standard identified in the table is based on two 12-foot
travel lanes and no parking shall be allowed on either side of the street .
The developer may have the option to widen the street to 16-foot lane widths
in one or both directions. Where a lane width is 16 feet, on-street parking
is allowed for that lane. Such widening does not change sidewalk and parkway
requirements.




 



   F.   Future street plan and extension of streets.



      1.   A future street plan shall: 



         a.   Be filed by the applicant in conjunction with an
application for a subdivision or partition. The plan shall show the pattern
of existing and proposed future streets from the boundaries of the proposed
land division and shall include other parcels within 500 feet surrounding and
adjacent to the proposed land division. At the applicant’s request, the
city shall prepare a future streets proposal. A street proposal may be
modified when subsequent subdivision proposals are submitted; and



         b.   Identify existing or proposed bus routes, pullouts
or other transit facilities, bicycle routes and pedestrian facilities on or
within 530 feet of the site.



      2.   For new residential and mixed-use developmentt, possible
local street connections to contiguous vacant or primary undeveloped land
must be identified in conformance with street projections outlined on the
Local Street Connectivity Plan, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan Map.



      3.   Where necessary to give access or permit a satisfactory
future division of adjoining land, streets shall be extended to the boundary
lines of the tract to be developed; and



         a.   These extended streets or street stubs to adjoining
properties are not considered to be cul-de-sacs since they are intended to
continue as through streets at such time as the adjoining property is
developed.



         b.   A barricade shall be constructed at the end of the
street by the property owners which shall not be removed until authorized by
the City Engineer, the cost of which shall be included in the street
construction cost.



         c.   Temporary hammerhead turnouts or temporary
cul-de-sac bulbs shall be constructed for stub streets in excess of 150 feet
in length.



   G.   Street alignment and connections.



      1.   Staggering of streets making “T” intersections at
collectors and arterials shall not be designed so that jogs of less than 300
feet on such streets are created, as measured from the centerline of such
street.



      2.   Spacing between local street intersections shall have a
minimum separation of 125 feet.



      3.   All local and minor collector streets that abut a
development site shall be extended within the site to provide through
circulation when not precluded by environmental or topographical constraints,
existing development patterns or strict adherence to other standards in this
Code. A street connection or extension is considered precluded when it is not
possible to redesign or reconfigure the street pattern to provide required
extensions. Land is considered topographically constrained if the slope is
greater than 15% for a distance of 250 feet or more. In the case of
environmental or topographical constraints, the mere presence of a constraint
is not sufficient to show that a street connection is not possible. The
applicant must show why the constraint precludes some reasonable street
connection.



      4.   Proposed street or street extensions shall be located to
provide direct access to existing or planned transit stops, commercial
services and other neighborhood facilities, such as schools, shopping areas
and parks.



      5.   All developments should provide an internal network of
connecting streets that provide short, direct travel routes and minimize
travel distances within the development.



   H.   Intersection angles.Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect at an angle as near to a right angle as practicable, except where
topography requires a lesser angle, but in no case shall the angle be less
than 75o unless there is special intersection design, and:



      1.   Streets shall have at least 25 feet of tangent adjacent
to the right-of-way intersection unless topography requires a lesser distance;



      2.   Intersections which are not at right angles shall have a
minimum corner radius of 20 feet along the right-of-way lines of the acute
angle; and



      3.   Right-of-way lines at intersection with arterial streets
shall have a corner radius of not less than 20 feet.



   I.   Existing rights-of-way. Whenever existing rights-of-way
adjacent to or within a tract are of less than standard width, additional
rights-of-way shall be provided at the time of subdivision or development .



   J.   Partial street improvements. Partial street improvements
resulting in a pavement width of less than 20 feet; while generally not
acceptable may be approved where essential to reasonable development when in
conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and when it will
be practical to require the improvement of the other half when the adjoining
property developed.



   K.   Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac shall be no more than 200 feet long,
shall not provide access to greater than 20 dwelling units, and shall only be
used when environmental or topographical constraints, existing development
pattern, or strict adherence to other standards in this Code preclude street
extension and through circulation.



      1.   All cul-de-sacs shall terminate with a turnaround. Use of
turnaround configurations other than circular shall be approved by the City
Engineer.



      2.   The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured along the
centerline of the roadway from the near side of the intersecting street to
the farthest point of the cul-de-sac.



      3.   If a cul-de-sac is more than 300 feet long, a lighted
direct pathway to an adjacent street may be required to be provided and
dedicated to the city.



   L.   Street names. No street name shall be used which will duplicate
or be confused with the names of existing streets in Washington County,
except for extensions of existing streets . Street names and numbers shall
conform to the established pattern in the surrounding area.



   M.   Grades and curves. Grades shall not exceed 10% on arterials,
12% on collector streets , or 12% on any other street (except that local or
residential access streets may have segments with grades of up to 15% for
distances of no greater than 250 feet), and:



      1.   Centerline radii of curves shall not be less than 700
feet on arterials, 500 feet on major collectors, 350 feet on minor
collectors, or 100 feet on other streets; and



      2.   Streets intersecting with a minor collector or greater
functional classification street, or streets intended to be posted with a
stop sign or signalization shall provide a landing averaging 5% or less.
Landings are that portion of the street within 20 feet of the edge of the
intersecting street at full improvement.



   N.   Curbs, curb cuts, ramps and driveway approaches. Concrete
curbs, curb cuts, wheelchair, bicycle ramps and driveway approaches shall be
constructed in accordance with standards specified in this chapter; and:



      1.   Concrete curbs and driveway approaches are required;
except

constructed with City Engineer approval; and



      3.   Asphalt and concrete driveway approaches to the property
line shall be built to city configuration standards.



   O.   Streets adjacent to railroad right-of-way. Wherever the
proposed development contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way,
provision shall be made for a street approximately parallel to and on each
side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of
the land. The distance shall be determined with due consideration at cross
streets or the minimum distance required for approach grades and to provide
sufficient depth to allow screen planting along the railroad right-of-way in
nonindustrial areas.



   P.   Access control.Access control as described for each
classification of street   within the transportation element (Transportation
System Plan (TSP), shall be implemented when a new street   or street  
extension is built.



   Q.   Access to arterials and major collectors. Where a development
abuts or is traversed by an existing or proposed arterial or major collector
street , the development design shall provide adequate protection for
residential properties and shall separate residential access and through
traffic, or if separation is not feasible, the design shall minimize the
traffic conflicts. The design shall include any of the following:



      1.   A parallel access street along the arterial or major
collector;



      2.   Lots of suitable depth abutting the arterial or major
collector to provide adequate buffering with frontage along another street;



      3.   Screen planting at the rear or side property line to be
contained in a non-access reservation along the arterial or major collector;
or



      4.   Other treatment suitable to meet the objectives of this
subsection;



      5.   If a lot has access to two streets with different

commercial and industrial districts, alleys shall be provided unless other
permanent provisions for access to off-street parking and loading facilities
are made.



      2.   While alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment
shall be avoided, the corners of necessary alley intersections shall have a
radius of not less than 12 feet.



   S.   Survey monuments. Upon completion of a street improvement and
prior to acceptance by the city , it shall be the responsibility of the
developer’s registered professional land surveyor to provide certification
to the city that all boundary and interior monuments shall be reestablished
and protected.



   T.   Private streets.



      1.   Design standards for private streets shall be established
by the City Engineer; and



      2.   The city shall require legal assurances for the continued
maintenance of private streets, such as a recorded maintenance agreement.



      3.   Private streets serving more than six dwelling units are
permitted only within planned developments, mobile home parks and
multi-family residential developments.



   U.   Railroad crossings. Where an adjacent development results in a
need to install or improve a railroad crossing, the cost for such
improvements may be a condition of development approval, or another equitable
means of cost distribution shall be determined by the Public Works Director
and approved by the Commission.



   V.   Street signs. The city shall install all street signs ,
relative to traffic control and street names, as specified by the City
Engineer for any development . The cost of signs shall be the responsibility
of the developer.

OTHER DEVELOPMENT REVIEW STANDARDS



§ 17.8.880  SINGLE-FAMILY AND DUPLEX.



   A.   Purpose.



      1.   The purpose of the design standards is to ensure that new
residential development has a positive influence on the livability and safety
of surrounding neighborhoods. The standards are narrowly focused on improving
the way that new residential buildings relate to the public right-of-way
(streets, sidewalks and parkways).



   B.   Applicability.



      1.   The standard relating to street connection is applicable
to construction of single-family dwellings, manufactured homes and duplexes
on lots 9,000 square feet or smaller with an average slope of 12% or less.
The intent of the standard is to ensure that dwellings on smaller lots are
oriented to and visible from the public street and to enhance the pedestrian
environment. The dwelling diversity standard is applicable to new
subdivisions. Compliance with the design standards is checked during building
plan review.



Figure 8-19: Visual Surveillance Standard







 



   C.   Standards.



      1.   Street connection and visual surveillance standard. The
front facade shall be designed to provide a line of sight starting at a point
five feet above the floor and two feet directly back from any Standard Front
Porch (see definitions) or front-facing window such that a person, if there
were no vegetation, would be able to see 100% of their front property line.
The intent is to create a physical connection between the dwelling unit and
the public sidewalk and/or street, and to allow the dwelling units occupants
to see the public sidewalk and/or street for visual surveillance and crime
prevention.



      2.   Lot diversity requirement. For subdivisions of six lots
or more, there shall be a variety of lot sizes, with at least a 50% increase
between the smallest and largest lots.



      3.   Dwelling diversity standard. Front elevations shall not
be replicated on adjacent lots nor on lots directly across the street, within
any 24-month period or replicated within a subdivision over a 12-month period
more than the larger number of a) five times or b) 10% of the total number of
subdivision lots. These provisions can be met by having the requirements
included in the Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions of the subdivision.
For this section the definition of replication includes mirrored images
(where the main features such as windows, door location, garage location,
roof peak, etc. are reversed), and minor trim, and paint changes.



      4.   Building facade and elevation standards.



         a.   No more than that six single-family attached units
shall be allowed in a series.



         b.   Duplex units with single-family districts shall be
designed and constructed to give the impression from the street of one
single-family unit or, one corner lots, or two different units facing
different directions.



         c.   No more than 35% of the front facade area of an
attached single-family or duplex unit shall be used for garage doors.



         d.   Front elevations shall provide design variation to
avoid repetition and create architectural interest.



         e.   No building elevation shall have a horizontal or
vertical blank wall section greater than 15 feet.



      5.   The Director may approve an increase of the allowable
percentage of duplex or single-family attached units within SR, R-10, R-7 or
R-5 District is the following criteria are adequately addressed:



         a.   The location and placement of the duplex and
townhouse units maintain the appearance and single-family character of the
subdivision, especially in regards to adjacent single-family development;



         b.   Proposed duplex designs convey the appearance of
single-family units. For larger subdivisions, a number of different duplex
designs would be required to justify the increase percentage; and



         c.   The units visibility to the street, for example by
having front porches or provide vehicular or parking access from a back alley.

§ 17.8.885  INSTITUTIONAL ZONE DESIGN STANDARDS.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of the institutional design standards is
to ensure that new development has a positive influence on the livability and
safety of the Forest Grove community. The standards are focused on improving
the way that new institutional buildings relate to the surrounding
neighborhood, help create a pleasant pedestrian environment and support
available public transit service.



   B.   Applicability.



      1.   Development in the INST zone is subject to Design Review
under a Type II process.



      2.   Design Review for projects within the INST zone may be
conducted as part of a Type III, Conditional Use permit process.



   C.   Design standards for multi-unit residential buildings in INST
Zone. Multi-unit residential buildings in the Institutional District shall
meet the standards of Multi-unit development found in this article.



   D.   Design standards for non-residential buildings in INST Zone.



      1.   Building location. The building location should imitate
the pattern set by surrounding residential development . For example, if
adjacent dwellings are set back 20 feet from the street , the INST building
(s) should maintain the same setback .



      2.   Building orientation and entrance. At least one main
entrance to the INST building (s) shall be oriented to the street and
sidewalk rather than toward the parking area. A direct sidewalk connection
shall extend from the public sidewalk to the main entrance.



      3.   Parking location. Off-street parking for the INST
building (s) should be located to the side or behind the building and shall
not be located between the building and the street (s). To minimize the
extent of paved areas, on street parking available along the frontage of the
INST lot may be counted toward off-street parking requirements.



      5.   Trash storage area. The INST building (s) shall provide
an adequate sized trash storage area to accommodate waste generated on-site .
The trash storage area shall be screened from public view from the sidewalk.



      6.   Pedestrian connections and travel shall be given clear
priority in INST district.  The on-site pedestrian circulation system shall
connect to public sidewalks adjacent to the site.



      7.   Primary entrances shall be architecturally emphasized and
visible from the street.  Building entrances shall incorporate arcades,
roofs, porches, alcoves, porticoes or awnings that protect pedestrians from
the rain and sun.

LAND DIVISION STANDARDS



§ 17.8.900  PURPOSE.



   This subarticle contains many of the standards for land division
intended to preserve, protect and promote the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare of the community. These standards are to be
used in conjunction with the land division procedural requirements provided
in Article 6.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009; Ord. 2013-3, passed 5-22-2013)



§ 17.8.905  STANDARDS.



   A.   Block design.



      1.   The length, width and shape of blocks shall be designed
with due regard to providing adequate building sites for the use
contemplated, consideration of needs for convenient access, circulation,
control and safety of street traffic and recognition of limitations and
opportunities of topography.



      2.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate depths, except where blocks are adjacent to an
arterial, a railroad or waterway, and shall meet the following standards:



   B.   Block length and perimeter.



      1.   The layout of streets shall not create excessive travel
lengths. Block lengths shall be a maximum of 500 feet and block perimeters
shall be a maximum of 1,200 to 1,600 feet. Block length is defined as the
distance along a street between the centerline of two intersecting through
streets. Block perimeter is defined as the sum of the block lengths of all
sides of a block.



      2.   In residential subdivisions and mixed-use developments,
no block shall be more than 330 feet in length. This length can be exceeded
up to a maximum length of 660 feet under subsection C., Block length
exceptions, below.



   C.   Block length exceptions. An exception to the block length
standard may be permitted during the land division review when one of more of
the following conditions exists:



      1.   Physical conditions that preclude development of a public
street. In certain situations where the physical features of the land create
severe constraints, or natural features should be preserved, exceptions may
be made.  Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, topography,
wetlands, mature trees, creeks, drainages and rock outcroppings;



      2.   Buildings or other existing development on adjacent lands
that preclude a street connection now or in the future, considering the
potential for redevelopment;



      3.   Barriers such as freeways or railroads preclude street
connections;



      4.   Average slope of the block exceeds 15%, the additional
block length is the minimum necessary to address characteristics of the site,
and the tangent of the roadway centerline does not vary more than 30 degrees
transverse to the slope contours; and



      5.   Where an existing public street or streets terminating at
the boundary of the development site have a block length exceeding 500 feet,
or are situated such that the extension of the street(s) into the development
site would create a block length exceeding 500 feet. In such cases, the block
length shall be as close to 500 feet as practical.



   D.   Pedestrian ways.



      1.   Off-street pedestrian ways shall be connected to the
street network and used to provide pedestrian and bicycle access in
situations where a street is not feasible. In cases where a street connection
is feasible, off-street pedestrian ways shall not be permitted in lieu of a
traditional street with sidewalks.



      2.   When block lengths exceed 500 feet, a pedestrian way of
not less than ten feet in width shall be dedicated to provide pedestrian
access thorough the block, or to provide access to schools, parks, designated
open areas or other public areas. Such pedestrian ways shall be improved with
hard surface material with an appropriate base to a minimum width of five
feet prior to issuance of any building permit for construction within the
subdivision.



      3.   Sidewalks and/or pedestrian ways shall be designed
according to city standards or specifications on file at the city.



      4.   Designated crosswalks across streets may also be required
by the Director near the center of blocks that are over 500 feet in length.



   E.   Easements.



      1.   Easements of ten feet in width shall be provided along
the front lines of all lots or parcels for public utilities and sidewalks.
Larger easements may be required where necessary. The city or other
appropriate public agency shall be empowered to enter upon such easement for
construction or maintenance of public utilities, and to remove, if necessary,
any fence, tree, shrubbery or other obstruction, which may have been located
within the easement.



      2.   Where a land division contains a watercourse or area
serving for the accumulation or retention of surface water, easements shall
be provided for such watercourses or retention area to ensure that no
building or structure shall be erected therein.



      3.   Where the alignment of a utility easement (other than
required perimeter easements) is such that it would also serve as suitable
easement for originating or continuing a pedestrian/bicycle path, the
Director may require that such easement be designated on the plat as serving
both functions. In such cases, the minimum easement width shall be ten feet
and the pedestrian/bicycle path shall be improved with a hard surface to a
minimum width of eight feet.



   F.   Lots, parcels and common areas. The size, dimensions and
orientation of lots and parcels shall be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision or partition , for the type of development and use contemplated,
and shall be consistent with all applicable standards of this Code and the
following.



      1.   Lot and parcel side lines. The side lines of parcels in
partitions shall run at right angles to the street upon which they face to
the maximum extent feasible, and on curved streets shall be radial to the
curve wherever possible. The side lines of lots in subdivisions need not run
at right angles to the abutting street , but may be laid out at any suitable
angle to satisfy the solar access standards of § 17.5.400, and to allow for
a suitable subdivision design for the type of development and use
contemplated.



      2.   Frontage. Each lot and parcel shall have a minimum
frontage on a public street of at least 20 feet with two exceptions :



         a.   A lot or parcel on the radius of a curved street or
on the circular end of a cul-de-sac shall have frontage of not less than 30
feet upon the abutting street right-of-way measured on the arc.



         b.   Where a flag lot is proposed and the access strip
is serving only one lot, the frontage shall be not less than 15 feet.



      3.   Through lots and parcels.Through lots and parcels are
prohibited, except where they are necessary to provide separation of
development from arterial streets or adjacent incompatible activities or
developments . In such cases, the Director may require that evergreen
screening, a masonry wall, a landscaped earth berm and/or a non-access
easement be provided along the line of lots or parcels abutting such an
arterial street or other incompatible uses.



      4.   Future subdivision or partition of lots or parcels. Where
a subdivision or partition will result in a lot or parcel of one-half acre or
larger in size which in the judgment of the Director is likely to be further
divided in the future, the Director may require that the location of lot and
parcel lines and other details allow for efficient future division without
violating the requirements of this Code and without interfering with the
orderly extension of adjacent and abutting streets . The Director may also
require that restrictions concerning locations of buildings within future
street locations and vehicular access to lots or parcels be made a matter or
record if deemed necessary for permitting the efficient subsequent division
of the land.



      5.   Subsequent flag lots. Land partitions are prohibited
within subdivisions for a period of five years after the date of final plat
approval, unless the land is shown as a future development area on the final
plat .



      6.   Lot access to resource areas. For subdivisions ,
significant natural resources such as streams, riparian areas and wetlands
shall be protected, integrated into the design of the subdivision , platted
as a common area, and made accessible to as many individual parcels as
possible.



   G.   Public use areas.



      1.   Dedication requirements.



         a.   Where a proposed park, playground or other public
use shown in a development plan adopted by the city is located in whole or in
part in a subdivision, the Commission may require the dedication or
reservation of such area within the subdivision.



         b.   Where considered desirable by the Commission in
accordance with adopted comprehensive plan policies, and where a development
plan of the city does not indicate proposed public use areas, the Commission
may require the dedication or reservation of areas within the subdivision or
sites of a character, extent and location suitable for the development of
parks and other public use.



      2.   Acquisition by public agency. If the developer is
required to reserve land area for a park, playground or other public use,
such land shall be acquired by the appropriate public agency within 18 months
following plat approval, at a price agreed upon prior to approval of the
plat, or such reservation shall be released to the subdivider.

OVERVIEW OF ARTICLE 12



§ 17.12.000  OVERVIEW OF ARTICLE 12.



   This article establishes the framework for the classification of
individual land uses to broad use categories. Article 12 also includes the
definition of words with specific meaning in the Code. This article should be
used as a cross-reference to other Articles of the Code. The following topics
are covered in this article:



   ∙   Use Categories



   ∙   Definitions



   The table of contents contains a complete list of the material included
in this article.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



USE CATEGORIES



This subarticle classifies land uses and activities into use categories on
the basis of common functional, product or physical characteristics, thereby
providing a consistent basis for the regulation of uses. The use categories
provide a systematic basis for assignment of present and future uses to zones.



§ 17.12.100  CLASSIFICATION OF USES.



   Uses are assigned to the category whose description most closely
describes the nature of the primary uses. When all of the primary uses of a
development fall within one use category, then the development is assigned to
that category. When the primary uses of a development fall within different
use categories, each primary use is classified in the applicable category and
is subject to the regulations for that category.



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)



§ 17.12.105  LISTING OF USE CATEGORIES.



   All uses are classified into one or more of the following use
categories.  In order of listing in this subarticle, they are: Residential,
Civic, Commercial, Industrial and Other. Use types listed within each
category are presented in alphabetical order.



   In addition to use categories, the Code defines residential building
types. Residential building types are listed in each zoning district that
permits residential use from least intensive to most intensive (for example,
“Single Detached” is listed above “Single Attached,” and both of
these building types are listed above “Multi-Family”).



(Ord. 2009-01, passed 3-9-2009)

Examples include nursing/convalescent homes, residential care/treatment
facilities, sororities/fraternities and convents/monasteries. Tenancy is

Why do we need Design Review?



The community of Forest Grove has a desire to maintain its small town
character and enhance the quality and functionality of its built environment.
The Design Review process uses the Design Guidelines in this Handbook to help
achieve this goal. The guidelines help define the City of Forest Grove’s
expectations for development and provide a consistent framework to review
projects according to specific standards and guidelines.



 



Vision for Forest Grove



In 1993, the City adopted a vision statement which establishes a series of
goals for the community to accomplish by the year 2010. Design review is
intended to help the City accomplish the following elements of the vision
statement:



∙   Small town atmosphere. New development should enhance the
community’s existing character and help create a livable community for
residents, workers and visitors.



∙   Vibrant and charming downtown. The focus of the community is
downtown, with its turn-of-the-century charm and well maintained historic
facades. New development should reinforce the positive characteristics of the
town center.



∙   Mobility for residents. While the importance of the auto is
recognized, walking, bicycling and transit use are also important. New
development should ensure that all mobility types are fostered and safety is
enhanced.



∙   A prospering city. New development should promote the growth and
vitality of current business and spur private investment by creating a
quality built environment and predictable development framework.



∙   High environmental quality. “Space to Breathe” is essential to
the community.  New development should help accomplish this by integrating
landscaping, open space and existing natural resources into site designs.   



∙   Essential services well-planned. Design techniques should consider
public safety and security on private property. 



 



Role of Design Review



The design review process recognizes that there are a variety of ways new
development could accomplish design objectives. The purpose of the design
review process is to provide flexibility and creativity in new development
while meeting city requirements and helping projects to achieve community
character objectives.



The design review process is established by the city’s Development Code.
While most developments are subject to the city’s site plan review process,
they may or may not be subject to design review. The design review process
applies only to those projects which are in certain locations – the town
center or commercial corridor – or are of a certain development type –
multi-unit residential, mixed use and commercial buildings. These locations
and types of project have a particular significance and impact on the city
and thus deserve the special attention that the design review process brings
to them.



The projects to which design review applies are divided into four separate
categories or “Focus Areas,” depending on their location and/or type, and
each with its own set of applicable Design Guidelines.  These Focus Areas
are 1) Town Center, 2) Commercial Corridor, 3) Multi-unit Residential, and 4)
Historic Districts, and are outlined in detail in the guidelines that make up
the bulk of this handbook.



 



The Design Review Process – Which Track?



Forest Grove has a “two track” design review process.  For each project
to which design review applies, the applicant selects the track most
appropriate: Track 1, generally more specific and directive, or Track 2,
potentially more flexible.



∙   Track 1: Development Standards. These applicants refer to parts of
the city’s Development Code; the projects are required to meet the clear
and objective development standards which are provided in the code. The
standards establish a baseline for design which works in conjunction with
other requirements of the development code. 



∙   Track 2: Design Guidelines. Track 2 applicants refer to the
Guidelines provided in this document, as well as to applicable provisions of
the Development Code. These projects must meet the development standards, but
would be allowed to vary from these standards if it is demonstrated that
related guidelines and objectives were adequately addressed and that the
deviation results in a higher quality development than would result under a
strict interpretation of the code.



 



The Design Review Process – How Does it Work?



∙   Thefirst step is that the developer meets with city planning staff
in a “pre-app conference” to have an initial discussion about his
project. This meeting should be held early in the development process,
because it is a chance to discuss regulations that will affect the project
before too much design has been done, and to outline how best to proceed.



∙   The developer then selects which design review track to follow, and
submits the drawings required under that track to the City’s Community
Development Department as a “Design Review application.” The developer
has three choices:



   O   Track 1 – offering the clarity and certainty of meeting clear
and objective standards;



   O   Track 2 – offering the flexibility of interpreting the
guideline intentions; or



   O   Combination of Tracks 1 and 2 – a combination approach wherein
the project may be evaluated by the standards for some categories and by
guidelines for the remainder. This “mix-and-match” approach will however
“kick over” the project into the Track 2 review body (see below).



∙   At the city level, who reviews the project depends on its track and
also a size threshold. Smaller projects are reviewed by planning staff in the
Community Development Department, while larger projects are subject to
Planning Commission review. 



   Thus planning staff reviews smaller projects:



   ∙   Multi-unit residential projects of 3-5 units.



   ∙   Commercial developments with a total building size less than
10,000 square feet for Track 1 and 3,000 square feet for Track 2. 



   Planning Commission reviews projects larger than those listed above.
For those larger projects, planning staff prepares a detailed staff report
for the Planning Commissioners, who then use it to review the project and
make a decision after a public hearing.



∙   All appeals go to the City Council. 



∙   If the project is approved by the City (by staff, Planning
Commission, or City Council) the developer may proceed with the building
permit process. 



∙   If the project is not approved, the applicant may redesign the
project and re-submit or appeal to the state Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA).



 



How to Use this Document – Project Design Considerations



While only Track 2 projects are evaluated according to these design
guidelines, this guidelines handbook is intended to be useful to potential
developers who choose Track 1 as well, because it establishes a framework for
the intentions and goals of Forest Grove development. That is, whether a
developer chooses to follow Track 1 or Track 2, or a combination of Tracks 1
and 2, the end result – quality development in Forest Grove – should be
the same. Thus the design considerations covered in these guidelines will be
relevant for any project that is subject to design review. The following
diagram outlines the design considerations which should be addressed by
applicants to achieve the design review goals and be approved. These design
considerations are further explained in the guidelines in the remainder of
this document.







 



 



How to Use this Document – Focus Areas



Since the guidelines are divided into three categories or “Focus Areas”
depending on project location and/or type, each project must address all
guidelines in the Focus Area that applies to it. The general idea of each of
the Focus Areas is as follows:



1.   Town Center. Forest Grove began as a small farming community with a
small downtown and a quality educational institution (now Pacific University)
as its nucleus. Since the community’s inception, the town center has been
important and still maintains much of its turn of the century charm with
numerous intact historic buildings. New development in the town center should
reinforce the small town atmosphere and the positive qualities of the
historic architecture.



2.   Commercial Corridor. Forest Grove has commercial zoned land running
along the Pacific Avenue/ 19th Avenue couplet through town. As the primary
east-west travel route through town, the character of development along this
corridor has a dramatic impact on the perception of the community. New
development should ensure the functionality and improve the visual quality of
the corridor.



3.   Multi-unit Residential. Forest Grove has several areas designated for
moderate to high density residential development. New development should be
compatible with surrounding residential neighborhood and create a safe and
functional living environment for residents. 



4.   Historic Districts and Landmarks. Retention and restoration of
significant architectural features, appropriate use of materials, and
sensitive new design help preserve and improve the integrity of individual
buildings, and the district as a whole. In this regard, the following
collective actions help ensure long-term historic district success.



∙    Maintain the architectural design, pattern, and details of the
original construction and site.



∙    Maintain the original building materials and use original
construction methods.



∙    Administer new construction that’s historically representative of
the structure or the district.



 



Each Focus Area guidelines section is subdivided into four categories:



1) Site



2) Building



3) Lighting



4) Signs 



 



Each of these categories in turn includes:



1) Specific guidelines



2) Descriptive statements



3) Examples of recommended and not recommended types of development.



 



How to Use this Document – Approval Criteria



In addition to meeting the specific guidelines within each focus area, all
development must meet a list of five approval criteria. The purpose of the
approval criteria is to ensure that, when combined, all the individual
elements of a proposed development result in a high quality project that
emphasizes the unique characteristics of Forest Grove. The premise is that
“the whole should be greater than the sum of its parts.”  The approval
criteria are as follows:



   1.   Complement Existing Architecture. New development shall be
consistent with the quality and character of existing architecture in the
community.



   2.   Compatible multi-unit housing and mixed-use areas. New
development shall be compatible with other types of uses and provide a safe
pedestrian environment for residents.



   3.   Dramatic landscape statements. New development shall protect
important trees and include dramatic landscape treatments.



   4.   Sensitivity to the natural environment. New development shall
enhance natural resources and incorporate them into the site plan for the
enjoyment of residents.



   5.   Well-designed streetscapes. New development shall establish a
template for on-site and public improvements to ensure consistency with City
standards.



 



Section I
Town Center Focus Area



Overview



Forest Grove began as a small farming community with a small downtown and a
quality educational institution (now Pacific University) at its center. Since
the community’s inception, the town center has been important and still
maintains much of its turn of the century charm with numerous intact historic
buildings. 



This section, Focus Area I, establishes specific design review guidelines for
new development in the Town Center. The primary intent of the Town Center
Focus Area is to reinforce the existing positive qualities of the
architecture and streetscape. While the City is not seeking new development
to replicate the architecture of existing buildings, new projects should use
design elements that reinforce or enhance the character of the Town Center.



 



Applicability



The City has two town center zones, listed below and illustrated in the map
on the following page (Unless otherwise noted, Design Guidelines apply
uniformly to both zones.)



∙   Town Center Core (TCC) provides for a concentration of retail and
office needs in the core commercial area of the city.  Retail or office uses
are required on the ground floor, with an emphasis on those uses that serve a
walk-in clientele. A combination of office and residential uses are allowed
on upper floors. Design components should work together to form a unified
district. Architectural elements should form a continuous and interesting
storefront façade featuring streetscape amenities for the pedestrian shopper.



∙   Town Center Transition (TCT) is similar in form and specific street
front characteristics to the TCC with the primary difference being that
retail uses are not required on the ground floor, and therefore the vibrant
streetscape may also include residential or office activities.



In cases where a development falls into both the Town Center Focus Area and
another Focus Area, both sets of guidelines may apply, but where they
conflict the guidelines for the Town Center take precedence.



The following section is divided into four general categories:



      ∙    Site



      ∙    Building



      ∙    Lighting



      ∙    Signs



Each category has a set of corresponding design objectives, guidelines and
standards, and is further divided into sub-categories as necessary.

SITE DESIGN GUIDELINES



Intent – Provide a functional and safe environment for vehicles and
pedestrians, where the needs of pedestrian are emphasized. The Town Center
should have a clear separation between pedestrian and vehicular areas. The
Town Center should be comfortable and safe in all seasons and hours of the
day. 



The Site Design section features the following guidelines:



      ∙    Building Orientation



      ∙    Pedestrian Connections



      ∙    Amenities



 



SITE – BUILDING ORIENTATION



Guideline – Design and construct buildings oriented to a public street
right-of-way to create safe, pleasant and active pedestrian environments.



Description – Development in the town center area should create a well
defined, safe, attractive and active pedestrian environment.  Zero lot line
development should be encouraged in all town center zones, particularly the
Town Center Core. Parking should be behind or to the side of buildings, so as
to not obstruct pedestrian pathways to the front door of buildings. If
buildings are setback from the sidewalk, the area in front of the building
should be well landscaped or used as an expanded sidewalk area or a
pedestrian plaza. 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Minimize building setbacks from any public street right-of-way. 
Zero lot line buildings along the public street right-of-way are encouraged
to maintain an inviting and continuous storefront presentation.



∙    Design and construct a primary building entrance for each building
façade.  If a building has frontage on more than one public street, a
single building entrance on the corner is acceptable.



∙    Use the area between the right-of-way and building to create a
plaza court, planter area, bicycle parking or another amenity.



∙    Main entrance should be oriented to the street.


 

Not Recommended


∙    Parking located between the building façade and the street.

∙    TCT:  Building facades shall be built along at least 75% of the
primary building frontage line.



∙    One (1) entrance shall be provided for each building façade. When
building is located on a corner, one entrance at the corner is permitted.



∙    If a building is setback from right-of-way, it shall be a minimum
of four feet (4’) in depth and include plazas, forecourts or other paved
areas for public seating, artwork and landscaped planting beds.



∙    If a building is setback from the right-of-way, mechanical units,
meters or other above grade or wall mounted utilities shall not be located in
the front setback area.




 



 







 



 



SITE – PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIONS



Guideline – Develop continuous pedestrian connections that are attractive
and convenient.



Description – The Town Center area must maintain a clear and comfortable
separation between vehicles and pedestrians. Where vehicles and pedestrians
must share the same space, pedestrian safety and comfort must not be
compromised. Sidewalks should be continuous and free of barriers.

Section II
Commercial Corridor Focus Area



Overview



The majority of commercial zoned land in Forest Grove is located along
Pacific Avenue and the Pacific Avenue / 19th Avenue couplet. As the primary
east-west travel route through town, the character of development along this
corridor has a dramatic impact on the perception of the community.  The
primary purpose of design review along the commercial corridor is to ensure
the functionality, encourage new quality development and improve the visual
quality of the corridor. 



The purpose of this section is to establish specific design review
requirements for commercial areas in Forest Grove. The guidelines are
intended to respond to typical commercial development common to Forest Grove
and Washington County and are not intended to prescribe a particular
development type.  The common types include:



   1.   Contemporary Shopping Center- Anchor use with adjacent pad
sites.



   2.   Boulevard Retail – Anchor use plus smaller commercial
building(s) or a collection of smaller commercial buildings set along
boulevard or frontage road.



   3.   Internal Shopping Street – Anchor use plus smaller commercial
buildings or a collection of smaller commercial buildings oriented to an
internal “main street.”



Much of Forest Grove’s current inventory of commercial development consists
of free-standing single use commercial structures. These are usually small
one-story buildings or former residential structures converted into
commercial uses. As commercial construction occurs, these small single use
structures are encouraged to cluster to create shopping and/or office
“nodes” according to the development types listed above.



 



Applicability



The City has a variety of zoning districts which are designated for
commercial development:



   ∙    Community Commercial (CC);



   ∙    Commercial Planned Development (CPD);



   ∙    Commercial Neighborhood (CN).



The design review process outlined in this section applies to commercial
development in these districts. 



For commercial development located within town center zones Town Center
Design Review standards will take precedence and apply to the development. 



 



Categories



The Commercial Corridor Design Guidelines section is divided into four
general categories. Each category has a set of corresponding design
objectives, guidelines and standards. Each general category is further
divided into sub-categories as necessary: 



      ∙    Site



      ∙    Buildings



      ∙    Lighting



      ∙    Signs

SITE DESIGN GUIDELINES



Intent – Provide a pleasant, safe and functional environment for
pedestrians and vehicles. Commercial development should be of a high quality
and visually appealing from the adjacent street right-of-way and adjacent
residential neighborhoods.   



The Site Design section features the following guidelines, described in
detail on the pages that follow:

Guideline - Encourage attractive, convenient and functional site design,
which minimizes conflicts among pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles.



Description – Commercial property in Forest Grove is concentrated along the
Pacific Avenue / 19th Avenue couplet -- the primary transportation route for
automobiles, mass transit, bicycles and pedestrians.  While all of these
modes of transportation should be accommodated in a safe, functional and
visually appealing manner, development should ensure that the pedestrian is
the priority.

BUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES



Intent – Promote building design that enhances and unifies the Commercial
Corridor, while connecting it to and reinforcing the character of Forest
Grove. Allow various development types to be used with an overall effect of
cohesiveness and pleasant pedestrian environment as a result. The following
specific guidelines are included:



      ∙    Massing and Form



      ∙    Design Elements



      ∙    Compatibility



      ∙    Safety



 



 



BUILDING – MASSING AND FORM



Guideline – Structures should be designed so that the effect of their
overall proportions and shapes is harmonious with and complementary to
adjoining properties.



Description – The three dimensional bulk of a structure can erode the
neighborhood fabric and separate and isolate surrounding neighborhoods. The
sculptural proportions of a building should be molded to enhance and
contribute to the area’s character and quality. The commercial development
should not create a chaotic, confusing discordance; nor should it overwhelm
the site, landscape or nearby neighborhoods. Instead it should be a “good
neighbor” by avoiding disruptive excesses, providing graceful transitions
in massing, form and height with nearby neighborhoods.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1- Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Avoid long, horizontally-oriented monotonous exterior walls and/or
mitigate their effect by breaking down large masses into small vertical
volumes.



∙    Divide large masses by varying façade heightsand rooflines.



∙    Use columns, pilasters or other vertical elements to create a
vertical rather than horizontal building expression.



∙    Differentiate the pedestrian level of the building through the use
of varied materials, banding, coursing or other treatment.



∙    Minimize the appearance of building bulk with building offset
intervals established and repeated along the structure facades.



∙    Provide an appropriate transition between new buildings and
existing adjacent buildings through the use of similar massing, height or
setback.



∙    Line large footprint retail shops with multiple narrow retail
storefronts.



∙    Encourage development of two-story or mezzanine retail anchor to
reduce footprint area.



∙    Break up the roofline silhouette through the use of large cornices,
changes in parapet heights or other techniques.


 

Not Recommended

Section III
Multi-Unit Residential Focus Area



Overview



Forest Grove has several areas designated for moderate to high density
residential development. These areas are generally in or close to the town
center and commercial corridor. The character of multi-unit residential
development should help provide a transition between the more urban character
of commercial areas and lower density residential areas. Design review can
help ensure that new development is compatible with surrounding residential
neighborhoods and can create a safe and functional living environment for
residents. 



The purpose of this section is to establish specific design review
requirements for multi-unit residential development. Multi-unit residential
development is defined as one or more residential structures containing more
than one dwelling unit. The guidelines are intended not to be prescriptive
but rather to meet a variety of multi-unit quality housing types commonly
found in Forest Grove and Washington County:



   ∙    Townhouse – 8-15 du/ac



   ∙    Courtyard/Garden – 16-23 du/ac



   ∙    Condominium/Loft/Urban Housing – 24 du/ac and above



Applicability



The City has a variety of areas that are designated for multi-unit housing.
Primarily, multi-unit housing is focused on land zoned either:



   ∙    Residential Multi-unit Low (RML).



   ∙    Residential Multi-unit High (RMH). 



Land zoned Community Commercial (CC) and Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) also
allows multi-unit development. The design standards and guidelines in this
section apply to multi-unit development in these districts, with multi-unit
being defined as buildingswhich include at least three dwelling units.
However, within the NMU Zone, these standards may be modified through an
approved Mixed-Use Planned Development (MUPD). 



While multi-unit residential development is also allowed in Town Center
zones, its character in those areas can be significantly different from that
of the Commercial Corridor and residential zoning districts. Residential
development in the Town Center is subject to the Town Center Guidelines found
in Section I.



In the RML, RMH, CC and NMU zones, these multi-unit residential design
guidelines apply to the multi-unit types as follows:



   ∙    Single-family attached developments with three or more units
(i.e. townhouse, courtyard).



   ∙    Duplex developments with at least two duplexes (i.e.
courtyard/loft/urban housing).



   ∙    Apartment buildings with three or more units (i.e.
courtyard/loft/urban housing).



The following guidelines section is divided into four categories, with
sub-categories provided as necessary within each. Each category has a set of
corresponding design objectives, guidelines and standards: 



         ∙    Site
Lighting                  ∙    Lighting



         ∙   
Signs                     ∙    Building



 



 



SITE DESIGN GUIDELINES



Intent – Provide a functional and safe environment for vehicles and
pedestrians.  Multi-unit development should be visual appealing from the
adjacent street right-of-way and adjacent residential neighborhoods.   



The Site Design section features the following guidelines. A page is
dedicated to each:



      ∙    Circulation



      ∙    Parking



      ∙    Pedestrian Environment



      ∙    Screening/Service Areas



      ∙    Landscaping

      ∙    Open Space



 



 



SITE - CIRCULATION



Guideline - Encourage aesthetically pleasing and functional site design,
which minimizes vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian conflicts and creates a safe
environment for all users.



Description – A functional vehicle circulation system should be emphasized,
as well as pedestrian safety. Vehicle circulation and parking areas should be
separated from pedestrian areas where possible.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Vehicles should access site from collector or local roadways. 
Where arterials are used for access, driveway should be combined with
adjacent developments.



∙    Access parking lots or structures from alleys or common driveways
when appropriate.



∙    Interconnect the vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems of
adjacent developments.

minimizing curb cuts along the public streets.



∙    Provide comprehensive, pleasant and direct pedestrian pathways
linking buildings, open space and parking areas.



∙    Clearly and directly link public right of way – streets and
sidewalks – to building front doors with a minimum of vehicular crossings.



∙    Use traffic calming elements to reduce traffic speed.  Elements
should be compatible with the site’s landscape plan.



∙    Provide adequate circulation for services (garbage collection,
etc.) to avoid excessive turning or backing up of vehicles.


 


Not Recommended

Guideline - Create parking areas which are efficient and function well for
automobiles yet minimize the negative impact on buildings on site or in
adjacent neighborhoods.



Description – Parking should be located to provide convenient and safe
access to residential units while minimizing views from the street
right-of-way and adjacent existing development. Landscaping or other
well-designed screening devices should be used to buffer views of parking
lots from street right-of-way and adjacent properties.

buildings to parking area(s).




 



 



SITE – PEDESTRIAN ENVIRONMENT



Guideline – Create safe, pleasant and active streets and public spaces.



Description – Pedestrian areas should be functional and inviting, providing
the multi-unit residential development with amenities. These areas should
enhance the feeling of community and increase the ability for neighbors to
meet. Development of public courts, plazas and squares is encouraged.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Provide pedestrian amenities such as benches for a pleasant and
inviting place to sit, rest, linger and meet.



∙    Safely separate pedestrian areas from vehicle traffic by providing
street trees along sidewalks as buffers.



∙    Provide an active ground floor environment along all pedestrian
streets and public courts, plazas and squares. That is, design buildings with
transparent windows and doors.



∙    Develop public spaces – plazas, squares or other open spaces that
are “activated” by building entries and locate uses that encourage foot
traffic.


Not Recommended


∙    Pedestrian-only streets or corridors.



∙    Indirect pedestrian routes.



∙    Pedestrian routes blocked by obstructions or barriers including

Example: Residential Entries Oriented to Sidewalk and Transitions







 



 



 



SITE – SCREENING/SERVICE AREAS



Guideline - Screen “objectionable views” from residential dwellings,
adjacent properties and public rights-of-way.



Description – Residential developments should create a pleasant visual
environment. One way to accomplish this is to screen views of loading areas,
mechanical/electrical equipment and dumpster and recycling collection areas
from both within the site and off-site.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines

to provide screening of garbage collection and storage areas from above.



∙    All roof mounted mechanical equipment other than vents shall be
screened from ground level view.  The screening shall be as high as the
height of the equipment and shall be integrated with the exterior building
façade.










 



SITE – LANDSCAPING



Guideline – Use landscaping to enhance character and visual quality of
residential developments.



Description – Landscaping can help provide a quality environment for
residents and help achieve compatibility with surrounding land uses. A mix of
landscaping treatments and techniques can provide appropriate separation
between adjacent properties, screen objectionable views, provide visual
relief, and create weather protection.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Plant landscaping to define and accentuate entry ways.



∙    Provide landscape elements along all exterior walls to soften the
visual impact of the building and promote residential character of the site.



∙    Use landscaping and/or fencing to buffer multi-unit development
from abutting properties and enhance privacy of dwelling units, especially by
landscaping setback areas.



∙    Distribute canopy trees along roadways; provide landscape buffers
along edges of developed areas and throughout parking areas.



∙    Large species street trees should be planted to provide shade and
emphasize the residential character of the site.


Not Recommended


∙    Removing significant trees.



∙    Landscaping that creates a pedestrian physical barrier between
walkways, gathering areas and building entries.



∙    Use of non-native, noxious, or invasive plant materials.


∙    Parking lot landscaping that creates pedestrian physical or visual
barriers between walkways and building entries
 

Related Code Standards (§17.8.140)



∙    Landscaping standards vary depending on zoning, use, adjacent
zoning, and existing site conditions.



∙    At least 75% of required landscaped area shall be planted with any
suitable combination of trees, shrubs, or evergreen ground cover.



∙    A maximum of 25 % of required landscaped area may include
architectural features or artificial ground covers such as sculptures,
benches, masonry or stone walls, rock groupings, decorative hard paving and
gravel areas interspersed with planting areas.



∙    Buffering and screening is required as specified in §17.8.425.







 









SITE – CRIME PREVENTION THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (CPTED)



Guideline – Consider crime prevention and the safety of residents in site
design and use of landscaping. 



Description – Crime prevention through environmental design is a proven
concept that has been used to enhance the safety of residents and address the
crime problem that afflicts many communities by ensuring that the right type
of landscaping is used. The conspicuous presence of people increases
surveillance, which discourages criminals. More people outdoors means that
threatening behavior is more likely to be observed. At the same time,
potential criminals sense that they are being noticed and watched. The green
and groomed appearance of an apartment building is itself a cue that
residents and owners care about a property, and watch over it and each other.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Plant landscaping and install fencing that does not obscure visual
surveillance of common open space, parking areas or entryways.

or kitchens face common open space and pedestrian paths to allow visual
surveillance by residents of these areas.



∙    Install lighting that illuminates all exterior dwelling unit
entrances, pedestrian walkways and parking areas within the project site.


 

Not Recommended


∙    Design elements that create an uninviting or fortress-like
atmosphere.



∙    Design techniques that reduce or infringe on the privacy of
residents both indoor and outdoors.

 

Related Code Standards



∙    No landscaping, fences, walls or plant materials greater than 5
feet in height shall be installed which obstruct the visibility of a dwelling

SITE – OPEN SPACE



Guideline – Provide accessible and usable open space for all residents of
multi-unit developments.



Description – Open space is important in multi-unit developments to provide
for active and passive recreational uses. Open space should be both usable
and provide visual delight. The protection and integration of natural
resources should be fostered.

outdoor space, such as a plaza, square, courtyard, allee (long linear space
flanked by trees planted at even intervals on either side), or “outdoor
room.”



∙    Orient open space “outdoor rooms” and courtyards to the street
and enclose edges with residences.



∙    Front doors should engage open space.



∙    Promote open space areas that can accommodate recreation and other
intended activities.

space shall count towards meeting this requirement.



∙    All multi-unit development over 5 units shall provide usable
recreation areas at a rate of 100 square feet per units with a minimum
dimension of 20 feet.



∙    All multi-unit developments over twenty (20) units shall provide
children’s play area(s).  Install a fence a minimum of thirty (30) inches
in height to separate a parking lot, street, or driveway from any
children’s play area.



∙    A minimum of 50 square feet of private open shall be provided with
a minimum dimension of 6 feet. Private open space shall be directly
accessible from unit.



∙    Private open space shall be separated from common open space
through the use of perimeter landscaping, fencing or a change in vertical
grade (e.g., second floor balconies).




 








BUILDING GUIDELINES



Intent – Promote building elements that unify the residential neighborhoods
and reinforce the character of Forest Grove.  The following specific
guidelines are included:



      ∙    Massing and Form



      ∙    Compatibility



      ∙    Safety



      ∙    Privacy



 



 



BUILDING – MASSING AND FORM



Guideline – The bulk and character of structures should enhance the public
realm and be cohesive with adjacent homes or businesses. Buildings should be
designed to relate to human scale.



Description – Multi-unit buildings should be harmonious with existing
Forest Grove neighborhoods. In cases where new multi-unit structures will be
larger than structures on adjacent properties, the new buildings should be
designed so that they do not overwhelm, create discordance or contrast
dramatically.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Site building with sensitivity to topography, natural land form and
significant trees.



∙    Avoid long monotonous exterior walls; create a comfortable sense of
rhythm by breaking the linear thrust of a building by dividing the mass into
a series of vertical elements.



∙    Minimize the appearance of building bulk with building offset
intervals established and repeated along the structure facades.



∙    Group collections of buildings to create courtyard or “outdoor
room” providing visual amenity and useable space for residents.



∙    For higher density projects, the building mass should engage the
public realm – streets and/or open space.



∙    Landscaping and open space are recommended to break up the mass of
townhome/rowhouse development.


 

Not Recommended


∙    Avoid repetitive “cookie-cutter” massing of townhomes or other
multi-unit buildings.



∙    Disorder/lack of human scale/rhythm



∙    Building massing and forms that stand out or erode the neighborhood
fabric.



∙    Massing without vertical variations in roof height.


 
 

Related Code Standards



∙    On lots with an average cross slope of 15% or more, no more than
60%of the site shall be re-graded.



∙    No building shall have a dimension greater than one-hundred and
fifty (150) feet without a minimum three (3) feet off-set of the exterior
wall.



∙    At a minimum, every two dwelling units shall be offset from the
next dwelling unit by at least four (4) feet in depth.



∙    All habitable room shall incorporate at least one window when
facing parking lots and common areas.














BUILDING – COMPATIBILITY



Guideline - Encourage design which provides visual linkages between proposed
development and adjoining existing buildings.



Description - Much of the land zoned for multi-unit development is currently
occupied by single-family homes. New multi-unit development should “fit”
by relating to surrounding architecture through use of common elements of
scale, color, rhythm and proportion in similar ways as existing buildings.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Design buildings to provide an appropriate transition between new
buildings and adjacent buildings.



∙    Use architectural elements and façade materials consistently
throughout the site.



∙    Locate and treat entries similar to that of existing adjacent or
neighborhood buildings (for example, providing roof, awning, or portico).



∙    Use similar landscaping, setback, spacing and orientation of
buildings that strengthens and contributes to character and identity of the
neighborhood.



∙    Use similar façade materials, colors and treatments of existing
buildings.



∙    Repeat, strengthen and expand upon building elements that create a
unified street edge – i.e., window placement, belt coursings, etc.






Not Recommended



∙    Literal interpretation of existing buildings.



∙    Surface materials, building textures or colors that vary greatly
with nearby development.



∙    Proportions of windows, doorways, bays and other features that vary
greatly with nearby development.




 

Related Code Standards



∙    Setback requirements vary by building height (see §17.3.130 Table
3-7)



∙    All buildings shall incorporate a porch or architecturally defined
entry space for each ground level dwelling unit with a minimum area of 16
square feet per dwelling unit, with no dimension less than 4 feet. Shared
porches or entry spaces are permitted. All grade level porches shall include
hand-railing, half-walls, or shrubs to define their outside perimeter.


 













BUILDING – SAFETY



Guideline – Create development which provides a safe environment for all
users.



Description – Residents and visitors need to feel secure yet welcome
throughout multi-unit residential developments. This can be accomplished
through building design and lighting that provide security without creating a
fortress.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Design building so that building entries are clearly visible from
within buildings as well as from the sidewalks, streets and parking areas.



∙    Light building entryways, parking areas and pedestrian pathways
pleasantly and sufficiently to achieve safety.



∙    Locate buildings and entries so that they are easily accessible to
emergency responders.






Not Recommended



∙    Reflective or tinted glass at street level.



∙    Lighting that casts glare or creates dark shadows.



∙    Bars, gates or other security design elements that cannot be
rolled-up and /or hidden from view during business hours.



∙    Security lighting, cameras or other elements that overwhelm or
become an explicit architectural feature of the building facade.


 
 

Related Code Standards



∙    A clear line of site between all front building entries and the
public sidewalk or parking areas shall be maintained.







 



 



BUILDING – PRIVACY



Guideline – Ensure that the essential privacy needs of residents is
provided for while simultaneously maintaining the sense of communal
interaction, contact and relationship that creates or strengthens a
neighborhood.



Description – A successful residential development balances and achieves
its people’s needs for essential privacy with their desires for differing
degrees of community interaction. The relationship of a residence to the
public realm is often confused: either the dwelling is exposed tentatively to
the street, parking lot or neighbor and there is no privacy; or the dwelling
turns its back to the street, open space or neighbor and communion with the
district is lost. New development should strive to support both needs.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Set back or raise elevation of interior living spaces from streets,
parking areas and pathways to provide a visual separation.



∙    Provide visual separation of bedrooms, bathrooms and other
“private” rooms between adjoining buildings and public areas. Consider
use of window offsets, windows placed above eye level, or frosted or diffused
glazing.



∙    Provide a transition between the public realm and private space. 
Use terraces, porches, stoops or other techniques.



∙    Selectively use fences and walls to enclose private spaces within
interior courts, greenways or other spaces.


 

Not Recommended


∙    Guard-gated community development.



∙    Security walls or fences along public rights-of-way.



∙    Blank walls and inwardly-oriented “compound”-like development.


 
 

Related Code Standards



∙    Front entryways into dwelling units shall be separated vertically
or horizontally a minimum of three feet from sidewalks used by more than one
dwelling unit.



∙    Bedroom and bathroom windows shall be offset a minimum of four (4)
feet from windows on adjacent buildings (unless window glazing is frosted,
diffused or glass block).














LIGHTING GUIDELINES



Intent – Lighting should provide security in residential areas and
highlight building and landscape features. Utilitarian lighting creating
excessive glare and spilling over onto adjacent properties is discouraged.



SITE LIGHTING



Guideline – Lighting should be attractive, uniform in appearance and help
provide a safe environment.



Description – Lighting should be used in parking areas to improve
visibility and create a safe environment; along pedestrian routes to ensure
visibility and used to highlight building and landscape features.



 



 



 

Track 2 - Design Guidelines
 
Track 1 - Development Standards



Recommended



∙    Lighting should illuminate all exterior dwelling unit entrances,
pedestrian walkways and parking areas.



∙    Lighting of walkways, path intersections, seating areas and any
other pedestrian areas which may require lighting for a feeling of security.



∙    Area lighting should be directed downward with no splay of light
off the site.



∙    Light posts should be located in landscape areas to protect
fixtures from automobile damage and keep pedestrian ways clear of
obstructions.



∙    Night lighting of buildings should be done to highlight special
features, or to articulate the façade.



∙    Architectural lighting should be direct, as wall washing, overhead
dawn lighting or interior illumination radiating outside. The visual effect
achieved should complement the building character.



∙    Sign lighting should be designed as integral to the site, building,
and sign composition. Low voltage lighting is preferred.






Not Recommended



∙    Concrete light fixtures should be no taller than 8”



∙    Car park lighting should be designed to avoid unnecessary
illumination of residential areas.

∙    Plastic signs with an internal light source are prohibited.













 



SIGN GUIDELINES



Intent – Signs should be architecturally compatible and contribute to the
visual quality of residential neighborhoods. A consistent application of
signs is important to create a pleasing visual environment while allowing for
flexibility and creativity. Appropriately designed signs can reinforce the
character of Forest Grove. 



Sign guidelines describe recommended characteristics for signs as follows.



SIGNS



Guideline - Signs should be designed with the purpose of providing relevant
information and accenting the visual quality of the building.



Description – Use high quality signs made of durable materials and designed
to be consistent with and enhance the character of Forest Grove.

Section IV
Approval Criteria



Overview



The applicant should address how well the proposed plan promotes the unique
character of Forest Grove. New development shall reinforce positive
characteristics of town center, improve visual character of commercial
corridor and complement the character of neighborhoods. Each building or
addition shall fit within the context of its greater surroundings and
environment in terms of overall street impact, scale and configuration.



Forest Grove has unique characteristics derived from its history; role as a
regional center for the surrounding agricultural areas; and relationship to
institutional uses, such as Pacific University. Property developed within the
City has certain design characteristics, which should be emphasized by new
development.



In the Town Center, new development should enhance the historic character of
the town center. Buildings which disrupt the character would not meet the
criteria. In all focus areas, projects should be functionally and
aesthetically compatible with surrounding properties and the community as a
whole. Multi-unit residential projects should be compatible with adjacent
neighborhoods and create a safe and functional environment for residents. 



All projects subject to design review shall demonstrate that they meet the
five approval criteria listed below and described on the following pages. The
applicant should include a written response to each criterion as part of the
design review application. 



      1.   Complements existing architecture



      2.   Compatible with adjacent neighborhood



      3.   Creates dramatic landscape statements



      4.   Sensitivity to the natural environment



      5.   Promotes well-designed streetscapes

Criterion 1 – Complements Existing Architecture



New development shall be consistent with the quality and character of
existing architecture in the community.



Forest Grove has a number of architecturally significant and well-designed
institutional, commercial and residential buildings, some dating back to the
early 1850s (e.g. Old College Hall, 1850).  These structures enhance the
community character of the community and establish a high-quality design
standard.



Development should maintain and restore significant historic details on
existing buildings. New buildings should be architecturally compatible with
neighboring buildings. New buildings built in Forest Grove should enhance,
rather than detract from the existing character of the community. The desired
architectural character should vary depending on the location within the
community. Large monolithic buildings lacking architectural details are
discouraged.



 



 



Top: View of a renovated historic building in the town center located on Main
Street.



Bottom: View of Goodwill store on Pacific Avenue.







 



 



Criterion 2 - Compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods. 



Multi-unit residential developments shall be compatible with adjacent lower
density residential development, as well as commercial development. 



Some of the earliest buildings in the town center were hotels (as early as
1870) and dormitories for the college. Many of the early twentieth century
downtown buildings featured apartments above the storefronts. The
neighborhoods immediately surrounding the town center and along Forest
Grove’s commercial corridor have historically contained some higher density
housing intermixed with single family homes.  The community also has a
number of elderly housing facilities. Many residents of these housing types
have limited access to vehicles and need a safe walking environment.  Three
different types of built environments allow multi-unit development in Forest
Grove: town center, commercial corridor and residential neighborhoods. 



New development should provide safe pedestrian environments, be accessible to
nearby commercial areas and provide a safe, well designed atmosphere to meet
the needs of residents. Project which are disconnected from surrounding
neighborhood (e.g. lacking pedestrian connections, excessive setbacks, large
parking areas, no visibility from public streets) are discouraged.



 



 



Top: Well-designed modern apartment complex.



Bottom: Upper level residential units.







 



 



Criterion 3 – Creates Dramatic Landscape Statements. 



Landscaping shall be used to create a design theme for a project, complement
the building architecture, screen objectionable views and enhance privacy.



Landscape features are key determinant of community character in the city. 
Forest Grove was named for a grove of large trees present on the Tualatin
Academy campus in the 1840s.  The community has several examples of dramatic
landscaping treatments (e.g. City’s eastern entrance; historic Grand Lodge)
which helps define its character. Forest Grove is also a “Tree City USA”
and has a recognition program for significant trees. 



Landscaping should be used to create a design theme for a project.
Landscaping should be integrated into the design of developments, to
complement building architecture and create visual relief. Landscaping should
also be used to screen objectionable views and enhance privacy. Landscaping
should also be used for environmental benefits, such as reducing storm-water
run-off and providing shade. Landscaping that blocks visibility creates
safety concerns and interferes with utilities should be avoided. The use of
invasive non-native species is discouraged.

Middle: Landscaping along public street.



Bottom: Entrance sign with landscaping at apartment complex.







 



 



Criterion 4 - Sensitivity to the Natural Environment. 



Site plans shall be designed to avoid impacts to natural resources and
integrate these resources into site plans for the enjoyment of residents. 



The citizens of Forest Grove have a long tradition of respect for the natural
environment. In fact, one of the early ordinances adopted by the City was a
tree preservation ordinance.  The early settlement of the city was sited
between two major waterways and until recently has primarily developed away
from the floodplains and wetlands associated with these waterways, avoiding
impacts to natural riparian systems.  The city has also avoided impact to
natural resources by developing in a relatively compact fashion.  When near
natural resources, new developments are required to avoid potential impacts.



Site plans should avoid impacts to natural resources. Natural resources
should be integrated into developments for the enjoyment of residents.
Existing trees should be avoided when possible.  Development that utilizes
extensive paved areas and degrades wetlands or riparian areas should be
avoided.

Criterion 5 – Promotes Well-Designed Streetscapes.



Public Improvements made along street rights-of-way shall be consistent with
City standards. Site improvements shall be functionally and visually
connected to adjacent streets and sidewalks. 



New development provided the opportunity to improve the appearance and
construct a unified streetscape.  Streetscapes should be constructed
according to a common “design template” established for the project and
consistent with the character of Forest Grove. Site improvements should be
both functionally and visually connected to adjacent streets and sidewalks.

Introduction



These Historic District Design Guidelines have been developed to provide
property owners and the Historic Landmarks Board with guidance for the
preservation, restoration, rehabilitation and maintenance of historic
landmarks, and new construction within Forest Grove’s historic districts. 
They are based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation.



Retention and restoration of significant architectural features, appropriate
use of materials, and sensitive new design help preserve and improve the
integrity of individual buildings, and the district as a whole. In this
regard, the following collective actions help ensure long-term historic
district success.



   ∙    Maintain the architectural design, pattern, and details of
the original construction and site.



   ∙    Maintain the original building materials and use original
construction methods.



   ∙    Administer new construction that’s historically
representative of the structure or the district.



 



 



Guidelines and Standards



In the interest of flexibility, the strategy adopted by Forest Grove to
accomplish the above integrates both guidelines and standards:



Development Standards: Clear, objective, and verifiable requirements provided
in the code that protect Forest Grove’s architectural heritage. These
standards establish a baseline for design, which works in conjunction with
other requirements of the Development Code.



Design Guidelines: Recognizing that no set of standards can be perfect, the
guidelines provide guidance on how construction might deviate from the
standards, and yet still accomplish the goal of protecting our architectural
heritage. All projects must meet the development standards. But, projects
would be permitted to deviate from the standards in some ways, if it is
demonstrated that the related design guidelines have been addressed, and that
deviations would result in a higher quality development.



In practice, this strategy engenders a two-track procedure. Designs or
portions of a project not meeting, or those requesting an exception to the
Standards [Track 1] shall be reviewed under the Design Guidelines [Track 2].
Correspondingly, a two-column approach has been adopted in the body of this
document.



Labeled “Track 1, Development Standards”, the right-hand column assumes
that a project meets all the requirements set forth in the Design Standards
(Development Code (DC) §17.5.220:  Procedure for Review of Proposed Work
Affecting the Exterior of Landmarks). The body of this column presents a
summary of the development standards that apply to the particular section,
plus illustrative photos. (For the actual wording of the design standards,
see §17.5.220 cited above.)



Labeled “Track 2, Design Guidelines”, the left-hand column gives the
guidelines and illustrative photos that provide information on how a project
might deviate from the development standards that are summarized in the
right-hand column. Projects that elect to follow Track 2 (versus Track 1)
must receive Historic Landmarks Board approval.



 



Applicability



The development standards in this section apply to the exterior
rehabilitation of buildings within one of the historic districts. Situations
include existing historic contributing buildings, additions or new
development, and to individually listed historic resources outside of the
districts. Certain provisions apply to all properties.



The development standards themselves make recommendations that can be applied
to many different resource types, including buildings, sites, structures,
objects, and districts. There are additional considerations that may affect
preservation or rehabilitation projects, including land use and building
codes.



Before undertaking any exterior work on historic resources, §17.5.200 et.
seq.  Historic Landmarks should be followed. These design guidelines are
consistent with the City’s ordinances.



Please note that those properties receiving tax benefits through the Oregon
Special Assessment Program are subject to stricter standards for historic
compatibility and require approval from the State Historic Preservation
Office. 



Properties within the historic districts may be eligible for benefits if
qualifications are met, including the City’s Historic Preservation
Renovation Grants (a matching grant program). Information about Renovation
Grants is available on the City’s website (www.forestgrove-or.gov).



 



History of Building Types in Forest Grove:



Because the districts developed over several years in conjunction with the
overall growth and development of Forest Grove, they not only represent the
broad spectrum of community residents, they also represent a wide range of
architectural styles and trends, including local variations. In general,
houses built for the working class were smaller and less elaborate than
houses built for the middle and upper classes. Merchants and professionals
were more inclined and better able to afford elaborate houses designed by
architects and constructed with the finest materials.



Architectural styles and their variants built in Forest Grove during the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries are indicated in Table 1.

Wood was the most commonly used building material in the historic districts.
Most of the historic buildings are of wood-framed construction with some form
of wood siding. Windows, doors, and architectural ornamentations were wooden.
Many of the early homes in Forest Grove had only rudimentary foundations; but
over time, this changed. Currently, almost all historic buildings sit on
either poured concrete or concrete block foundations; however, some
founda-tions are composed of concrete and stone or concrete and brick. Many
early roofs in Forest Grove were built using wood shingles, with composition
roofing introduced in the early 1900s. There are a number of examples of
historically significant houses, both in and outside of the districts, built
using the “Taylor Process Hollow Wall Concrete Construction” patented
method developed in the 1920s. This construction utilized a concrete double
wall with an air space. Most of these structures are clad with stucco but
have wood-framed roofing systems.



There are historically significant non-residential buildings located in each
of the historic districts.  Central School, located in the Clark District,
is an excellent example of the 20th Century Period Revival style of
architecture with Tudor style elements. Typical of schools built in the
1930s, Central School is of brick construction. Historic churches in the
districts display the typical Gothic Revival elements, most commonly in the
arched windows. The original portions of these churches were often
constructed of wood, although later additions include materials such as brick
and stucco.



Among the architects and builders who contributed to the development of
Forest Grove were Harley McDonald, William Borchardt, E.M. Jerome, F.M.
Starrett, Francis Large, John Taylor, Moore and Loynes, and Higgins and
Biederman.



 



Definitions And Explanations Used In The Guidelines



Basement: A level that is below grade where the mid height from its floor to
its ceiling is below grade for a minimum of 50% of its perimeter.



Block Face refers to historic contributing buildings on the particular block
face and on the same side of the street as the applicant property; may use
historic non-contributing houses if there are no historic contributing
buildings.



Building Line: The line where the building or structure intersects grade. 
At open walls, the eave line shall be used.



Building Parts - Main Portion refers to the central building mass.



   ∙   Front Portion:  The front section of the building; extends
back one room, or ten feet from the front wall.



   ∙   Wings refers to a subsidiary and extension portion of the
building; at least one room in size.



   ∙   Bay refers to a room projection. It may extend to grade, the
floor level or may be raised.  It may have its own roof.



Historic Buildings:  Means historic contributing buildings unless noted
otherwise.



Oblique, Non-Orthogonal, Skewed Front Walls: Front walls that are not
parallel or at a 90 degree angle to their side walls. 



Primary Building Side: The most architecturally significant side, typically
the front and the side that faces the street, and that typically has the main
entry



Secondary Building Side(s): Non primary side(s).



Visible Sides or Portions: Portions of the building visible from the adjacent
street(s) or public way.



For other building terms see the Appendix of the Design Review Handbook.



 



BUILDING AND ADDITION PLACEMENT



Intent:  Maintain the open space and block defining qualities of the
historic districts.



The Building and Addition Placement section includes the following guidelines:



   ∙    Orientation



   ∙    Spacing



   ∙    Setbacks



 



 



BUILDING AND ADDITION PLACEMENT



Guideline: Preserve the historic open space qualities, setbacks and building
orientation determined by the historic buildings of the district.



Description: Although there is not a uniform setback or spacing of houses in
Forest Grove’s historic districts, buildings are usually set back from the
street on the lot with a relatively sizable front yard, which includes a wide
parkway between street and sidewalk. Buildings in a residential district are
generally located on lots so that open space exists between them. Lot widths
and building widths vary, but there is generally a repetitive pattern of
buildings and open space created by side yards and driveways between
buildings. 



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 
 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    Orientation:  Locate and position new buildings similar to the
historic buildings on the block face.



∙    Orient the building front towards the street. Building entries
should be at the front of the building facing and accessing the street.



∙    Position additions at the rear of the building, if possible. 
Occasionally a side ell may be an appropriate addition.  New structures and
additions are not recommended on the front façade.



∙    Moving or repositioning a historic building or structure may affect
its historic significance and needs to be reviewed carefully.



∙    Spacing: Maintain the pattern of buildings set apart by open spaces
between them as established historically in the district and block face.



∙    Removal of non-historic additions is encouraged, as is
reconstruction of missing historic features and additions with proper
documentation.



∙    Maintain public parking strips, sidewalks, and street trees as
appropriate for the block face.



Setbacks: Maintain consistency in the historic pattern of setbacks and
building spacing throughout each block.  Front setbacks should be yards,
perhaps with driveways along the sides of the buildings.



∙    New construction setbacks for all buildings should match those of
the surrounding historic buildings. 



∙    The front setback should be a yard, not a parking area. 




 


 
Related Code Standards


∙    Orientation: Locate the primary building side and entry of the
building to face the public way.  This side is typically parallel to the
street. Maintain a similar orientation of the neighboring historic buildings.



∙    Additions are not allowed onto the primary side of a historic
building.



∙    New structures or additions are not allowed in the front yard.



∙    Existing historic buildings or structures may not be moved or
repositioned without Guideline review. See §17.5.225.



∙    Spacing: Maintain the existing front and side spacing and building
placement determined by historic buildings within the block face.



∙    Removal of non-historic features or reconstruction of historic
features, with documentation, is allowed on historic buildings. See
§17.5.220(i)(vi).



∙    Maintain parkways and sidewalk alignment for the block face. See
§17.8.620.



∙    Setbacks: Maintain and preserve the front yard setback as
determined by historic buildings within the block face.  Existing
non-complying historic as well as non-historic structures may remain and may
be repaired but not enlarged.



∙    Maintain average side yard setbacks as determined by historic
buildings on the block face. 



∙    Accessory Dwelling Units [ADU]:  Either attached or detached: the
side yard is governed by §17.3.130 Table 3-7.










 



 



 




 
 



Typical Spacing and Setback Found in the Districts
 
 
New construction set back or brought forward from the
street in ways that cause misalignment disrupts the
rhythm of the historic development pattern. New
construction that maintains the existing setbacks fits
better into the historic streetscape.

Building Design



Intent: The intent of the Building Design Guidelines section is to preserve
the unique historic contributing qualities of the historic districts. For
existing historic buildings, the particular interest is to provide direction
for sustaining those resources as they require maintenance, and alterations.
The intent for non-historic buildings and new development is to provide
guidance for the design of their new construction and alterations such that
the end result does not deter or diminish the overall historic qualities of
the historic districts.



A compatible new building or addition should complement the existing pattern
of the historic district. This involves designing buildings that use an
architectural style that is similar to its neighbors. Historical photographs
can help in this regard. Occasionally, a property owner wishes to increase
the living space within an existing building. In fact, a number of historic
buildings in Forest Grove have had additions constructed.



The Building Design section includes the following guidelines:



   ∙    Height



   ∙    Width



   ∙    Shape



   ∙    Roofs, Dormers and Roof Features



   ∙    Porches



   ∙    Front, Side and Rear Elevations



   ∙    Outbuildings and Garages



   ∙    Exterior Siding and Decorative Architectural Details



   ∙    Doors and Windows



   ∙    Foundations



 



 



BUILDING SIZE, SCALE AND COMPATIBILITY



Guideline: The existing historic buildings sizes, scale and shapes in the
district should be evaluated and respected when considering modifications,
additions, or when constructing new buildings.



Description: Buildings in the historic districts are generally one,
one-and-a-half, or two stories in height, as are the churches and Central
School. 



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    Maintain elements that define the existing size, scale,
relationship to the ground and site, shape, and architectural styles of
historic buildings in the district.



∙    Additional floors are generally not appropriate.  Attempt to gain
additional floor space through the use of additions to the rear or side of
the building, or by the addition of appropriate dormers on the roof to create
additional space on the attic level.



∙    The size and scale of new buildings should be consistent with
surrounding buildings in the district.



∙    Any additions should be compatible with the original building
design and architectural style.



∙    Except in limited locations, very large buildings (such as mansions
or large apartment complexes) are inappropriate in the district. Larger
buildings should generally be located at corners, and smaller buildings
should generally be located in the mid-block.



∙    No addition should overwhelm the scale of the building.



∙    The additional space should be compatible in design, but
distinguishable from, the original building. Compatible materials and
construction techniques should be used.



∙    Additions should be made so that if the addition ever were to be
removed, there is minimal damage to the original structure.



∙    The site shall not be significantly re-graded or altered for the
purpose of gaining additional stories or building size.

Related Code Standards


Height



∙    Height Limit at Eave or Parapet:  The height from grade at the
building line to the predominant roof eave that exists for historic buildings
on the block face up to a maximum of 25 feet.  Historic non-contributing
buildings may be used if there are no historic contributing buildings on the
block face.



∙    Height Limit at Ridge: The height from grade at the building line
to the main roof ridge that exists for historic buildings on the block face
up to 10 feet above the allowable eave height.



∙    The maximum number of above grade stories is 2½.



∙    The height or number of stories of the front portion of historic
buildings may not be increased.



∙    Historic buildings may be raised no more than 3 feet from their
existing height.



∙    The maximum height from grade at the building line to the main
level for new buildings is 4 feet.



∙    Basements are allowed for all buildings. The site may not be
substantially re-graded for basement use.



Width



∙    The width of a new building front may not vary more or less than
20% from the range that exists for historic buildings on the block.



∙    The front width of historic buildings may not be increased more
than 10%.



Shape



∙    The overall primary building shape and that of additions must be
representative of existing historic buildings on the block face.



∙    Additions to historic buildings shall be designed to be secondary
to the main building.



∙    Oblique, skewed and non-orthogonal front walls are not allowed on
the primary building.



∙    Rounded walls or porches are allowed for secondary walls or
additions.

ROOFS, DORMERS AND ROOF FEATURES



Guideline: Preserve and respect the original roof shape and characteristics
of historic buildings.



Description: Utilize the existing roof shapes and qualities of the historic
buildings as a guide for alterations and new work.  Roof forms vary in shape
and pitch. Most are of moderate pitch, although there are examples of steeply
pitched and shallow roofs. The majority of roofs are gabled or hipped,
although there are also examples of gambrel roofs and clipped gable (or
jerkinhead) roofs.



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    The repair and alteration of roofs should match the original shape
and pitch.  Generally, the same roof pitch should be used for additions.



∙    The same roof type and material should be used for additions.



∙    The roof form of new buildings should be compatible with that of
neighborhood buildings.



∙    Distinctive decorative features, such as dormers, character
defining chimneys, and exposed rafter tails, should be retained. New dormers
generally should have the same character as the existing roof (for example a
gabled dormer on a gabled roof) and should be designed in proportion to the
roof area and other windows in the house.



∙    Dormers that did not exist historically should be kept to the rear
of the house and out of view from the public right-of-way whenever possible.



∙    Do not install roof features that never existed or that create a
false historical appearance.  This may include cupolas, cresting, or ornate
and corbelled chimneys.  Skylights, roof vents, new chimneys and flues,
mechanical systems and roof decks should be as inconspicuous as possible from
the public right-of-way.



∙    Restoration of missing historic features with proper documentation
is encouraged.



∙    When feasible, roof materials should be repaired or replaced in
kind. Match the original patterns, textures and materials when possible. 
When repair or replacement of an original material is not possible, the use
of composition shingles is acceptable.



∙    Inappropriate roofing materials include metal, tile, concrete, and
vinyl. These materials should be avoided unless there is clear evidence that
they were used when the building was constructed.


 
 
Related Code Standards


Roofs



∙    Roof forms for the main structure, additions and wings where
visible are to be gabled or hipped.  Shed roofs are not allowed for the main
building portion.  Parapets and non-visible roofs are not allowed for the
main roof unless represented by historic buildings on the block. 



∙    Roof shape shall be consistent with other historic buildings on the
block in style, configuration and pitch.



∙    Roofs shall have a minimum of 12” overhang or the average of
historic buildings on the block face.



∙    Gable roofs shall have matching roof slopes.



∙    Porches or bays may have lower sloped roofs than that of the main
roof.  These roofs may be gabled, hipped, shed or more complex.



∙    Shallow stepped gable roofs: a maximum of 2 are allowed.



∙    The roof shape and slope of the main portion on historic buildings
as visible shall not be changed.



∙    Roofing types Not Allowed where visible:  Sheet metal, clay,
concrete or metal tile, single ply types. 



∙    Gutters and Downspouts: 



       Types allowed:  painted sheet metal, copper.



       Types not allowed: vinyl, plastic except as a downspout receiver
hub visible for a maximum of 12” above grade.

Dormers and Roof Features


∙    Dormers on all buildings are to match the existing building style,
shape and relative proportion.  Dormers shall intersect the main roof below
the main ridge.



∙    New dormers are not allowed on a front sloping roof of historic
buildings.



∙    A maximum of 2 dormers are allowed on the front of new buildings.



∙    The total area for all dormers on a particular slope is limited to
33% for gable roofed dormers and 50% for shed roofed dormers.



∙    New decorative roof feature additions such as cupolas, towers,
crestings, railings are not allowed.



∙    Chimneys on historic buildings:  Retain and repair above the
roofline.



∙    Skylights are not allowed on the front sloping roof. 



∙    Solar panels, satellite dishes, mechanical equipment, are not
allowed on the roof or walls of the front building portion.  This includes
the front and sides extending back 10 feet.

PORCHES



Guideline: Preserve the front porch and entry of historic buildings. Utilize
those existing historic front porches as a design clue for new construction. 



Description: A front porch is a characteristic feature of many historic
homes, serving as the transition from the street to the interior of the
house, and providing outdoor living space as well as protection from the
weather. The front porch designates the front and primary entry for the house.



 








 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    Avoid removing original porches and their distinctive features,
such as posts, railings, and stairs; or replacing them with incompatible
porches that destroy or cover up character-defining features of the house. 



∙    Repair porch elements whenever possible. If repair is not possible,
replacement of materials should be in kind and original design and details
should be retained. 



∙    Porches should not be enclosed unless the railings, detail, and
open quality of the porch are carefully preserved.



∙    When trying to replicate a historic porch that has been removed,
base the replacement design on historic photographs and historical research
and documentation. If no photographs or written descriptive evidence are
available, use a period design that is suitable for the style of
architecture, replicating trim details and siding materials of the house. 



∙    Porch repairs and replacements should conform to current building
codes related to railing height, spindle spacing, step spacing, etc.



∙    The use of porches should be compatible with that of surrounding
historic buildings, and consistent with the building's architecture.  If the
nearby houses have porches, consider designing the new building with a porch
that is compatible in style and scale, or if the nearby houses are of a
vintage where porches were not included, the new building should be designed
without a front porch, or with one that is modest and does not draw attention
to itself or defines the main entry otherwise.



∙    Porches on new buildings shall respect the style, character of
existing historic buildings on the block face.  Upper level porches may be
allowed if represented on the block face. 



∙   New porches, stairs and components shall integrate with and match
the style, materials and finishes of the building.

 
Related Code Standards


∙    New porches shall comply with the above requirements for spacing,
setback, building form, shape, and roofs.



∙    New front porches must have front street access.



∙    New porches on all buildings are to match the existing building
style, shape and proportion.



∙    Porches on historic buildings shall not be removed or relocated.



∙    New houses and accessory dwelling units [ADUs] shall incorporate a
porch or architecturally defined entry for each main level unit unless
sharing an existing porch or entry.  The minimum porch dimensions are four
feet by four feet and sixteen square feet per dwelling unit.



∙    Porches shall have roofs and are to be integrated with the building
and finished accordingly.  They shall be consistent with the main building's
style.



∙    Front porches and roofs shall serve the main level and be one story
in height.



∙    Raised front and visible side porches require finished enclosures
or skirting below their walk structure consistent with the main building
style.



∙    Front porches on historic buildings may not be enclosed.



∙    Side porches serving the main or basement level are allowable. 
They are to be secondary but consistent in style and detail with the front
porch.



∙    Porches above the main level on the front of the building are not
allowed unless existing elsewhere on historic buildings on the block face.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN FRONT, SIDE AND REAR ELEVATIONS



Guideline: Preserve the defining qualities the front elevation with minimal
alterations. 



Description: The front elevations of buildings in the historic districts are
generally considered the main facades. They are sometimes distinguished from
the side and rear elevations by the use of more elaborate architectural
detail and ornamentation. 



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙   Maintain the front facade orientation to the street or corner unless
historic orientation was different.



∙   Original features of each elevation (such as porches, balconies, bay
windows, and trim details) should be retained and rehabilitated.



∙   Additions to buildings should be located on the rear and side
elevations. Note: The Front Portion includes the first ten feet of the sides.



∙   Additions and alterations on historic buildings shall be
historically appropriate and consistent and shall use representative products
and materials.



∙   The design of new buildings or alterations to non-historic or
historic non-contributing buildings shall not worsen the integrity of the
block face or historic district.



∙   Avoid creating a false historical appearance that is incompatible
with the style of the building. Rehabilitation should be based on sound
pictorial or documented evidence.


 





 
Related Code Standards


∙   The front façade orientation and access for historic buildings
shall be maintained.  The major defining features including entry, porches,
roofline, bays and dormers shall be retained on the front and visible sides
of historically contributing buildings.



∙   The front façade orientation and access for new buildings shall be
consistent with historic building examples on the block.



∙   Front Façade:  New buildings shall avoid very flat, wide and tall
front and visible side walls with minimal relief and level parapets.  The
front shall create relief by a limited use of projections and recesses such
as a porch, bay, wing, or the roof slope. 



∙   Openings: New buildings shall have windows on the front and visible
sides of habitable spaces at each level.  Each such space shall have a
minimum of one window.



∙   Rear Elevation: Unless specifically noted as significant, the rear
and not visible side elevations of historic buildings may be altered. Those
alterations must be consistent with the overall building design and use
products and materials noted as acceptable in the Standards.


 

 



 



 



OUTBUILDINGS AND GARAGES



Guideline: Garages and outbuildings are important, but secondary, structures
for the historic building.



Description: Garages and outbuildings should not be overlooked as important
components of historic properties. There are a number of historic garages in
Forest Grove. Alterations or additions to these buildings should follow these
guidelines.



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    Whenever possible, original garages or out-buildings should be
retained or restored, and maintained rather than replaced.



∙    Whenever possible, retain and repair historic materials, or replace
them in kind.



∙    If replacing a historic garage, use photographic documentation to
guide the design for the replacement. Early garages were often designed to
match the house; replacement of such garages should take such design and
materials usage into account.



∙    If constructing a new garage for a historic property, the size and
scale of the garage should be compatible with the historic house for which it
is being constructed. The shape and pitch of the garage roof and siding
materials should match that of the house. 



∙    The key element in garage design is the door. Repair original
garage doors whenever possible. If replacement is necessary, avoid overhead
roll doors (unless the garage is recent enough to have an overhead roll door
originally). Consider using typical early garage doors, which are often
side-hinged, paneled bi-folds with the top third glazed. It is possible to
construct side-hinged, bi-fold doors that can be activated with a garage door
opener.



∙    Houses built after World War II might have had a carport rather
than a garage. As with garages, these should be designed to be compatible
with the historic house.


 
Related Code Standards


∙    New garages and accessory buildings shall be historically
consistent with the primary building in style, size, materials, and roof.



∙    Replacement garages:  Retain and repair over replacement for both
structure and materials. 



∙    Location and Orientation:  Where an alley exists, locate the
garage for alley access.  Garages and outbuildings shall be located in the
rear where possible.  Garages may be located in the side yard or may be
attached if recessed behind the primary building face by a minimum of six
feet and if meeting the side yard setback and spacing requirements.



∙    Garage Doors: Total width is limited to ? of the primary building
face width if facing a street.  Height is limited to eight feet. 
Construction, style and materials shall be consistent with the main
building.  A maximum of one double garage door or two single doors facing
the street is allowed per 50 feet of lot width.  No width constraint if
facing the alley.



∙    Carports and Breezeways: Carports are allowed where consistent with
the building style and age. Breezeways may be used for connection to garages,
carports or out-buildings. Design of these structures must be consistent with
the primary building in style, size, construction, materials, detail and
color.



∙    Gazebos and Pergolas are not allowed on the front or in the front
yard. See §17.7.020.



∙    Materials and Types Not Allowed: Flush, open grate-mesh, and mostly
glass garage doors.

EXTERIOR SIDING AND DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS



Guideline: Preserve and maintain historic siding and decorative architectural
details and utilize new matching materials for repairs and additions.



Description: Wood was the predominant building material used for historic
properties. It was abundant, cheap, and easily worked to produce siding,
moldings, decorative features and finishes. Other materials that were
occasionally used include brick, concrete, stone, and stucco.  It is
important to identify and protect character-defining features such as siding
types, window and door moldings, cornices, and brackets.



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    Whenever possible, original siding and details should be retained
or restored, and maintained rather than replaced. If replacing siding
materials is necessary, match the siding type, material, and reveal as
closely as possible. Do not substitute one type of siding for another (for
example, do not use heavy shakes to replace wood shingles; do not use
flush-mounted shiplap to replace clapboards; use consistently-sized reveals).



∙    Siding materials used on new buildings should be consistent with
the predominant materials used on other buildings in the district. It is
preferable to use wood siding; vinyl and aluminum sidings are not encouraged
in historic neighborhoods. 



∙    Use decorative detailing responsibly and locate it at the eaves,
windows, and door heads, and porches. Do not attempt to create a false
historic appearance.



∙    Avoid using destructive surface preparation such as propane or
butane torches, sandblasting, and high pressure water blasting, as these
methods can damage the siding and trim materials.



∙    Observe current laws for lead-based paint removal.



∙    Inappropriate materials include T1-11 or scored plywood, vinyl,
plastic, and metal. If replacement of moldings and decorative features is
necessary, match the materials, details, and workmanship as closely as
possible.

 
Related Code Standards


∙    Historic buildings shall retain and repair existing siding,
architectural features, and details.



∙    Replacement siding, moldings, and other decorative architectural
details shall match the material, pattern, detail and dimension of either
existing or original.



∙    Front and visible sides of new buildings shall have the following
minimum wall trim: window and door casings, top of wall to roof overhang on
gable sides.



∙    Siding Patterns Allowed:  A maximum of 3 wood siding or shingle
patterns and types, may also have 1 type of masonry or plaster.



∙    Surface Preparation:  Coating preparation shall avoid damage to
historic materials.  Sandblasting masonry or wood is not allowed.  Note:
Pressure washing can damage mater-ials if performed with high pressure,
narrow water tip, or insufficient spray distance.



∙    Siding, decorative architectural details and exposed materials that
are not allowed: 


    Aluminum or metal; vinyl; scored plywood or sheet siding;

    Alternative engineered siding not matching original profiles;

    Plastic, foam or polymer trim,

    Cultured stone, synthetic masonry.


∙    Finishes: 


    Use of stains and clear finishes is acceptable only for doors and
sidelights, and utility structures.


    Mill or clear finish aluminum or stainless steel is not allowed as an
exposed finish.

DOORS AND WINDOWS



Guideline:  Preserve and maintain historic doors and windows, and utilize
their design as a cue for new work.



Description: Windows and doors provide access, light, and ventilation. Their
design and arrangement is often a primary decorative feature in a historic
building. The majority of historic windows in Forest Grove are double-hung
wood sash, although there are examples of several other styles of windows.
Historically, doors were also made of wood.



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    Original window and door openings should be retained.



∙    Original decorative details should be preserved.



∙    Repair wooden doors, windows, sashes, frames, and trim whenever
possible. If repair is not possible, replacements should match the original
details in design, configuration, and materials (i.e., wood, glass, and
hardware).



∙    Avoid removing a historic window and blocking the opening or
replacing it with a new window that conveys a completely different
appearance. 



∙    If storm windows are desired, consider those that can be installed
on the interior of the windows. If exterior storms are necessary, select
storm window materials compatible with the age of the house (wooden storm
windows are appropriate for homes constructed prior to 1945, while aluminum
storm windows became popular for homes constructed after 1945).



∙    Window restorations should follow fire safety and building codes.



∙    New windows added in basement and attic remodels must meet building
codes related to adequate egress and ingress while attempting to retain
historical accuracy; but building codes take precedence.



∙    The relationship of width to height of windows and doors should be
consistent with the dominant pattern set by the surrounding historic
buildings, as should the rhythm of walls to openings. 

 

Related Code Standards



∙    Original openings on visible sides of historic buildings shall be
retained.



∙    New main and upper level window or door openings on front or
visible sides of historic buildings are not allowed.



∙    New basement windows or doors are allowed on side walls.



∙    Retain and repair existing historic window and door parts and trim
if possible.  Wholesale replacement of windows or sash of otherwise windows
in good condition on historic buildings is not allowed.



∙    New or replacement windows and doors on historic buildings shall
match the style, configuration, dimensions, and materials of existing or
originals. 



∙    Storm windows are acceptable on interior or exterior.  At the
exterior they shall match the window shape, style, basic configuration, and
shall be a comparable color.  Storm doors are allowed.



∙    Windows and doors on new buildings shall be appropriate to the
style of the building and as found on historic buildings on the block face. 
This includes their design, materials, pattern, grouping, and
configuration.  Not allowed: Vertically asymmetric, individual window
division or configuration.



∙    New window types and materials not allowed:  At front facing or
visible sides: Sliding glass units, glass block, vinyl, fiber glass, between
glass grids, commercial type windows. 



∙    Glazing on visible building sides and front shall be clear.
Reflective or tinted glass or films are not allowed; decorative or stained
glass replacement is excepted.  Obscure glass is allowed at bathrooms. 



∙    Doors and Sidelights: New decorative or stained glass is allowed.



∙    New door types not allowed: Flush metal doors, metal and glass
storefront or commercial type doors.

FOUNDATIONS



Guideline: Maintain the exterior visible quality of historic foundations
while ensuring their structural integrity.



Description: The majority of foundations are concrete, either poured
reinforced structural concrete or concrete block. There are a small number of
examples where the foundations include brick and/or stone. 



 



 



 


Track 2  Design Guidelines

 
 

Track 1  Development Standards



Recommended


∙    When possible, the appearance of the original foundation should be
retained.  Changes to foundations should match or be compatible with
original foundations in height and use of materials. 



∙    Porch steps, access doors and windows, and vents are features that
may be considered part of a foundation. Care should be taken to retain these
features when repairing or replacing foundations.



∙    If a foundation is replaced, attempt to create the same look on the
exterior surface.



∙    Foundation work is generally dangerous and should be done by a
professional.



∙    New or repaired foundations should be designed by a professional
and should consider drainage, earthquake anchors, all required safety
features, and insulation.



∙    Foundations should be constructed of concrete and according to
building code.




 
 
Related Code Standards


∙    On historic buildings: Repairs and replacements to match original
foundation appearance, materials and height at visible faces.



∙    Retain or repair existing porch and entry steps, and foundation
openings including windows, doors, and vents on historic buildings.



∙    New or replaced foundations and footings shall meet current
structural and seismic requirements.



∙    Original solid masonry foundations may have non visible concrete or
metal support.



∙    New foundations at original solid masonry may have a matching
veneer over structural concrete, concrete block unit [CMU], or steel.



∙    Visible foundations at new infill buildings to match the range of
visible heights of historic buildings on the block face and may be concrete
block units or concrete.



∙    Below grade or otherwise hidden foundations, piers and footings may
be concrete or other materials.

Notes

1 

The term, vernacular architecture, refers to buildings made by common, local
builders in an informal way, rather than by architects using design
methodologies. During construction, locally available resources and
traditions are used to address local needs and circumstances. Vernacular
architecture tends to evolve over time to reflect the environmental,
cultural, and historical context in which it exists.
