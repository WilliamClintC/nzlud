A. Authority: Police officers are hereby authorized to give notice to persons violating provisions of this title by
delivering citation tags to violators or, in cases where vehicles without drivers are parked or stopped in
violation of this title, by affixing such tags to the vehicles by means of which the violation occurred. Such
citation tags, among other things, shall indicate briefly the charge, shall bear the registration number of the
vehicle, and shall direct the violator to present the tag at the police station or other designated place within
five (5) days, or such other reasonable time as may be specified thereon. Nothing in this section shall
abridge the power to arrest any violator and to take him into custody, or to file a complaint against him, at
any time.

furnished by the city clerk and that such tags be serially numbered, and may regulate the use and handling
of citation tags. (2001 Code § 70.090)
70.091: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CITATION TAG:
If a violator of any provision of this title who has been given a citation tag as provided above, fails to appear in

of the vehicle involved a letter or other written notice informing him of the violation and warning him to appear
as directed and that, in the event such letter or notice is disregarded for a period of five (5) days, a complaint

vehicle, proof that the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of any such law
or regulation, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was at the time of such parking
the registered owner of such vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the
registered owner of such vehicle was the person who parked or placed such vehicle at the point where,
and for the time during which, such violation occurred.
B. The foregoing stated presumption shall apply only when the procedure of giving a citation tag has been
followed. (2001 Code § 70.092)

Chapter 98
ALARMS
98.01: TITLE:
This chapter may be cited as the ALARM ORDINANCE. (Ord. 1624, 11-2-2015)
98.02: PURPOSE AND EXCLUSIONS:
A. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage alarm users to assume increased responsibility for maintaining
the mechanical reliability and the proper use of alarm systems, to prevent unnecessary police and fire
response to false alarms and to protect the emergency response capability of the city. By coming to the
understanding that, other than actual criminal activity or a fire emergency, there is no valid reason for an
alarm to activate, the police and firefighters can better target responses to actual emergencies.
B. This chapter draws a distinction between responses to requests by individual persons and responses to
requests made by mechanical devices. It is the policy of the police and fire departments to respond to valid
requests for service. Nothing in this chapter lessens or increases that responsibility. It is also understood
that many requests for service to mechanical activations are not valid calls for service and the resident
does not want the police or firefighters to respond.
C. The reduction of false alarms will significantly improve the effectiveness of the police and fire department
responders.
D. No provision within this chapter shall be construed as to apply to any building, structure or facility owned,
controlled or occupied by the United States Of America, the state, or any county or city of this state. (Ord.
1624, 11-2-2015)
98.03: DEFINITIONS:
Terms, which are not defined in this chapter, shall have their ordinarily accepted meanings or such as the
context may apply. For the purpose of this chapter, each of the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings given below:
ALARM DISPATCH REQUEST: A notification to the police or fire personnel of the city from an alarm industry
business that an alarm system has been activated.
ALARM INDUSTRY BUSINESS: Any entity having obtained a license pursuant to the provisions of the alarm
industry act of the state who sells, leases, maintains, services, repairs, alters, replaces, moves, installs or
monitors any alarm system.

alarm dispatch request.
ALARM SITE: A single premises or location served by an alarm system.

ALARM SYSTEM: Any mechanism, equipment or device which is designed to detect the presence of a fire, or
an unauthorized entry or activity in any building or on any property, or to direct attention to a fire, robbery,
burglary, or other emergency in progress, and to signal the above occurrences either by a local or audible
alarm or by a silent or remote alarm, directly or indirectly to the police or fire department. The following devices
shall not constitute alarm systems within the meaning of this chapter:
A. Devices which do not activate alarms that are audible, visible, or perceptible outside the protected
premises;

directly or by third party, to the police or fire department;

alarm or his employees or agents, or which otherwise elicits a response by a law enforcement agency or the
fire department when a situation requiring such response does not in fact exist. A false alarm shall also mean
the activation of an alarm, the purpose of which is to communicate or indicate a specific emergency situation,
when in fact that specific emergency situation does not exist. Such terminology does not include, for example,
alarms activated by utility line mishaps, tornados, earthquakes, or other violent conditions of nature, or other
conditions clearly beyond the control of the alarm manufacturer, installer, owner or user.
FALSE ALARM DISPATCH: An alarm dispatch request when the responding personnel finds no evidence of
criminal activity or fire emergency after having completed an investigation of the location. An alarm dispatch
request that is canceled by the alarm user or the alarm industry business prior to the time an officer or
firefighter reaches the location shall not be considered a false alarm dispatch. Any alarm response that is first
designated as a false alarm dispatch but where the alarm user later shows convincing evidence of criminal
activity or a fire emergency to the investigating personnel and files a police or fire report, shall be subject to the
judgment of the city manager, to be amended to not be recorded as false alarm dispatch.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 281/395
Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose And
Methods
151.01: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state has, in 11 Oklahoma Statutes chapters 41 through 47, as amended, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore,
the city ordains the following, to become effective immediately. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)
151.02: FINDINGS OF FACT:
A. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
B. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an
increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)
151.03: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and
sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)
151.04: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 282/395
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause
excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are
involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)

structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before
"start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage",
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which
are the minimum necessary conditions; or
B. Any alteration of a "historic structure"; provided, that the alteration would not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a "historic structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the city of Woodward city commission to a person from the terms of this

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)
151.12: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and
flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside
the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any official or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)

required:
1. Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and
substantially improved structures; and
2. Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a
result of proposed development.
B. Factors Determining Decision: Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator
shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:
1. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
2. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
3. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
4. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
5. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
6. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance
and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems;
7. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the
effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
8. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
9. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
and
10. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.
C. Development In A, AO, AE Zones: The floodplain administrator or city commission, as applicable, may
approve certain development in zones A, AO or AE delineated on the Woodward County FIRM, which
increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'); provided, that the
applicant for the development permit in that case first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12. (Ord. 1547, 12-
5-2011)
151.16: VARIANCES:
A. General Provisions:
1. The city commission may grant variances for uses which do not satisfy the requirements of the
Oklahoma floodplain management act or this chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate
proof that: a) compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property
without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people; and b) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 290/395
section. However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the
continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
2. Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any person who receives it from any liability
imposed by the Oklahoma floodplain management act or by other laws of the state.
3. In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than twenty (20) years.
4. Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the city commission, accompanied by a filing fee
of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
5. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of
one-half (1/2) acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 151.15B of this
chapter and provisions of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
6. Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation will be issued a notice
signed by the chairperson of the city commission which states that: a) the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the
base flood elevation; and b) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property.
7. At such time as the city commission deems the petition ready for notification to the public, the city
commission shall schedule a hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation in Woodward County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
8. The city commission shall conduct the hearing and make determinations in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this section. This appeals group shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the
equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when
determining whether the variance shall be granted.
9. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and
d. A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
10. Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the intent of this chapter, the city
commission may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further
the purposes and objectives stated in section 151.03 of this chapter.
11. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance; and a copy of any variance issued by the city commission shall be sent by the floodplain
administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of the variance.
B. Special Provisions:
1. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the
national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the
procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 291/395
2. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
3. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
4. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development
necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that:
a. The criteria of subsections A5, A9, B2 and B3 of this section are met;
b. The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the
base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)

Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 151.07 of this chapter, are areas
designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to
three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the
following provisions apply:
A. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated at or above the base flood elevation (the depth number specified in feet on
the community FIRM or at least 2 feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified).
B. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated at or above the base flood elevation (the depth number specified in feet on

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 294/395
1. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy.
2. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator
that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection B1 of this section are satisfied.
3. Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)
151.21: FLOODWAYS:
The following provisions shall apply to floodways:
A. Encroachments, including, but not limited to, fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development are prohibited within the adopted floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
C. The city may permit encroachments within the adopted floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations; provided, that the applicant for the development permit complies with all of 44 CFR
section 65.12. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)
151.22: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, clause, sentence or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
chapter. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development
without the elevation certificate or other certifications required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation
until such time as that documentation is provided. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to
comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than two hundred dollars
($200.00) for each violation and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day
on which the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent the city commission or its city attorney from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation. (Ord. 1547, 12-5-2011)

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
General Provisions
153.01: PURPOSE:
A. The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban development. The arrangement of land
parcels in the community for residential, commercial and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools,
parks and other public purposes, will determine, to a large degree, the conditions of health, safety,
economy and amenity that prevail in the urban area. The quality of these conditions is of public interest.
These regulations and standards for the subdivision and improvement of land for urban use are to make
provision for adequate light, air, open spaces, drainage, transportation, public utilities and other needs, to
ensure the development and maintenance of a healthy, attractive and efficient community that provides for
the conservation and protection of its human and natural resources.

relating to design or to other provisions of these regulations. (2001 Code § 153.05)
Design Standards
153.15: URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
A. Quality: The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of design of the individual
subdivisions that compose it. Good community design requires the coordination of the efforts of each
subdivider and developer of land within the urban area.
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 315/395
B. General Principles: Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the
principles established by the general plan for land use, circulation, community facilities and public utility
services, and in accordance with the following general principles:
1. Neighborhood Unit: It is intended that the urban area should be designed as a group of integrated
residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial and industrial and public facilities. The
neighborhood, as a planning unit, is intended as an area principally for residential use, and of a size that
can be served by one elementary school. Space for religious, recreational, educational and shopping
facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be provided and designed as an integral part
of each neighborhood.
2. Size Of Lots And Blocks: The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential, commercial,
industrial and public uses should be designed to provide adequate light, air, open space, landscaping
and off street parking and loading facilities.
3. Natural Features: The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be designed to make
the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical features. Tree masses and large
individual trees should be preserved. The system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should
be designed to take advantage of the visual qualities of the area.
4. Design For Circulation: Circulation within the urban area shall be provided in accordance with the
following design criteria:
a. Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all arterial streets and highways as shown on the
major street plan. Arterial streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood.
b. Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel of land within the residential
neighborhood and within industrial areas, and in a manner that will discourage use by through traffic.
They should be planned so that future urban expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets
to arterial routes.
c. Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from other minor streets to the major
street system.
d. Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided only on minor streets.
e. Pedestrianways should be separated from roadways used by vehicular traffic. Sidewalks should be
designed to provide all residential building sites with direct access to all neighborhood facilities,
including the elementary school, parks and playgrounds, churches and shopping centers.
5. Minimum Standards And General Policies: Minimum standards for development are contained in the
zoning ordinance, the building code and these regulations. However, the general plan expresses policies
which are intended to achieve optimum quality of urban development. If only the minimum standards are
followed, as expressed by the various regulations affecting land development, a standardization of
development will occur. This will produce a monotonous urban setting. Subdivision design should be of a
quality to carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the general plan and in these
regulations, rather than be limited to the minimum standards required herein. (2001 Code § 153.15)
153.16: STREETS:
A. Definitions; Street Classification: For the purpose of providing for the development of the streets, highways,
roads and rights of way in the city, and for their future improvement, reconstruction, realignment and
necessary widening (including provision for curbs and sidewalks), each existing street, highway, road and
right of way has been designated in the city general plan and classified therein. The classification of each
street, highway, road and right of way is based upon its location in the respective zoning districts of the city,
its present and estimated future traffic volume and its relative importance and function, as specified in the
city general plan. The required street and sign improvements shall be measured as set forth for each
classification in the adopted subdivision regulations and/or the city general plan.
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 316/395

the exception to the installation from standard street. Any type of development shall be discouraged until
adequate roads and utilities have been provided. It shall have a minimum fifty foot (50') easement,
landscaped drainage ditches and an all weather surface (gravel or crushed rock). This street shall not be
dedicated to the city for maintenance and repair. Maintenance and repair shall be the responsibility of
property owners with property abutting the private street. See the street design standards (section 153.39,
table 1 of this chapter) for additional details and requirements.
PRIVATE STREET: This is a street which has not been dedicated to the city for public use, but shall always
be open to police, fire and other officials. The street shall not be maintained or repaired by the city. Such
maintenance and repair shall be the responsibility of the property owners whose property abuts the street.
Private streets shall be constructed to dedicated street standards. Private streets may install privacy gates
which allow limited access to said private street, providing compliance with all applicable ordinances.
B. General Design Principles And Standards:
1. The design of each new subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the principles established by
the general plan for the city and with the minimum standards of these and other regulations.
2. The arrangement of lots, blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most
advantageous use of topography and natural physical features. The system of sidewalks, roadways and
the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of the visual qualities of the area.
C. General Provisions:
1. Frontage, Access: No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided has frontage on,
and access from, an existing street, which street is:
a. An existing state, county or city roadway; or
b. A street shown upon a plat approved by the metropolitan area planning commission and recorded in
the Woodward County clerk's office. Such street or roadway must be suitably improved as required by
the city subdivision or Oklahoma department of transportation regulations and specifications, or be
secured by a performance bond required under these subdivision regulations, with the width and right
of way required by these subdivision regulations.
2. Improvements: Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage, such road shall be
suitably improved as provided herein.
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 317/395
3. Conformance To General Plan: The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to all of the elements of the general plan and be designed in accordance with the
provisions of these and other applicable regulations.
4. Topography: Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local roads shall be curved
wherever possible to provide topographic compatibility. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as
many as possible of the building sites at or above the grades of the streets. A combination of steep
grades and curves shall be avoided.
5. Thoroughfares: All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic generators (such as
industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping centers), to population densities, and to
the pattern of existing proposed land uses.
6. Accessways In Business, Industrial Developments: In business and industrial developments, the streets
and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, the provision of
alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic (including pedestrian).
7. Extend To Boundary Lines: Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be
subdivided (unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions), unless, in the opinion of the
metropolitan area planning commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts.
8. Proposed Future Street System: Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or
intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of the proposed future street system for the
unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
9. Names: No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing
streets. Street names shall be coordinated with 911 emergency system and subject to the approval of the
metropolitan area planning commission and the city commission.
10. Major Streets: Major streets in the subdivision shall be planned to conform with the major street plan
adopted by the city, and provision shall be made for the extension of major and secondary
thoroughfares. Except for courts, places or cul-de-sacs, streets normally shall provide for a reasonable
linkage with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, provide for future
connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest
subdivided tracts, or conform to a neighborhood plan approved or adopted by the metropolitan area
planning commission.
11. Existing Or Proposed Major Streets: Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major street, the metropolitan area planning commission may require service streets, reverse frontage or
deep lots as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation
of through and local traffic. Reverse frontage should have screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line.
12. Minor Streets: Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
13. Limited Access Highways: Limited access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
a. In residential districts, a buffer strip at least twenty five feet (25') in depth, in addition to the normal
setbacks of the lot required in the district, shall be provided adjacent to the limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated as follows on the plat: "This strip is
reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited".
b. In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or
approximately parallel to the limited access highway shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient
distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 318/395
14. Reserve Strips: Reserve strips controlling access to minor streets by parties of persons other than
public agencies shall be prohibited.
15. Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of
the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; and provided, that the
metropolitan area planning commission finds it will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half
of the street easement when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is adjacent to a
tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within the tract which is being
subdivided.
16. Dedication Of Right Of Way: Whenever the major or minor street is located wholly within the proposed
subdivision, the total width of the right of way shall be dedicated; whenever the major or minor street is
located adjacent to the other edge of the subdivision, one-half (1/2) of the right of way shall be dedicated,
if it is determined by the metropolitan area planning commission that it is equitable and feasible from an
engineering and design standpoint for the other half of the right of way to be dedicated from adjacent
property.
17. Street Elevation Within Floodplain: The finished elevation of proposed streets within the designated
floodplain shall be no more than two feet (2') below the level of the 100-year flood.
18. Design Standards Criteria: The criteria established in the street design standards table shall be
followed in the layout and design of all major and minor streets.
19. Privacy Gates: Privacy gates shall only be permitted in areas where private drives or private roadways
are permitted and do not reduce subdivision or street standards. Privacy gates shall not be permitted on
publicly maintained roads.
D. Alignment Of Streets:
1. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent
properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance with the
comprehensive plan.
2. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty feet (150') shall be avoided.
3. A tangent of not less than one hundred feet (100') in length shall be introduced between reverse curves
on major streets and collector streets.
E. Cul-De-Sacs And Dead End Streets:
1. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall normally be one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), including
a turnaround which shall be provided at the closed end, with an inside curb radius of at least forty two
feet (42') and a right of way radius of not less than fifty two feet (52').
2. In the case of temporary dead ended streets which are incomplete but designed to provide future
connection with adjoining unsubdivided areas, proper provisions shall be made for adequate storm
drainage so that stormwater does not collect at the ends of these streets. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead end street temporarily, the right of way and the
improvements shall be extended to the property line. The metropolitan area planning commission may
limit the length of temporary dead end streets in accordance with the design standards of these
regulations.
3. Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by
the metropolitan area planning commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally
not be nearer to such boundary than fifty feet (50'). However, the metropolitan area planning commission
may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
7/9/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=872 319/395
traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead end street.
For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead end
streets shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of these
regulations.
F. Intersections:
1. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right angles and may be curved, if necessary, in order to make
this possible. In no event shall a street intersect any other street at any angle of less than seventy five
degrees (75o).
2. Street corners on local residential streets shall have a minimum radius of twenty feet (20') at the curb
line or its equivalent.
3. Street corners on commercial and industrial streets shall have minimum radius of twenty five feet (25') at
the curb line or its equivalent.
4. Street intersections involving major streets shall have a minimum street corner radius of thirty feet (30')
at the curb line or its equivalent.
5. A twenty five foot (25') area of clear vision at street intersections in subdivisions shall be provided. This
area shall be kept clear of all structures and vegetation exceeding a height of three feet (3') above the
established municipal street elevation. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall
cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right of
way, to the extent deemed necessary to provide adequate and unobstructed vision.
6. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the
approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%)
rate at a distance of sixty feet (60'), measured from the nearest right of way line of the intersecting street.
7. When a class E street intersects a dedicated city street, or a state/county road, the class E street shall
be hard surfaced (asphalt or concrete) in accordance with dedicated street or road standards from the
edge of the road easement to the hard surfaced edge of the street or road. Materials and installation
shall be provided by the owner/owners.
G. Easements:
1. Easements not less than ten feet (10') wide shall be provided along each rear lot line and alongside lot
lines where necessary for use by public and private utilities. Where lots are designed so lots do not abut
at rear lot lines, rear lot easements shall be twenty feet (20'). Proper coordination shall be established
between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the establishment of utility easements in
adjoining properties. The metropolitan area planning commission may require aerial easements and
easements of greater width for the extension of main storm and sanitary sewers and other utilities where
it is deemed necessary.

floodwater in the floodway fringe that will increase flooding in other areas of the floodway or floodway
fringe.
c. When it is determined by the metropolitan area planning commission that the development of the
subdivision will significantly increase runoff, or will otherwise adversely affect stormwater runoff, the
metropolitan area planning commission may require any or all of the following to the extent needed to
reduce the adverse effects of the development:
(1) The existing floodway lying within or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be cleaned to
provide for the free flow of water, and the channel shall be straightened, widened and improved to
the extent required to prevent overflow beyond the limits of the floodway;
(2) Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites and streets to an elevation where
all lots, building areas and streets will not be subject to overflow, and in a manner that will provide
for the rapid runoff of all rainfall; however, such improvements shall be carried out in a manner that
will preserve and protect large trees and attractive physical features of the area;
(3) Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, backsloping, cribbing and other bank
protection shall be designed and constructed to control erosion for all the anticipated conditions of
flow for the segment of channel involved; or
(4) Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with the
specifications of the city at all locations where drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or
alleys.
d. All minor tributary and surface drainage channels located within the subdivision shall be designed to
carry a 100-year maximum flood, shall be designed for self-cleaning and care and maintenance, shall
have sufficient hard surface along the flow line to prevent ponding of water, and shall have design
characteristics of alignment, materials of construction and cross sectioned elements that will be
hydraulically efficient and visually harmonious with the adjacent landscape.
e. Enclosed storm sewers may be required by the city commission where special or unusual conditions
make open channels hazardous or otherwise unfeasible.
f. Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each lot shall flow directly to
a storm sewer, improved channel or paved street without crossing more than two (2) adjacent lots.
g. Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to storm drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent
overflow of six inch (6") high curbs during a 50-year frequency rain for the area and grades involved;
provided, however, that in no case shall the drainage area served by one street exceed twenty (20)
acres, regardless of the amount of flow.
h. Drainage easements of satisfactory width to provide working room for construction and maintenance
shall be provided for all storm sewers. In no case shall the total easement be less than twenty feet
(20').
i. Closed storm sewers shall be constructed of precast or prefabricated pipe or built in place of closed
box design to conform with municipal construction specifications to serve a 100-year frequency rain for
the drainage area involved.
j. Bridges or culverts shall be provided where watercourses cross continuous streets or alleys, shall be
sized to accommodate a 100-year frequency rain (based on the drainage area involved), and shall be
designed in conformance with municipal construction specifications.

k. When subdivision development will result in increased runoff beyond the boundaries of the
subdivision, which cannot be accommodated through channel improvements without causing
downstream flooding, the metropolitan area planning commission may require the construction of one
or more retention reservoirs on the subdivision site at the rate and volume equivalent to the discharge
water from the undeveloped subdivision site. The design shall be for a 100-year frequency flood. Plans
shall be approved by the city engineer. The construction and maintenance of retention reservoirs shall
be the responsibility of the developer.
D. Completion Of Facilities; As Built Drawings:
1. Subsequent to the acceptance of a drainage plan for a subdivision, and prior to the approval of the final
plat or replat of the subdivision, the developer or owner shall complete all detention and drainage
facilities called for in the drainage plan. Upon completion of the designated improvements, the developer
or owner shall submit as built drawings to the city engineer for review and acceptance.
2. The city engineer shall forward the drainage as built drawings to the metropolitan area planning
commission, along with the final plat for approval. Building permits will be issued by the city after the final
plat and all improvement plans have gained acceptance from the city commission.
E. Other Developments: For all new construction and development not defined herein as a "subdivision", the
code enforcement officer may, in his or her discretion, require a drainage plan made in compliance with this
section or other information related to drainage. The code enforcement officer shall approve or disapprove
any such plan or other information received by him or her. (2001 Code § 153.43)

154.030: CH RESIDENTIAL CLUSTER HOUSING:
A. General Description:
1. Cluster housing is designed to encourage a unitary site development plan for dense single-family and
multi-family residential development. The concept of cluster housing involves small minimum lot sizes on
tracts of land developed as single entities for residential purposes. The cluster housing regulations
specifically encourage innovation so that the growing demands for housing may be met by greater
variety in type, design and setting of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land.
The principal use of this district is for cluster housing.
2. The residential cluster housing district is to provide controlled development of closely spaced, residential
buildings with individual design characteristics and appearances, flexibility in design and more variety in
residential development.
3. The residential cluster housing district shall be used to promote development when one of the following
property conditions exist on a portion of that property:

a. Marginal environmental area, i.e., officially designated floodplains, excessive slopes, subsidence
areas and other areas deemed environmentally marginal;
b. Transition area. Where a demonstrated need exists to separate single-family dwellings from
commercial establishments; or
c. Other area. The planning commission may designate and approve other areas as residential cluster
housing districts subject to the final approval of the city council and consistent with good zoning and
planning practices.
4. This district will provide more efficient allocation of parks, recreation areas and open space. In order to
encourage more attractive site planning and building appearances, the controls provided for in the site
plan requirements and subdivision requirements are flexible in nature. All structures within this district
shall meet the minimum firewall regulations set forth in adopted city building and fire codes.
