§104. Community Development Objectives. In addition to the purposes listed in §103, the following specific community development objectives are considered the basis upon which the zone districts and regulations of this Chapter are established.

2. The spread of blight should be halted and older housing upgraded.
3. Vacant or underutilized structures should be recycled for new uses or more fully used.
4. Existing desirable commercial and industrial land uses should be encourage to remain, improve and expand, and new business should be invited to establish in the Borough in appropriate locations.
5. Areas susceptible to flooding and steep slope land should be left undeveloped except for recreational or open space uses.
6. The private and public renewal of the Borough in the future should result in an inviting and compatible residential, commercial and industrial environment.
7. Streets should function to move present and expected traffic volumes as safely and smoothly as possible and new development should not interfere with this objective.

Part 6
Nonconforming Uses
§601. Application. The provisions of this Part shall apply to buildings, structures, signs, lands and uses which were legal prior to adoption of this Chapter but which would not be permitted as the result of the application of this Chapter to their location or use in the Borough, or as a result of the reclassification of the property containing them, or of the adoption of other amendments to this Chapter after the initial passage. This Part is concerned with properties of inadequate area and/or frontage, uses of land and/or structures for activities not permitted in the zone districts where such land and/or structures are located and structures placed on a property too close to property boundary lines or too high for compliance with standards of the zone district in which they are located.
(Ordinance 1076, October 18, 1984, Article VI, §6.1)
§602. Nonconforming Lots of Record. Any property in separate ownership legally recorded in the Beaver County Recorder of Deeds Office prior to enactment of this Chapter and abutting properties in a different ownership may be developed for any use permitted in the zone district where such property is located regardless of the property area, width or shape, except that if the proposed development includes a reduction of minimum yard widths or required parking or loading areas, a variance shall be obtained from the Zoning Hearing Board before development may commence. Properties of inadequate size or frontage shall be developed for no more than one (1) dwelling unit in zone districts where dwellings are permitted.
(Ordinance 1076, October 18, 1984, Article VI, §6.2)
§603. Nonconforming Uses of Lands and Structures.
603.1 Where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter lawful use of land, or land and the structure or structures on it, exists and is made no longer permissible under the requirements of this Chapter, as adopted or amended, such use may be continued indefinitely, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided the following conditions are applied.
603.2 No such nonconforming use of land shall be extended by acquisition of additional land to occupy a greater land area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, nor shall such nonconforming use be expanded to occupy an area on the lot larger than was occupied at the date of adoption of this Chapter, or adoption of an amendment that made the use nonconforming.
603.3 No structure containing a nonconforming use but capable of being enlarged without violating setback or height requirements in the zone district where it is located may be increased in volume over the volume of such structure at the time of adoption of this Chapter or subsequent amendments that made the use nonconforming. A nonconforming use which occupies part of a structure may be extended throughout the structure it occupied at the time of adoption of this Chapter or subsequent amendment that made the use nonconforming, but the expansion under such circumstances may not be extended to occupy land outside the original structure.
603.4 If any such nonconforming use of land or use of land and structures in combination ceases or is abandoned for any reason including destruction of buildings, for a period of at least one (1) year, any subsequent use of such land, or land and structures in combination, shall conform to the regulations for the zone district where such land is located, except that where a hardship to the operator of the nonconforming use clearly exists as a result of financial, health or other calamity, the Zoning Hearing Board may grant an extension of the one (1) year limit consistent with the hardship, but for not more than six (6) months.
603.5 Assuming no structural alterations are made to the building containing a nonconforming use, the use may be changed to a second nonconforming use but only after an application has been filed with the Zoning Hearing Board and the Board concludes that the second use is more compatible with the uses permitted in the zone district than is the original nonconforming use.
Ordinance 1065, Chapter 27 – Revised August 2017
Page 85
603.6 Each succeeding owner by purchase of a nonconforming commercial or industrial use shall secure an occupancy permit from the Zoning Officer who may ask the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision if he has reason to doubt that the nonconforming use will be continued in the same manner as formerly or in a manner more compatible with the permitted uses in the zone district.
603.7 The nonconforming use of a structure and/or land, or combination of structure and land may be superseded by a use permitted in the zone district where the property is located and the use of the premises shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zone district.
603.8 Where a nonconforming use of structure and premises exists in combination, the removal of the structure and/or use in the structure shall terminate the nonconforming use of the premises.
603.9. The maintaining or strengthening to a safe condition of any nonconforming structure shall not be interpreted as being denied by any portion of this Part.
(Ordinance 1076, October 18, 1984, Article VI, §6.3)
§604. Nonconforming Structures.
604.1 Where a structure exists on a property at the effective date of this Chapter or any amendment to it and does not conform to the requirements regarding height or minimum setbacks from adjacent streets or lot lines, such structure may remain indefinitely subject to the following provisions.
604.2 No structures may be enlarged or altered in a way that creates nonconformity or increases an existing nonconformity.
604.3 Any replacement of a nonconforming structure shall be made in compliance with the regulations governing development for the zone district in which the property is located, except that if a hardship is alleged by the owner, he may request a variance of the Zoning Hearing Board which may approve replacement on the same foundation that supported the structure to be replaced, but in no case a location that was less conforming than the original location.
604.4 If a nonconforming structure is moved, it shall thereafter conform to setback requirements regarding location on the property or be so located as to be more conforming than before the move.
(Ordinance 1076, October 18, 1984, Article VI, §6.4)
§605. Record of Nonconforming Uses.
605.1 The Zoning Officer shall identify and register all uses of land and structures in New Brighton Borough made nonconforming as a result of adoption of this Chapter.
605.2 The Zoning Officer shall keep the date current by the addition of nonconforming uses as amendments to this Chapter are adopted and by the deletion of nonconforming uses as they are eliminated.
605.3 The record may be kept by map or written documentation.
605.4 Any property owner of a nonconforming use may request a certificate of nonconformance from the Zoning Officer, guaranteeing the owner the rights of this Part. The Officer shall inspect the property and shall issue the certificate if he verifies a nonconformity exists. The certificate shall describe the nonconformity specifically. One (1) copy of the certificate or letter of certification shall be retained in the Zoning Officer's file and one copy sent to the applicant.

ARTICLE V
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
INDUSTRIAL USE OF SEWERAGE SYSTEM
Section 501. The economy and desirability of the combined treatment of industrial wastes and sanitary
sewage are recognized. It is the intent of these Rules and Regulations to accommodate the waste disposal needs of
industries within the service area of NBBSA to the extent that the industrial discharges do not inhibit or interfere
with the public sanitary sewage system's intended and required functions, cause physical damage to the structures of
the public sanitary sewage system, or cause hazard to those responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
public sanitary sewage system or to the general public. In addition, the industrial discharges must be limited in
amounts of specific contaminants of a toxic or polluting nature which may pass through the treatment system in
objectionable levels as effluent constituents and/or as a residue constituent of the sludge.
These Rules and Regulations are intended to provide the basis for this required control and protection of
NBBSA property and responsibility. It should be further understood that NBBSA and all industries are subject to
the "Toxic and Pretreatment Effluent Standards," Section 307 of Public Law 92-500. The Federal regulations
pertaining to these Federal requirements were developed by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
40 CFR, Parts 129 and 403. The EPA regulations on Pretreatment Standards control the prerogatives of NBBSA in
the control of industrial discharges, and will always supersede the requirements of these Rules and Regulations,
where discrepancies exist.
Section 502. In general, an industrial waste shall be considered harmful to the public sanitary sewage system
if it may cause any of the following damaging effects:
A. Chemical reaction either directly or indirectly with the materials of construction of the public
sanitary sewage system in such a manner as to impair the strength or durability of any sewerage
structures.
B. Mechanical action that will destroy any sewerage structures.
C. Restriction of the hydraulic capacity of any sewerage structures.
D. Restriction of the normal inspection or maintenance of any sewerage structure.
E. Danger to public health and safety.
F. Obnoxious conditions inimical to the public interest.
All such wastes shall be prohibited from discharge to the public sanitary sewage system
Section 503. For all industrial waste constituents which are not compatible with the treatment systems
and/or will persist through the treatment systems as a pollutant or toxic substance, pretreatment will be required to
the extent the objectionable constituents are reduced to acceptable levels. It is the current intent of EPA to
promulgate pretreatment standards for all known toxin and polluting substances on an industrial classification basis.
As these standards are developed, they will become applicable to all industries according to a schedule also to be
developed by EPA. EPA Standards are minimum standards which can be further altered to meet local conditions.
Until these pretreatment standards become effective, the prohibition and limits of Article VI hereof will govern.
8
Section 504. The variability of the rate of discharge from an industrial establishment is an important
consideration of the compatibility of the industrial waste with the public sanitary sewage system, and is also subject
to regulation. When the variability is considered excessive by NBBSA review or by EPA regulation, the industry
shall employ methods and means to reduce the flow rate variability to acceptable levels.
Section 505. For waste constituents compatible with the public sanitary sewage treatment system and for
which the public sanitary sewage treatment system is to provide specific removal capability, the industrial waste
shall be subject to surcharge for such constituent concentration in excess of the average influent value upon which
the plant design was based. The constituents to which surcharges are applicable include BOD5, suspended solids,
ammonia nitrogen, phosphorous, ABS, and oils, fats and greases. The allowable concentrations and surcharge
formula are given in Article VIII.
Section 506. A special industrial waste discharge permit is required for all Significant Industrial Users, as
determined by EPA regulations, discharging industrial process waters to the public sanitary sewage system. Permit
application and approval is required prior to any actual discharge being made to the public sanitary sewage system.
Each said application shall be submitted to NBBSA and shall contain the following information:
A. Description of process(es) producing the wastes.
B. Description of all pretreatment facilities being or to be utilized.
C. Description of waste being or to be discharged to the public sanitary sewage system in terms of
quantity and quality. Complete information regarding flow variability and chemical/physical/
biological constituency is required. Analysis and flow records will also be required for existing
installations or for situations where similar installations exist at some other site of the requesting
industrial establishment.
Upon review of the application, NBBSA will advise the applicant in writing of its approval or disapproval.
If disapproval is indicated, full explanation of the reason for disapproval will be given, as will be an opportunity for
the applicant to have a hearing before NBBSA for reconsideration, if so requested by the applicant within 30 days of
NBBSA's notice of disapproval.
All permits will be granted subject to cancellation by NBBSA in the event that the industrial discharge
becomes adversely different from the conditions upon which approval was originally granted.
All permittees are required to obtain amended permits for all new or different industrial discharges from
those described in the original or last amended permit.
All permits are also subject to amendment by NBBSA in the event that pretreatment requirements of EPA as
originally promulgated or amended differ from the requirements upon which the prevailing permit was based.
All permits when granted by NBBSA will describe in detail the specific monitoring requirements of the
discharge(s).
All new industrial establishments desiring to make physical connection to the public sanitary sewage system
shall be required to apply for and obtain a connection permit as described in Article X, in addition to the industrial
waste permit described in this Article V.
9
Section 507. When required by NBBSA, any person discharging to the public sanitary sewage system any
industrial wastes, or industrial wastes and sanitary sewage together, shall install a suitable manhole or manholes or
metering chamber on his connecting sewer or sewers to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
combined flow of wastes from his premises. Such manhole or manholes or metering chamber shall be accessible
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by NBBSA or its designated
representative. The manhole or manholes or metering chamber shall be installed by such person at his expense and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible to NBBSA or its designated representative at all times.
Section 508. All industrial establishments shall install fine screens to remove husk, hull, vegetable skins and
peelings, threads, lint, grease, and any and all materials considered by NBBSA to overload, impair the efficiency of,
or cause difficulties in the operation of the sewers, sewage treatment plant, or other sewer facilities.
Section 509. Although the specific monitoring requirements will be established for each permit at the time
of application review, the general guidelines for establishing these requirements, based on EPA Pretreatment
Standards (40 CFR 403), latest revision, are hereby incorporated. The categorical Pretreatment Standards found at
40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-571, latest revision, are hereby incorporated.

ARTICLE VII
SEWAGE COLLECTION, TRANSPORTATION AND TREATMENT CHARGES
Section 701. There is imposed upon the owners of, or the users of water in or on, all properties served by the
public sanitary sewage system, sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges for the use of said system,
payable in the amounts and as provided in the Sewer Rate Schedule heretofore adopted by NBBSA and as it is
hereinafter from time to time amended and modified. Said owners and users will be jointly and severally liable for
the payment of said sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges and, the penalties therein prescribed for
delinquent payments thereof.
Section 702. All bills for sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges shall be due when rendered
and shall be subject to the penalty provisions set forth in NBBSA's Sewer Rate Schedule. Owners, and where
adequate arrangements have been made with NBBSA, users will be billed periodically for the sewage collection,
transportation and treatment charges in accordance with the billing practices of NBBSA.
Section 703. NBBSA's initial sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges shall be on a water
usage and flat rate basis in accordance with NBBSA's Sewer Rate Schedule. NBBSA may, if it deems it advisable,
elect at some time in the future to impose, in whole or in part, the sewage collection, transportation and treatment
charges on such other basis as it may determine. When water usage is used as the basis for said charges, the volume
of water to be used for billing purposes shall be based upon water meter readings of the Water Authority or, in the
absence of such readings, upon estimates made by NBBSA or flat rate charges.
Section 704. When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then if an owner or user obtains part or all of
the water used in or on a property from sources other than the Water Authority, such owner or user may, after
written approval from NBBSA, at no expense to NBBSA or the Water Authority, install and maintain a water meter
or meters satisfactory to NBBSA and the Water Authority for measuring all water used other than that obtained from
the Water Authority, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewage collection, transportation and treatment
charges shall be the quantity of water measured by all such meters plus the quantity of water obtained from the
Water Authority. In lieu of such additional meters, NBBSA may establish under the Sewer Rate Schedule, a flat rate
charge which shall be applicable to such non-metered water usage.
Section 705. When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then if it is established to the satisfaction of
NBBSA that a portion of the water used in or on any property served by the public sanitary sewage system does not
and cannot enter said system, and in the event that the total water used in or on said property exceeds 100,000
gallons per quarter, NBBSA may determine, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practical, the
percentage of the water entering the public sanitary sewage system, or NBBSA may require or permit the installation
of additional meters in such manner as to determine either the quantity of water excluded from the public sanitary
sewage system or the quantity of water, sewage or industrial waste actually entering the public sanitary sewage
system. In such case, the sewage collection, transportation and treatment charge shall be based upon the quantity of
water estimated, measured or computed by NBBSA to be actually entering the public sanitary sewage system.
Section 706. When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then any person requesting consideration for
a reduction of the amount of the sewage collection, transportation and treatment charges because of water not
entering the public sanitary sewage system shall make written application to NBBSA for such consideration, giving
the name of such person, his address and setting forth supporting data fully describing other sources of water, if any,
as well as the disposition of water alleged not to be entering the public sanitary sewage system. The application
shall be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of the property, the water distribution
system, sewer layout, existing meters, and proposed meters in the scheme to determine the quantity of flow entering, 
13
or not entering, the public sanitary sewage system. The cost of furnishing, installing and maintaining any meters
other than those utilized to measure water purchased from the Water Authority shall be borne by the applicant. The
type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of such meters shall be subject to the approval of NBBSA and the
Water Authority.

Section 801. For waste constituents compatible to the public sanitary sewage system and for which the
sewage treatment works is to provide specific removal capability, the industrial waste shall be subject to surcharge
for such constituent concentration in excess of the average influent value upon which the plant design is based.
Those constituents for which surcharges are applicable are BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus,
ABS, chlorine demand, and oil, greases and fats. The surcharges shall be in addition to the regular sewage
collection, transportation and treatment charges set forth in NBBSA's Sewer Rate Schedule, and shall be payable as
therein provided.
Section 802. The concentration of the applicable surcharge constituents of any industrial waste shall be
determined not less than once per year as NBBSA shall determine, from samples taken either at the manhole or
manholes or metering chamber referred to in Article V hereof, or at any other sampling point mutually agreed upon
by NBBSA and the producer of such waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be such as, in
the opinion of NBBSA, will permit a reasonably reliable determination of the average composition of such waste,
exclusive of storm water runoff. Samples shall be collected or their collection supervised by a representative of
NBBSA and shall be in proportion to the flow of waste, exclusive of storm water runoff, and composited for analysis
in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," cited
above. Except as hereinafter provided, the strength of the waste so found by analysis shall be used for establishing
the surcharge or surcharges. However, NBBSA may, if it so elects, accept the results of routine sampling and
analyses by the producer of such wastes in lieu of making its own sampling and analyses. The specific requirements
for monitoring the waste flow for surcharge constituent strength will be determined at the time of the industrial
waste permit application referred to in Article V and will be made a condition of this permit.
Section 803. All non-residential units that discharge excess strength sewage waste into the Sanitary Sewers
shall be subject to the following surcharges:
A. Any discharge having an average 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) greater than 300 parts
per million (PPM) shall pay a surcharge equal to 1/10 of 1 percent of the quarterly charges as
computed on the quarterly bill for each ppm by which that BOD5 exceeds the 300 ppm BOD5. The
strength shall be determined no less than once each year by sampling and analysis of the discharge
for two (2) consecutive days during a period of normal operation. All analysis shall be made in
accordance with procedures outlined in the latest edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of
Water and Wastewater," cited above.
B. Any discharge having a suspended solids content greater than 250 ppm shall pay a surcharge equal to
1/10 of 1 percent of the quarterly charges for each ppm by which the suspended solids exceed the
250 ppm limit. Sampling and analysis will be conducted as described in Section 803(A).
C. Any discharge having a phosphorus concentration in excess of 10 milligrams per liter; an ammonia
nitrogen concentration in excess of 20 milligrams per liter; a concentration of oil, grease or fat in
excess of 100 milligrams per liter; or a concentration of ABS in excess of 10 milligrams per liter
shall pay a surcharge equal to 1/10 of 1 percent of the quarterly charge for each milligram per liter
that exceeds the above stated limits for each parameter. Sampling an analysis will be conducted as
described in Section 803(A).
15
D. Any discharge having a chlorine demand in excess of 15 milligrams per liter shall pay a surcharge of
1/2 of 1 percent of the quarterly charge for each milligram per liter that exceeds the above stated
limits for each parameter. Sampling an analysis will be conducted as described in Section 803(A).
16
ARTICLE IX

4. SECTION FOUR: CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR DIRECT CONNECTION
4.1. It is recognized that a circumstance may exist wherein no means of controlling
stormwater is available to a particular property except by direct connection to the System. No Person
shall make or cause to be made any connection with the Stormwater Management System until they
have fulfilled all of the following conditions and procedures:
4.1.1. Any Owner desiring to connect to the Stormwater Management System of the

service is required. No work of any nature shall commence before the issuance of said permit.
4.1.2. The application will state the address, the name of the Owner, the reason for
which the connection is necessary, the proposed use of the property, conveyance criteria
calculating anticipated stormwater flow, and the size of pipe, basins and any proposed
appurtenances.

other fees established by the Authority.
4.1.5. The application must contain a proposed date when the connection will be ready
for inspection.
4.2. When an application has been made for a stormwater connection or change in an existing
service, it is assumed that all plumbing, piping and fixtures which will be serviced are in order to receive
the service. The Authority shall not be liable in any case for any accident, breaks, or leakage arising in
any way in connection with the acceptance of stormwater flow or failure to accept stormwater flow, or
the freezing of pipes or fixtures, nor for any damage to the building or property which may result from
the usage or non-usage of stormwater service provided to the property.
4.3. At the time of the inspection of the stormwater connection, the Owner shall permit the
inspector full and complete access to all pipes and appurtenances in each Building and in and about all
parts of the property. No portion of the work shall be covered over, or in any manner concealed, until
after it is inspected and approved by the Inspector.
4.4. No stormwater lateral shall be laid in the same trench with a water, sewer or gas pipe or
with any facility of a public service company, or within three feet of any excavation or vault; without
written approval of the Authority.
4.5. Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the Authority shall at all times
reserve the right to withhold the issuance of any permit for connection to the Stormwater Management
System until the Owner provides collateral or security as the Authority in its sole and absolute discretion
deems adequate. Such security is to provide a fund from which all costs and expenses can be paid for
the construction of any necessary connection from the existing stormwater main to the property of the
Owner; in the event the Owner or any successor fails to complete the construction.
5. SECTION FIVE: CONNECTION FEES
5.1. The property Owner who is approved for connection to the System shall be responsible

installation and ongoing maintenance of best management practices.
7. SECTION SEVEN: STORMWATER LATERALS
7.1. The Owner, or his designee or contractor, must complete the actual connection to the
System, including all appurtenances, from the property. The installation of all pipe and appurtenances
must be in conformance with the Authority's Rules and Regulations. The cost for such installation is the
exclusive responsibility of the Owner.

ARTICLE I -GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 101. Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "New Brighton Borough Stormwater Management
Ordinance."
Section 102. Statement of Findings
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed
increases runoff volumes, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water
resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including reasonable regulation of development
and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the
protection of people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports
the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are intended to address the root cause of
water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate
and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green
infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls.
These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.
Section 103. Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the municipality and its watershed by
minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in Section 102 of this Ordinance, through provisions
designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect,
mair.tain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality ar.d to otherwise
protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best management practices (BMPs) that are
implemented within the municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements. 
Section 1 04. Statutory Authority
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and/or the Act of October 4,
1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167}, 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, The Stormwater Management Act.
Section 105. Applicability
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff, including land development and earth
disturbance activity, are subject to regulation by this Ordinance.
Section 106. Repealer
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality inconsistent with any of the provisions of this
Ordinance is hereby repealed to the extent of the in::onsistency only.
Section 107. Severability
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or provision of this Ordinance invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 108. Compatibility with Other Requirements
Approvals issued and actions taken under this Ordinance do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure
required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
Section 109. Erroneous Permit
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or erroneous information provided by an
applicant is void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established
pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by a board, agency or employee
of the Municipality purporting to validate such a violation.
Section 110. Waivers
A If the Municipality determines that any requirement under this Ordinance cannot be achieved tor a particular
regulated activity, the Municipality may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in
this Ordinance, subject to Section 110, paragraphs B and C.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Ordinance may be approved by the Municipality if
enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided
that the modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose of the Ordinance is
preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modification may be considered if an
alternative standard or approach will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of the Ordinance. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the Stormwater Management Site Plan submission.
The request shall provide the facts on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the Ordinance involved and
the proposed modification.
C. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity involving earth disturbance greater than or equal
to one acre may be granted by the Municipality unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.

Agricultural Activity -Activities associated with agriculture such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation,
and animal heavy use areas. This includes the work of producing crops including tillage, land clearing, plowing,
disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops or pasturing and raising of livestock and installation of conservation
measures. Construction of new buildings or impervious area is not considered an agricultural activity.
Applicant- A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an application to the municipality for approval to
engage in any regulated activity at a project site in the municipality.
Best Management Practice (BMP) - Activities, facilities, designs, measures, or procedures used to manage
stormwater impacts from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote groundwater
recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Ordinance. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one
of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "non-structural." In this Ordinance, non-structural BMPs or
measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with
stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of
practices and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale underground
treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural
stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the project site.
Conservation District- A conservation district, as defined in Section 3(c) of the Conservation District Law (3 P. S.
§ 851 (c)) that has the authority under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to administer and enforce all or a
portion of the regulations promulgated under 25 Pa. Code 102.
Design Storm- The magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation from a storm event measured in probability
of occurrence (e.g., a 5-year storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and evaluation of stormwater
management systems. Also see Return Period.
Detention Volume - The volume of runoff that is captured and released into the waters of the Commonwealth at a
controlled rate.
DEP- The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

Earth Disturbance Activity - A construction or other human activity which disturbs the surface of the land,
including, but not limited to: clearing and grubbing; grading; excavations; embankments; road maintenance; building
construction; and the moving, depositing, stockpiling, or storing of soil, rock, or earth materials.
Erosion- The natural process by which the surface of the land is worn away by water, wind, or chemical action. 
Existing Condition - The dominant land cover during the 5-year period immediately preceding a proposed
reg u Ia ted activity.
FEMA- Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Floodplain -Any land area susceptible to inundation by water from any natural source or delineated by applicable
FEMA maps and studies as being a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that comprise Group 13 Soils, as
listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended or
replaced f:"om time to time by DEP}.
Floodway - The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably
required to carry and discharge the 1 00-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as
indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have
defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is assumed--absent evidence to the contrary--that the floodway
extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
Forest Management/Timber Operations - Planning and activities necessary for the management of forestland.
These include conducting a timber inventory, preparation of forest management plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting
budgets, logging road design and construction, timber harvesting, site preparation, and reforestation.
Green Infrastructure- Systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or
reuse stormwater on the site where it is generated.
Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG)- Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as
well as surface intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and
provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local NRCS offices or
conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS1

).
Impervious Surface (Impervious Area) - A surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the ground.
Impervious surfaces (or areas} shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor living spaces, patios,
garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and any new streets or sidewalks. Decks, parking areas, and
drivewar areas are not counted as impervious areas if they do not prevent infiltration.

PA Municioalities Planning Code.
Low Impact Development (LID) - Site design approaches and small-scale stormwater management practices that
promote the use of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to
new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate, filter,
evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment
systems. LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective landscape features located on-site.

Section 303. Volume Controls
The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual4 shall be utilized for all
regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method
in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated activity areas equal or less than
one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Ordinance establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the basis of economic
considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology
and other factors.
A The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual
4
) is applicable to any size of regulated activity. This
method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
1. Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the 2-year
24-hour duration precipitation.
2. For modeling purposes:
a. Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow in good condition.
b. Twenty percent (20%) of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in good
condition in the model for existing conditions. 
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual4
) provided below is independent of site conditions and should
be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
1. Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two (2) inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
2. At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the
runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options
i'1clude reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
3. Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire
permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed
runoff should be infiltrated.
4. This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 304, Rate Controls.
Section 304. Rate Controls
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-,
25-, 50-, and 1 00-year, 24-hour storm events. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 1 00-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this
section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the
peak rate of discharge requirement.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
For the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 1 00-year, 24-hour storm events, the post-development peak discharge rates
will follow the applicable approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the
post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development discharge rates.
