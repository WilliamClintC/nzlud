J. Persons in attendance. In order to encourage public participation and

meetings of City Council, the following rules and regulations shall be in
effect: [Amended 2-25-2008 by Ord. No. 2751; 7-14-2008 by Ord.
No. 2754]
(1) Audience decorum. Members of the audience shall not engage in
disorderly or boisterous conduct, including the utterance of loud,
threatening or abusive language; clapping; whistling; stamping; or
other acts that disturb, disrupt, impede or otherwise render the
orderly conduct of the City Council meeting unfeasible. A member
of the audience engaging in such conduct shall, at the discretion of
the Mayor or a majority of the Council members, be subject to
removal from that meeting.
(2) Request to speak form. Residents or taxpayers of the City may
address the City Council during public comments and/or prior to
action on any agenda item; however, no person shall address the
Council without first being recognized by the Mayor. Any
nonresident or nontaxpayer of the City wishing to speak during
public comments or on a particular agenda item shall first properly
secure the permission of Council before the Mayor calls for public
comments or calls the particular agenda item.
(3) Purpose. The purpose of addressing the City Council is to
communicate formally with the Council by commenting on matters
of concern, official actions or deliberations which are or may be
before City Council prior to Council taking official action. Persons
addressing the City Council on an agenda item shall confine their
remarks to the matter under consideration by the Council.
§ 28-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 28-17
1:71
(4) Speaker decorum. Each person addressing the City Council shall
do so in an orderly manner and shall not engage in conduct that
disrupts, disturbs or otherwise impedes the orderly conduct of the
Council meeting. Any person who so disrupts the meeting shall, at
the discretion of the Mayor or a majority of the Council members,
be subject to removal from that meeting as is necessary to assure
the peaceful conduct of the Council meeting and the maintenance
of order during said meetings.
(5) Time limit. In the interest of fairness to other persons wishing to
speak and to other individuals or groups having business before the
City Council, each speaker shall limit his comments to five minutes.
If a large number of people wish to speak, this time may be
shortened by the Mayor so that the number of persons wishing to
speak may be accommodated within a reasonable time.
(6) Public comment, placement on agenda and overall time limit.
Public comment will be heard at the end of the meeting. However,
should a majority of the Council members determine that there is
not sufficient time at a Council meeting for residents or taxpayers
of the City to comment, Council may defer the comment period to
the next regular meeting or to a special meeting occurring in
advance of the next regular meeting.
(7) Speak only once. Second opportunities for the public to speak on
the same issue will not be permitted unless mandated by state or
local law.
(8) Addressing the Council. All comments are to be directed to the
Council as a body. Dialogue between and inquiries from citizens at
the lectern and individual Council members, the Mayor, members
of staff, or the seated audience is not permitted. Council members
seeking to gain additional information should direct their questions
through the Mayor.
(9) Yielding of time. It is understood that a person making a request to
speak does so on his own behalf. For this reason and to guarantee
all persons ample opportunity to be heard, all speakers will be
recognized for the same amount of time. No speaker will be
allowed to yield part or all of their time to another, and no speaker
will be credited with time requested but not used by another.
(10) Public comments.
(a) Nonagenda items. The agenda shall allow for public comment
on matters of concern which are not specifically listed on the
agenda. A member of the public, who wishes to speak under
public comments about a nonagenda item, must first secure
the permission of Council before the Mayor calls for public
comments. If permission is granted, persons may speak under
the public comments section of the agenda for a maximum of
five minutes and shall not be allowed to defer any portion of
§ 28-17 OIL CITY CODE § 28-17
1:72
their time to any other person. Since the City Code prohibits
City Council from taking action on any item not listed on
the agenda unless the Council agrees to revise the agenda in
accordance with the City Code, any item arising subsequent to
the final posting of the agenda must be appropriately added
to the revision of agenda section. Council members or staff
members may provide brief response to public comments when
recognized by the Mayor for the purpose of doing so.
(b) Agenda items. Subject to other applicable requirements, public
comment will be accepted on agenda items. Persons may speak
about an agenda item for a maximum of five minutes and will
not be allowed to defer any portion of their time to any other
person.
(11) Violation of the rules of decorum. Upon violation of the rules of
decorum established in Subsection J(1) or (4) above, the procedure
to enforce the rules shall be as follows:
(a) Warning. The Mayor shall first request that a person who is
violating the rules cease such conduct. If after receiving a
request from the Mayor the person persists in violating the
rules, the Mayor shall order a recess. Any representative of law
enforcement who is present at the meeting when the violation
occurs shall be authorized to warn the person that his or her
conduct is violating the rules and that he or she is requested to
cease such conduct. If upon resumption of the meeting the
violation persists, the Mayor shall order another recess,
whereupon the Mayor shall have the authority to ask the law
enforcement personnel to remove the person from the meeting
and/or to cite the person as being in violation of Section 5508
of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code.20
(b) Motion to enforce. If the Mayor fails to enforce the rules of
decorum set forth herein, any Council member may move to
require the Mayor to do so, and an affirmative vote of a
majority of the Council shall require the Mayor to do so. If the
Mayor fails to carry out the will of the majority of the Council in
this matter, the majority may designate another Council
member to act as Mayor for the limited purpose of enforcing
the rules of decorum established herein.
(c) Clearing the room. In the event that any meeting is willfully
interrupted by a person or groups of persons so as to render
the orderly conduct of such meeting unfeasible and order
cannot be restored by the removal of the individuals who are
willfully interrupting the meeting, City Council, by a majority
vote, may order the meeting room cleared, and the meeting
shall continue in session. Only matters appearing on the
20.Editor's Note: See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5508.
§ 28-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 28-17
1:73
agenda may be considered in such a session. Representatives
of the press or other news media, except those participating
in the disturbance, shall be allowed to continue to attend any
session.
(d) Violation of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code. Any person or
persons who intentionally violate(s) these rules of decorum or
who by their actions intend(s) to prevent or disturb a City
Council meeting may be prosecuted under Section 5508 of the
Pennsylvania Crimes Code for disrupting a lawful meeting.
Every person who violated Section 5508 of the Crimes Code is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.21

D. Optional military time. [Added 11-30-1988 by Ord. No. 2481;
amended 1-26-1998 by Ord. No. 2624; 8-14-2014 by Ord. No.
2832]
(1) A member of the Association is hereby granted an option which
must be exercised in writing within six months after the member
has successfully completed his or her probationary employment
period, attaining status as a full-time employee and has become a
member of the Association.
The aforementioned request will be made in writing to send to
the Police Pension Fund Board, in care of the City Manager of the
City of Oil City, 21 Seneca Street, Oil City, PA 16301, requesting
a computation of the required contribution. The amount of the
required contribution shall then be computed upon the evidence
submitted with said request, evidencing full-time active duty
service in the United States Armed Forces, rendered prior to the
member's employment with the City of Oil City Police Department.
Any current member who has not previously utilized the option to
purchase pension credit for military service will have 12 months
from the date of passage of this article to invoke his or her rights
under this section.
After being sent a notice of the required amount of the
contribution to effect purchase, a member of the Association must
pay the full amount of the required contribution to effectively
conclude a purchase of the additional service time for the purpose
of computing pension benefits.
The required contribution shall be computed by computing the
sum of the amount of a patrolman's contribution added to the
amount of the City's contribution during the years the full-time
active duty military service occurred.
§ 55-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-21
1:101
For the purposes of retirement from service, a member of the
Association who has made the required contribution or purchase
to the pension fund shall thereafter be entitled to add his or
her years of eligible service with the City as a member of the
police force, the number of years of military service for which said
required contribution of purchase has been made, not to exceed
three years of such military service. The member shall be entitled
to use any military time purchased hereunder as credit towards
his or her minimum service obligation as an active member of
the police force with a combined minimum service of 20 years,
for the purposes of retirement under City Code, Police Pension,
§ 55-21D(1).
(2) The right or option hereby granted shall be personal to a member
of the Association and may not be elected or effected by a payment
or contribution by any person other than the member of the
Association electing to effect said purchase as provided under this
section of this article.
E. Limited vested benefit. [Added 4-25-1994 by Ord. No. 2571]
(1) Each member of the association may, before completing the
minimum age and minimum period of continuous service
requirements but after having completed 12 years of full-time
service, be entitled to vest his or her retirement benefits, subject to
the following conditions:
(a) The member must file with the Board a written notice of his or
her intention to vest;
(b) The member must include in the notice the date the member
intends to terminate his or her service as a full-time police
officer;
(c) The termination date shall be at least 30 days later than the
date of notice to vest;
(d) The member must be in good standing with the Department on
the date of notice to vest; and
(e) The Board shall indicate on the notice to vest the rate of the
monthly pay of the member as of the date of said notice to vest
or the highest average annual salary which the member
received during any five years of service preceding said date,
whichever is higher.
(2) Upon reaching the date which would have been the member's
retirement date had the member continued his or her full-time
employment with the Department, the member shall notify the
Board, in writing, that the member desires to collect his or her
pension. The amount of retirement benefits the member is entitled
to receive under this section shall be computed as follows:
§ 55-21 OIL CITY CODE § 55-21
1:102
(a) The initial determination of the member's base retirement
benefits shall be computed on the salary indicated on the
notice to vest; and
(b) The portion of the base retirement benefits due the member
shall be determined by applying to the base amount the
percentage that his or her years of service actually rendered
bears to the years of service which would have been rendered
had the member continued to be employed by the Department
until his or her minimum retirement date.
F. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLA). [Added 9-25-2000 by Ord. No.
2653; amended 2-11-2002 by Ord. No. 2679]
(1) Monthly benefit increase. Members who, as of January 1, 1999,
have been retired at least five years, but less than 10 years, are
awarded an increase in their current monthly benefit equal to $25
per month; members who, as of January 1, 1999, have been retired
10 years but less than 15 years are awarded an increase in their
current monthly benefit equal to $50 per month; members who, as
of January 1, 1999, have been retired 15 years, but less than 20
years, are awarded an increase in their current monthly benefit
equal to $75 per month; members who, as of January 1, 1999, have
been retired 20 years, but less than 30 years, are awarded an
increase in their current monthly benefit equal to $150 per month;
and members who, as of January 1, 1999, have been retired 30
years or more are awarded an increase in their current monthly
benefit equal to $300 per month. These cost-of-living increases
shall be offset by any other COLA(s) awarded to these retirees
either by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other entity,
including the City of Oil City.
(2) Annual cost-of-living adjustments. An annual cost-of-living
adjustment (COLA) shall be made to all members who have retired
after a minimum of 20 years of active service, excluding members
that are retired on a disability pension, in which case the minimum
years of active service shall not apply. That adjustment shall be
equal to and upon the release of the percentage increase in the
United States Department of Labor's CPI for the preceding year,
with a maximum cap on such increase of 4.0% per year. There shall
be an additional restriction that no increase shall allow the pension
amount of any retiree to exceed 1/2 of the current salary being paid
to a police officer of the highest pay grade. There shall also be a cap
on the cumulative increases of the COLA equal to 50% of the
original monthly benefit of each retiree. In the event that the
minimum municipal obligation (MMO) calculation as required
under Pennsylvania Act 205 of 1984 as prepared by the City's Chief
Administrative Officer and accepted by City Council indicates that
a contribution to the Police Pension Plan is required after
application of member contributions, there will be a suspension of
the COLA increases until the subsequent MMO calculation
§ 55-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-21
1:103
§ 55-22. Disability pension. [Amended 7-12-1971 by Ord. No. 2249;
5-7-1973 by Ord. No. 2280; 3-28-1994 by Ord. No. 2570]
indicates that no contribution is required. If a suspension of the
COLA increases is required, such suspension shall be effective
beginning January 1 of the year following the preparation and
acceptance of the MMO calculation. Likewise, COLA increases
shall again become effective on January 1 of the year following the
preparation and acceptance of the MMO calculation that indicates
that no contribution is required. In the event that a COLA
suspension is necessary, the Police Pension Board shall be notified
in writing of that circumstance. All costs associated with the
calculation and administration of this COLA provision will be borne
by the fund. [Amended 4-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2682]
A. Definition. As used in this section, "total disability" shall mean
permanent mental or physical impairment which renders the police
officer unable to perform his duties.
B. Work-related disability benefits.
(1) Any police officer who dies or becomes totally disabled due to
injuries sustained in the line of duty shall be deemed to be fully
vested in the Police Pension Fund, regardless of the annual number
of years of credited service and shall be eligible for immediate
retirement benefits.
(2) Claims under this section shall be decided by the governing body of
the City. Proof of disability shall be competent medical evidence
provided by the claimant. The governing body of the City may at
any time have the claimant examined by its own physician.
(3) Claims under this section may be brought as the regulations of the
City Council prescribe. Hearings and appeals shall be as provided
in Title 2 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (relating to
administrative law and procedure).
(4) The Pension Fund shall be subrogated to the right of the claimant
to the extent of any payments made under the Act of June 2, 1915
(P.L. 736, No. 338), known as the "Pennsylvania Workmen's
Compensation Act."32
C. Non-work-related disability benefits. Any police officer who has less
than 10 years of service and who dies or is totally disabled due to
injuries or mental incapacities not in the line of duty and is unable to
perform the duties of a police officer shall be entitled to a pension of
25% of his annual compensation. For death or injuries received after 10
years of service, the compensation shall be 50% of his annual
compensation.

D. Payment of benefits. The disability pension shall be payable to the
police officer during his lifetime, and if he shall die, the pension
payment that he is receiving shall be continued to be paid to his spouse
if such person survives or, if such person subsequently dies or
remarries, then the child or children under the age of 18 years of the
police officer.
E. Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of the sworn
statements of three practicing physicians of the City of Oil City,
designated by the Board to examine the member, to the effect that such
member is in a permanent condition of health which will wholly and
permanently disable him from performing the duties of a police officer,
and each member making application for such pension shall submit to
examination by three physicians designated by the Board before
consideration shall be given to his application by the Board. The Board
may, in its discretion, require proof in addition to the sworn statements
of the three physicians designated by it.
A. If a member of the Association contributing to the fund shall be
dismissed from the police force of the City of Oil City, or for any cause
cease to be a member of the force before he or she becomes entitled to
a pension hereunder, his or her membership in the Association and his
or her right to pension shall forthwith cease, but in such event the total
amount of the contributions paid into the fund by such person shall,
upon request, be refunded to him or her in full without interest.
B. If such person received a refund, as herein provided, and shall later
reenter the employ of the City as a member of the police force, such
member may return to the pension fund the amount withdrawn, in
which event the period of 20 years herein provided for shall be
computed by including the period during which he or she was
previously employed as a member of the police force, otherwise the
period shall be computed from and after the date of reemployment.
C. In the event of the death of a member of the Association before he or
she becomes entitled to the pension herein provided for, the total of the
contributions paid into the fund by said member shall be paid to the
estate of said deceased employee without interest.
D. In the event of the death of a member of the Association while receiving
a pension hereunder, but before the amount of the pension received
shall equal the total amount of contributions paid into the fund, the
difference between the amount received as pension and the amount
contributed to the fund by the deceased member shall be paid to the
estate of said deceased employee.
§ 55-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-24

their total contributions out of salary or wages into the fund, and no
person shall be entitled to payments of pension except out of property
or moneys in excess of said sum.
B. If at any time the excess over the amount required to repay to the then

members.

the payments so made shall not in any case exceed in any one year
1/2 of the annual pay of such member computed at such monthly
or average annual rate, whichever is the higher. [Amended
2-14-1977 by Ord. No. 2344; 2-23-1998 by Ord. No. 2625;
6-25-2001 by Ord. No. 2662]
(2) Each member retired herein shall be subject to service from time to

(3) Should any paid fireman who, having attained the age of 65 years
and having been in service of the Bureau of Fire for a period of 20
years, desire not to be retired from active service, he may apply to
the Board of Managers to be retained in active service, provided
that he procure at his cost a statement in writing from two

retired from service and shall, subject to the limitations and
restrictions herein contained, receive from the fund during the
remainder of his or her natural life in monthly installments an
annual pension in an amount equal to 50% of the annual pay of
such member, computed at the monthly rate of such member at the
date of his retirement or at the highest average annual salary
which the members received during any five years of service
preceding the date of retirement, whichever shall be the higher;
provided, however, that, except as to service increments, the
payments so made shall not in any case exceed in any one year 1/2
of the annual pay of such member computed at such monthly or

(5) No person shall be entitled to the payments of pension under this
section at any time or during any period that the principal of the
fund and the accumulated interest thereon shall be insufficient to
repay in full to all the members of the Bureau of Fire of the City of
Oil City then contributing toward the fund and entitled to
participate therein, or their estates, as herein provided, the amount
of their total contributions out of salary or wages into the fund.
§ 55-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-44
1:115
(6) If at any time the excess in said fund over and above that required
to repay contributions to the members of the Bureau of Fire of the
City of Oil City then contributing toward the fund and entitled to
participate therein, or their estates, is insufficient to pay in full all
pensions which may then be due and payable, such excess shall be
apportioned among all of the persons then entitled to pensions in
proportion to the amount of pension due them respectively, and all
pensions then due and payable shall be abated proportionately.
B. Service increment. In addition to the retirement allowance hereinabove
provided for, and notwithstanding the limitations therein placed upon
such retirement allowances and upon contributions, every contributor
who shall become entitled to the retirement allowance shall also be
entitled to the payment of a service increment in accordance with and
subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth:
(1) Service increment shall be the sum obtained by computing the
number of whole years after having served the minimum required
by this article during which a contributor has been employed by the
City and paid out of the City Treasury and multiplying said number
of years so computed by an amount equal to 1/40 of the retirement
allowance which has become payable to such contributor in
accordance with the provisions of this article. In computing the
service increment, no employment, after the contributor has
reached the age of 65 years, shall be included, and no service
increment shall be paid in excess of $100 per month.
(2) Each contributor shall pay into the retirement fund a monthly sum
in addition to his or her retirement contribution which shall be
equal to 1% of his or her salary, provided that such payment shall
not exceed the sum of $1 per month, and provided that such service
increment contribution shall not be paid after a contributor has
reached the age of 65 years.

(4) Service increment contributions shall be paid at the same time and
in the same manner as retirement contributions and may be

retirement contributions may be withdrawn, or by persons who
retire before becoming entitled to any service increment.
C. Widows.
(1) A widow of a member of the Association shall be entitled to receive
during her lifetime the pension payable to the member or which
would have been payable had he been retired at the time of his
death if such member was retired on pension on or after January 1,

1968, or was killed or died in the service on or after January 1,
1968. [Amended 2-14-1977 by Ord. No. 2344; 10-10-1994 by

be entitled to receive a pension calculated at and amounting in the
aggregate to 50% of the pension payable to the member had he
been retired at the time of his death. [Amended 10-10-1994 by
Ord. No. 2575]

in addition to his or her retirement contribution and service
increment contribution, which shall be equal to 1% of his salary.
(4) Widow's pension contribution shall be paid at the same time and in
the same manner as retirement contributions and may be
withdrawn in full, without interest, by persons who leave the
employment of the City before they become entitled to a pension
hereunder, and in the event that the member dies leaving no widow
to survive him and no child or children eligible to receive payments,
the total of the widow's pension contributions paid into the fund by
said member shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member.
D. Limited vested benefit. [Added 10-10-1994 by Ord. No. 2575]
(1) Each member of the Association may, before completing the
minimum age and minimum period of continuous service
requirements, but after having completed 12 years of full time

retirement date had the member continued his or her full-time
employment with the Department, the member shall notify the
Board, in writing, that the member desires to collect his or her
pension. The amount of retirement benefits the member is entitled
to receive under this subsection shall be computed as follows:
(a) The initial determination of the member's base retirement
benefits shall be computed on the salary indicated on the
notice to vest; and
(b) The portion of the base retirement benefits due the member
shall be determined by applying to the base amount the

had the member continued to be employed by the Department
until his or her minimum retirement date.

military service occurred.
(4) For purposes of retirement from service, a member of the
Association who has made the required contribution or purchase to
the pension fund shall thereafter be entitled to add to his or her
years of eligible service with the City as a member of the Fire
Department the number of years of military service for which said
required contribution or purchase has been made, not to exceed

the Association and who is not eligible for pension under any of the
other provisions of this article and who dies or shall become
permanently and totally disabled as a result of injury incurred while
engaged in active duty and in the regular service rendered the City, and
whether the same is compensable under the workers' compensation
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or otherwise, and who shall,
by reason of such injury or sickness, be rendered totally and
permanently unable to engage in the duties of an active member of the
Bureau of Fire shall, upon due proof to the Board of such permanent
and total disability, be eligible to receive a normal pension from the
fund beginning forthwith and continuing during his lifetime.

not connected with service for the City shall be entitled to a benefit of

E. Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of the sworn
statements of three practicing physicians, designated by the Board to

condition of health which will wholly and permanently disable him from
performing the duties of an active member of the Bureau of Fire. Each
member making application for such pension shall submit to an
examination by three physicians designated by the Board before
consideration shall be given to his application by the Board. The Board
may, in its discretion, require proof in addition to the sworn statements
of the three physicians designated by it, and notwithstanding
acceptance by the Board of proof of total and permanent disability, a
member shall from time to time upon demand by the Board, but not
more often than once a year after such disability has continued for two
years, for the purpose of verifying that said disability is actually total
and permanent, furnish due proof that he actually continues in the state
of disability defined above, and should the Board at any time upon
reasonable cause conclude that said member is not totally and
permanently disabled, it shall discontinue the payments of pension of
such member.
F. No person shall be entitled to the payments of pension under this
section at any time or during any period that the principal of the fund
and the accumulated interest thereon shall be insufficient to repay in
full to all of the members of the Bureau of Fire of the City of Oil City
their contribution toward the fund, and entitled to participate therein,
or their estate, as herein provided, the amount of their total
contributions out of salary or wages into the fund.
G. If at any time the excess of said fund over and above that required to
repay contributions to the members of the Bureau of Fire of the City of
Oil City then contributing toward the fund and entitled to participate
therein, or their estates, is insufficient to pay in full all pensions which
may then be due and payable, such excess shall be apportioned among
all of the persons then entitled to pensions in proportion to the amount
of pension due them respectively, and all pensions then due and payable
shall be abated proportionately.

computed by including the period during which he or she was
permanently employed as a member of the Bureau of Fire; otherwise,
the period shall be computed from and after the date of reemployment.

cease on the date on which such leave of absence commenced. During
any authorized leave of absence, a participant shall continue to receive
credit for years of credited service to the extent such credit is
specifically granted in writing by the employer and is permitted

required to have contributions deducted from the participant's
compensation and contributed to the plan at a rate of 3 1/2% of the
participant's compensation subject to taxation under IRS Code
Section 3101(a) and 5% of the remainder of the participant's
compensation.
(2) Each participant who makes an election under § 55-56D and each
employee who became a participant of the plan on or after January
1, 1993, shall be required to have contributions deducted from the
participant's compensation and contributed to the plan at a rate of
5% after the effective date of such election or participation.
(3) Each participant who makes an election pursuant to § 55-56E to be
covered by the service increment benefit shall be required to
contribute an amount in addition to the percentages hereinbefore
prescribed equal to 0.5% of the participant's compensation after
the effective date of such election; provided, however, that such
service increment contribution shall not be paid after the
participant attains age 65.
(4) Effective January 1, 1993, the employer has elected to reclassify
employee contributions as employer contributions pursuant to
Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2), which reclassification
shall result in a reduction of the participant's taxable gross income
for federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of such
reclassified contributions.
B. Employer contributions. The actuary, in accordance with the Act, shall
annually determine the minimum municipal obligation of the employer.
The employer shall pay into the pension fund, by annual appropriations
or otherwise, the contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum
municipal obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall preclude the employer from contributing an amount in
excess of the minimum municipal obligation.
C. State aid. General municipal pension system state aid, or any other
amount of state aid received by the employer in accordance with the
Act from the commonwealth, may be deposited into the pension fund
governed by this article and shall be used to reduce the amount of the
minimum municipal obligation of the employer.

otherwise any money or property, real or personal, for the benefit of the
plan and cause the same to be held as a part of the pension fund. The

vested in the Council or its delegate, the plan administrator, subject to
the direction of the donor and not inconsistent with applicable laws and
the terms of the plan.
§ 55-55 OIL CITY CODE § 55-55

§ 55-56. Retirement benefits.
E. No reversion to the employer. At no time shall it be possible for the plan
assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution
is returned within one year of the discovery of the mistaken payment of
the contribution or the plan is terminated, as provided in § 55-63.
A. Normal retirement. Each participant shall be entitled to a normal
retirement benefit after retirement on or after attainment of normal
retirement age.
B. Normal retirement benefit.
(1) Each participant who shall become entitled to a benefit pursuant to
Subsection A hereof shall receive a benefit commencing on the
participant's normal retirement age and paid in the normal form as
provided in § 55-59A hereof. The annual amount of the normal
retirement benefit shall be equal to 2.5% of the participant's
average annual compensation multiplied by the participant's years
of credited service up to a maximum benefit of 50% of average
annual compensation.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each
participant shall have the normal retirement benefit determined
hereunder reduced by an amount equal to 40% of the primary
insurance amount of social security paid or payable to the
participant. Such reduction shall commence as of the attainment of
the age at which social security benefits are payable to the
participant and determined as of that date based only on the
compensation for services rendered in employment and shall only
be redetermined if a decrease in the social security primary
insurance amount shall result in a corresponding decrease in the
amount of the reduction determined herein.
C. Late retirement. A participant may continue in employment beyond the
attainment of normal retirement age, subject to the employer's rules
and regulations regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met
the requirements of Subsection A continues in employment beyond the
participant's normal retirement age, there shall be no retirement
benefits paid until employment has ceased and the participant's
retirement actually commences. The retirement benefit of a participant
described in this Subsection C shall be calculated in accordance with
Subsection B on the basis of average annual compensation as of the
participant's actual retirement and shall commence on the participant's
late retirement date.
D. Elimination of social security reduction.
§ 55-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-56
1:129
(1) Each participant of the plan as of January 1, 1991, who shall retire
after January 1, 1991, shall be eligible to eliminate the social
security primary insurance amount reduction applicable in the case
of a benefit payable pursuant to Subsection B hereof.
(2) Each participant who makes an election, prior to retirement, to
eliminate the said reduction shall be required to make employee
contributions at the rate of 5% of the participant's compensation
commencing on the date such election is made. Such a participant
must pay, in a lump-sum payment at the time of election or in
installment payments as agreed by Council, an amount equal to the
difference between the participant's actual accumulated
contributions at the time of election and the employee
contributions which would have been paid if the participant had
paid all employee contributions at the rate of 5% of the
participant's compensation. A participant who makes such an
election after January 1, 1993, shall also be required to pay interest
calculated from January 1, 1993, to the date of payment at a rate
equal to the average percentage interest gain on plan investments
from January 1, 1993, to the date of determination.
(3) Each participant who makes an election after retirement to
eliminate the said reduction shall pay, in a lump-sum payment at
the time of election, an amount equal to the difference between the
participant's actual accumulated contributions at the time of
election and the employee contributions which would have been
paid if the participant had paid all employee contributions at the
rate of 5% of the participant's compensation. A participant who
makes such an election after January 1, 1993, shall also be required
to pay interest calculated from January 1, 1993, to the date of
payment at a rate equal to the average percentage interest gain on
plan investments from January 1, 1993, to the date of
determination. Such elimination shall be effective after the date the
said election is made and shall not require any adjustment on
account of benefit payments received prior to the date such
election is made unless otherwise specifically approved by Council.
E. Service increment.
(1) Each participant of the plan as of January 1, 2001, who shall retire
after January 1, 2001, and each future employee may elect to be
covered by the service increment benefit by notifying the plan
administrator in writing by December 31, 2000, or within 30 days
of the employee's first day of employment. A participant who does
not make such an election and/or does not authorize the deduction
of employee contributions in accordance with § 55-55A as
applicable to participants covered by the service increment benefit
shall forever waive and relinquish the opportunity to be covered by
the service increment benefit.
§ 55-56 OIL CITY CODE § 55-56
1:130
(2) A participant who has elected to be covered by the service
increment benefit pursuant to the preceding paragraph and who
retires after completing 20 years of credited service shall be
entitled to receive a service increment benefit in addition to the
retirement benefit determined under Subsection B. The amount of
the service increment benefit shall equal 1.25% of average annual
compensation multiplied by the total number of completed whole
years of credited service in excess of 20 years. In computing the
amount of service increment benefit, years of credited service
completed after the participant attains age 65 shall not be
included. [Amended 6-25-2007 by Ord. No. 2738]
(3) A participant who retires after electing to be covered by the service
increment benefit but is not eligible for a service increment benefit
may withdraw the amount of accumulated contributions
attributable to the service increment benefit.
F. Early retirement. Each participant whose employment is terminated
prior to his normal retirement age, other than by death or disability, but
after early retirement date shall be entitled to an early retirement
benefit.
G. Early retirement benefit. Each participant who shall become entitled to
a benefit pursuant to Subsection F shall receive a benefit commencing
on the early retirement date, paid monthly in an amount equal to the
participant's accrued benefit, reduced by 0.5% for each full month by
which the early retirement date precedes the normal retirement age.
H. Application for benefit. A participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit on a form and in the manner prescribed by the
plan administrator and deliver the said application to the plan
administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit
payments are to commence. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments or any other
benefit payments shall be due or payable on or before the first day of
the month coincident with or next following the date that is 30 days
after the date the plan administrator receives the application for
benefit.
I. Limitation of liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
employer, the plan administrator, any fiduciary or any agent or
representative of any of the foregoing to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided
from the assets available in the pension fund, whether such benefits are
in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms of the plan. The
Council retains the right to amend or terminate this article consistent
with applicable law at any time, with or without cause, and whether or
not such action directly or indirectly results in the suspension,
reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the plan or in pay
status, and without liability to any person for any such action.
§ 55-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-56
1:131
J. Special provision for restated plans.
(1) The benefit amount of any participant who may have retired prior
to the restatement date shall not be in any way altered by the
provisions of this article, except where otherwise expressly
indicated herein, and shall continue to be determined on the basis
of the terms of the plan in effect on the day preceding the
restatement date.
(2) Pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, each participant under
the plan as of the restatement date may be entitled to all of the
benefits, rights or features of the plan as in effect prior to the
restatement date. Such participants shall therefore be entitled, to
the extent required under applicable law, to the greater of the
benefits, rights and features determined in total under this
amended and restated plan or the sum of the benefits, rights and
features determined in total and accrued as of the restatement date
plus the benefits, rights and features determined in total and
accrued after the restatement date. As of the restatement date,
there shall be no further accruals of the benefits, rights and
features determined in total pursuant to the terms of the plan prior
to the restatement date.
K. Maximum benefit limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
article to the contrary, no benefit provided under this article
attributable to contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual
amount, the amount specified in IRS Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) as
adjusted pursuant to IRS Code Section 415(d), assuming the form of
benefit shall be a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The
limitations described in this Subsection K shall be governed by the
following conditions and definitions:
(1) Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to
the plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis to determine the limitation contained
herein;
(2) In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of
age 62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on
an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant
to this section commencing at age 62; however, in the case of a
qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a period
of at least 15 years of service, including applicable military service,
as a full-time employee of a police or fire department is taken into
account in determining the amount of benefit), the limitation
contained in this Subsection K(2) shall not apply;
(3) In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age
65 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
§ 55-56 OIL CITY CODE § 55-56
1:132
§ 55-57. Disability retirement.
actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined herein
commencing at age 65;
(4) Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all
defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an
annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this
section, provided that the employer has not at any time maintained
a defined contribution plan in which the participant has
participated;
(5) In the case of a participant with fewer than 10 years of service or
participation, the limitation expressed in this Subsection K shall be
reduced by 1/10 for each year of participation less than 10 with
respect to IRS Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) or each year of service
less than 10 years in the case of the limitation in Subsection K(4),
but in no event shall this limitation be less than 1/10 of the
applicable limit;
(6) The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for
calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all
defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one
defined contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted
consistent with IRS Code Section 415 and regulations thereunder
as applicable to government plans in general and this article in
particular; and
(7) In the case of a survivor benefit under § 55-58B or a disability
retirement benefit under § 55-57B, the adjustment under
Subsections B and E hereof shall not apply, and the applicable
limitation shall be the limitation contained herein without regard to
the age or years of service or participation of the benefit recipient.
A. Disability retirement. A participant who has completed at least 15 years
of credited service and who incurs a total and permanent disability
before attaining normal retirement age shall be entitled to a disability
retirement benefit as of the disability retirement date.
B. Disability retirement benefit. A participant who shall be entitled to a
disability retirement benefit under Subsection A shall receive a benefit
commencing on the participant's disability retirement date and paid in
the normal form as provided in § 55-59A hereof. For a participant whose
total and permanent disability was incurred in the line of or as a direct
result of the participant's duties of employment with the employer, the
annual amount of the disability retirement benefit shall be equal to 50%
of the participant's average annual compensation. For a participant
whose total and permanent disability did not occur in the line of duty,
the annual amount of the disability retirement benefit shall be equal to
25% of the participant's average annual compensation.
§ 55-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-57
1:133
§ 55-58. Death benefits.
C. Payment of disability benefit. Payment of a disability retirement benefit
shall be made in the normal form under § 55-59A commencing on the
participant's disability retirement date and ending on the earlier of the
date of death of the participant or the date that the participant's total
and permanent disability shall cease. If the participant's total and
permanent disability shall cease prior to the attainment of the
participant's normal retirement age, the participant shall be deemed to
have terminated employment as of the disability retirement date for
purposes of this article unless the participant shall resume active
employment within three months following the date on which such total
and permanent disability ceased. A participant who fails to resume
active employment after total and permanent disability ceases shall not
be entitled to a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to
§ 55-60B to the extent that the total amount of disability retirement
benefits paid exceeds the value of the participant's accumulated
contributions as of the disability retirement date and shall not be
entitled to any other benefits under the plan as a result of the
accumulation of any years of credited service as of the disability
retirement date.
D. Verification of disability. The plan administrator shall determine
whether a participant shall have incurred a total and permanent
disability, and in the case of a service-related disability, that the total
and permanent disability was directly related to the participant's duties
of employment. Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of
the sworn statement of three practicing physicians, designated by the
plan administrator, that the participant has incurred a total and
permanent disability and that it was directly related to the participant's
duties of employment, if applicable. If the plan administrator shall
determine that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled
has recovered sufficiently to resume active employment or if a
participant refuses to undergo a medical examination as directed by the
plan administrator (such a medical examination may not be required
more frequently than once in any given twelve-month period), the
payment of disability retirement benefits shall cease.
E. Cessation of disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this article must notify the plan
administrator of any change in condition which may cause the
participant's entitlement to receipt of such benefits to cease. If a
participant fails to provide immediate notice to the plan administrator
of any such change in status, and thereby continues to receive payment
of benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, the plan
administrator may take whatever action is necessary and permitted
under applicable law to recover any amount of improper payments,
including offsetting such amounts against any future payment of
retirement or other benefits under the plan or legal action. The plan
administrator may also recover the costs of any such action.
§ 55-57 OIL CITY CODE § 55-58
1:134
A. Death of participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a participant,
there shall be benefits payable in accord with the following sections of
this § 55-58.
B. Survivor benefits.
(1) Before retirement eligibility. If a participant shall die after 15 years
of credited service while still an employee of the employer, a
survivor benefit shall be payable as described in Subsection B(3). If
the participant's death was incurred in the line of or as a direct
result of the participant's duties of employment with the employer,
the amount of the survivor benefit shall be equal to 37.5% of the
participant's average annual compensation as of the date of death.
If the participant's death was not service related, the amount of the
survivor benefit shall be 25% of the participant's average annual
compensation as of the date of death.
(2) After retirement eligibility or actual retirement. If a participant
shall die after commencement of benefit payments hereunder
pursuant to § 55-56B, C, F and § 55-57A or after attaining a normal
retirement age under the plan or reaching his early retirement
date, while still an employee of the employer, a survivor benefit
shall be payable as described in Subsection B(3) in an amount
equal to 75% of the amount that the participant was receiving (in
the case of a retired participant) or 75% of the accrued benefit (in
the case of an active participant) the participant would have been
eligible to receive had the participant retired on the date of death.
The accrued benefit applicable to a participant who had not yet
reached a normal retirement age under the plan shall include early
retirement reductions pursuant to § 55-56G. Notwithstanding the
preceding, survivor benefits shall not be subject to any reduction
for social security. In no event shall the survivor benefit payable
under this § 55-58B(2) be less than the amount calculated pursuant
to § 55-58B(1) for participants who die before retirement eligibility.
(3) Payment of survivor benefits. The survivor benefit shall be paid to
the surviving spouse, if any, until the date of death of the surviving
spouse. Upon the death of the surviving spouse, or if there is no
surviving spouse, the survivor benefit shall be paid in equal shares
to the surviving dependent children of the deceased participant.
Dependent children shall include the children of the deceased
participant who have not attained 18 years of age. The shares
payable to the surviving dependent children shall be adjusted as
each child ceases to be eligible to receive a share of the benefit
hereunder.
C. Death prior to retirement. If a participant shall die prior to the
commencement of the payment of any retirement or other benefits
under this article, and without eligibility for payment of a survivor
benefit under Subsection B, the beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a
distribution of the participant's accumulated contributions determined
§ 55-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-58
1:135
§ 55-59. Payment of benefits.
as of the date of death of the participant. If the participant has received
disability retirement benefits hereunder, the amount of distribution of
accumulated contributions shall be reduced by the amount of disability
retirement benefits which have been paid hereunder.
D. Death after retirement. If a participant shall die after the payment of
any retirement or other benefits under this article have commenced,
except as provided for in Subsection B, there shall be no entitlement to
any additional payments hereunder, and all obligation to the
participant, the participant's beneficiary, or any other party claiming
any right, title or interest by way of the participant's participation
herein shall cease. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the total of the
benefit payments to the participant and surviving spouse, if applicable,
were less than the amount of the participant's accumulated
contributions at the time of retirement, the balance shall be paid to the
participant's beneficiary.
A. Normal form. The normal form for payment of retirement benefits shall
be an annuity for the life of the participant paid monthly.
B. Commencement of benefits. Except as otherwise provided herein, a
participant may make an election to commence receiving distribution of
retirement benefits as of the participant's early retirement date, normal
retirement age or late retirement date, whichever is applicable,
provided the participant has completed the required years of credited
service, or may defer such payments to a date not later than the
required date for commencement of benefits determined under
Subsection C. Retirement benefit payments shall be paid as of the first
day of each month, and the first benefit payment shall be in an amount
equal to the participant's regular monthly benefit multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the
participant's retirement date to the end of the month, and the
denominator of which is the full number of days in the applicable
month.
C. Required distributions.
(1) Time frame for distribution.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the entire
benefit of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits
prior to death shall be distributed either:
[1] Not later than the required beginning date; or
[2] Over a period beginning not later than the required
beginning date and extending over the life of such
participant or over the lives of such participant and a
designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending
beyond the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint
§ 55-58 OIL CITY CODE § 55-59
1:136
life expectancies of such participant and a designated
beneficiary).
(b) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this article
dies prior to the date when the entire interest has been
distributed after distribution of benefits has begun in
accordance with Subsection C(1)(a)[2] above, the remaining
portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly as
under the method of distribution being used under Subsection
C(1)(a)[2] as of the date of death.
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this article dies
before distribution of the benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions shall begin not later than one year after the date of
the employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; then for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2; and further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin, this subsection shall be applied
as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(a) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2 or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
(b) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this article according to its
rules.
(c) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
§ 55-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-59
1:137
(d) For purposes of this subsection, the life expectancy of an
employee and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case
of a life annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently
than annually.
D. Small amounts. If the plan administrator determines that the value of a
participant's accrued benefit is so small as to make pension payments in
the normal form administratively impractical, the plan administrator
may cause such payments to be made at such other periodic intervals as
are administratively practical, but no less frequently than annually.
E. Nonduplication of benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a
participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under this article and
who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit
payments, such participant shall receive the greater of the amount of
the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon average
annual compensation and years of credited service as of the date that
such period of resumed employment shall cease.
F. Personal right of participant. The right to receive any benefits under
this article is a personal right of the participant and shall expire upon
the death of the participant. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary,
assignee or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have
any interest in any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so
provided by the terms of this article. A participant's election, failure to
make an election or revocation of an election hereunder shall be final
and binding on all persons.
G. Direct rollovers.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by
the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) "Eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except
that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under IRS Code Section 401(a)(9); and
the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross
§ 55-59 OIL CITY CODE § 55-59
1:138
§ 55-60. Termination of employment.
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section
of the plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be
an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not
includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid
only to an individual retirement account or annuity described
in Section 408(a) or (b) of the IRS Code, or to a qualified
defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a)
of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(b) "Eligible retirement plan" is a qualified trust described in IRS
Code Section 401(a), an individual retirement account
described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement
annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan
described in Code Section 403(a), an annuity contract
described in Code Section 403(b), an eligible plan under
Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred
into such plan from this article.
(c) "Distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in IRS Code Section
414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the
spouse or former spouse.
(d) "Direct rollover" is a payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
A. Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this article limited to those contained in the
following sections of this § 55-60.
B. Distribution of accumulated contributions. A participant whose
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason other
than death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of early
retirement date or normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a
distribution of accumulated contributions. Upon receipt of such
§ 55-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-60
1:139
accumulated contributions, said participant and beneficiary shall not be
entitled to any further payments from the plan.
C. Deferred retirement benefit.
(1) A participant who shall have completed at least 12 years of credited
service and whose employment with the employer shall terminate
for any reason other than death or total and permanent disability
prior to attainment of normal retirement age shall be entitled to
elect to receive a deferred retirement benefit in lieu of a
distribution of accumulated contributions under Subsection B.
Such a deferred retirement benefit shall be in an amount equal to
the accrued benefit determined as of the date the participant's
employment terminated and shall commence when the participant
attains a normal retirement age. A participant may elect to
commence payments at his early retirement date, in which case,
the accrued benefit shall be reduced for early commencement
pursuant to § 55-56G. No benefits shall be payable until application
for a benefit has been made under § 55-56H hereof.
(2) Involuntary termination. Notwithstanding the preceding, a
participant who shall have completed at least 12 years of credited
service and whose office or employment with the employer shall be
terminated without his voluntary action, other than due to death or
total and permanent disability, prior to completion of 20 years of
credited service shall be entitled to elect to receive a deferred
retirement benefit in an amount equal to the accrued benefit and
shall commence on or after the date on which the participant
attains age 60 and after application for benefit has been made
under § 55-56H hereof, in lieu of the benefit described in the
preceding subsection.
(3) A participant who shall have completed at least 20 years of credited
service and whose office or employment with the employer shall be
terminated without his voluntary action, other than due to death or
total and permanent disability, prior to attainment of a normal
retirement age shall be entitled to elect to receive a deferred
retirement benefit in an amount equal to the participant's accrued
benefit as of the date of termination of employment, in lieu of the
benefit described in the first paragraph of this Subsection C. If such
an election is made, the participant must continue to pay
contributions into the pension fund on a monthly basis equal to the
monthly amount due and paid under § 55-55 during the last full
month of employment, with such contributions to continue until the
participant attains 55 years of age. Such deferred retirement
benefit shall commence thereafter upon application pursuant to
§ 55-56H. [Amended 6-25-2007 by Ord. No. 2738]
D. Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not
be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal
process and shall be payable only to the participant or designated
§ 55-60 OIL CITY CODE § 55-60
1:140
§ 55-61. Administration.
beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer unless the
subject of a domestic relations order mandated by a court of competent
jurisdiction that clearly provides for proper distribution of a portion of
the pension benefit payments to an alternate payee (former spouse of
the participant) and does not require any benefit to be paid in excess of
the available earned and accrued under the plan.
E. Forfeiture. Rights under this article shall be subject to forfeiture as
provided by the act of July 8, 1978 (P.L. 752, No. 140), known as the
"Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act."
A. Plan administrator. The Pension Plan Board shall be the plan
administrator and shall have the power and authority to do all acts and
to execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments necessary to
implement and effectuate the purpose of this article. The plan
administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf to any persons

Council shall be the plan administrator.
B. Pension Plan Board.

City Manager, a retired City employee and two participants to be
chosen by the participants who are contributing to the pension
fund as well as one member of Council.

until the earliest of death, resignation or removal. Each member,
not including the Mayor, City Controller or City Manager, of the
Pension Plan Board may resign by giving written notice to the
Council and other members of the Pension Plan Board 30 days prior
to the date of resignation. Any vacancy on the Pension Plan Board
shall be filled in accord with the provisions governing initial
appointment as a member of the Pension Plan Board.
(3) The Pension Plan Board may organize itself in any manner deemed
appropriate to effectuate its purposes hereunder, provided that:
(a) It shall act by a majority of its members at the time in office
either by vote at a meeting or in writing without a meeting;
(b) It shall appoint a Chairman, a Secretary who may, but need not
be a Pension Plan Board member, and such other agents as it
may deem advisable;
(c) It may authorize any one or more of its members to execute any
document or documents including any application, request,
certificate, notice, consent, waiver or direction and shall notify
the Council, in writing, of each such member so authorized;
§ 55-60 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-61
1:141
however, if no such member is so authorized, the Chairman
shall be deemed to be so authorized;
(d) It shall meet at least one time in each plan year; and
(e) It shall maintain and keep such records as are necessary for
the efficient operation of the plan and preservation of the
Pension Fund or as may be required by any applicable law,
regulation or ruling, and shall provide for the preparation and
filing of such forms, reports or documents as may be required
to be filed with any governmental agency or department and
with the participants and/or other persons entitled to benefits
under the plan.
C. Authority and duties of the plan administrator.
(1) The plan administrator shall have full power and authority to do
whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the
proper administration and operation of the plan. The interpretation
or construction placed upon any term or provision of the plan by
the plan administrator or any action of the plan administrator taken
in good faith shall be final and conclusive upon all parties hereto,
whether employees, participants or other persons concerned. By
way of specification and not limitation and except as specifically
limited hereafter, the plan administrator is authorized:

(h) To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the
administration of the plan, including such legal, clerical,
accounting, actuarial and investment services as may be
required by any applicable law or laws.
§ 55-61 OIL CITY CODE § 55-61
1:142
(2) The plan administrator in its capacity as plan administrator shall
have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of the
plan or change or add to any benefits provided by the plan, or to
waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for benefits
under the plan. Further, the plan administrator shall have no power
to adopt, amend or terminate the plan, or to determine or require
any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to the Council in its capacity as the governing body of the
employer.
D. Plan administration expense. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the plan administrator, including, but not limited to, fees
of accountants, counsel, actuaries and other specialists and other costs
of administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon
approval by the plan administrator to the extent permitted under
applicable law and not otherwise paid by the employer.
E. Hold harmless. No member of the Council nor the plan administrator
nor any other person involved in the administration of the plan shall be
liable to any person on account of any act or failure to act which is
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing their respective
duties under the terms of this article. To the extent permitted by law,
the employer shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold
harmless the plan administrator and each successor and each of any
such individual's heirs, executors and administrators, and the plan
administrator's delegates and appointees (other than any person, bank,
firm or corporation which is independent of the employer and which
renders services to the plan for a fee) from any and all liability and
expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action,
suit or proceeding to which he is or may be made a party by reason of
being or having been the plan administrator or a delegate or appointee
of the plan administrator, except in matters involving criminal liability,
intentional or willful misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance
to cover claims of a nature described above, then there shall be no right
of indemnification except to the extent of any deductible amount under
the insurance coverage or to the extent of the amount the claims exceed
the insured amount.
F. Approval of benefits.
(1) The plan administrator shall review and approve or deny any
application for retirement benefits within 30 days following receipt
thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under the
circumstances.
(2) Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
G. Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
§ 55-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-61
1:143
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant") shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
(1) Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
(2) If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the plan administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth:
(a) The specific plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(b) An explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(c) An explanation of the review procedure.
(3) Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by the Council of the
initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Council within 60 days of receipt of such notice of
denial. During such review, the claimant or a duly authorized
representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The
Council shall, within 60 days after receipt of the notice requesting
such review (or in special circumstances, such as where the
Council in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of
receipt of such notice), submit its decision in writing to the person
or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent plan provisions on
which the decision is based.
(4) Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted, unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
(5) A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
§ 55-61 OIL CITY CODE § 55-61
1:144
§ 55-62. The pension fund.
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
(6) Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a
claimant to appeal any final decision hereunder to a court of
competent jurisdiction under 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 752. No decision
hereunder is a final decision from which such an appeal may be
taken until the entire appeal procedure of this § 55-61G of the plan
has been exhausted.
A. Operation of the pension fund.
(1) The Council of the City of Oil City is hereby authorized to hold and
supervise the investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject
to the provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and of this article and any amendment thereto.
(2) The pension fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the
plan and, to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the
expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.
(3) The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the
exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the
contributions to the pension fund required under the plan. The
employer shall not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in
the pension fund; benefits are payable only from the pension fund
and only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
(4) The pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer
under the plan, including contributions made pursuant to the
provisions hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds
thereof. The pension fund shall be held, managed and administered
pursuant to the terms of the plan. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in the plan, the employer has exclusive authority and
discretion to manage and control the pension fund assets. The
employer may, however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or
investment manager, at its sole discretion.
B. Powers and duties of employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition
to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law, unless such duties
are delegated.

situated, including in those cases where a bank has been appointed
to serve as trustee hereunder the savings department of its own
commercial bank.
(8) In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all
of the powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.
(9) To maintain and invest the assets of this article on a collective and
commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans

respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
(10) To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
article with assets of other eligible, participating plans through
such a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the
plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be
subject to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust,
as amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
§ 55-62 OIL CITY CODE § 55-62
1:146
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan,
to the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the plan.

out the provisions of the plan, provided that, if a trustee is

distribution only at the direction of the employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the plan.
(13) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without

assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against
or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.
(15) To appoint any persons or firms (including, but not limited to,
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other
specialists) or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the fund; to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that act),
or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose
of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one state; in
such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it be

assets which are subject to the management of such investment
manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the employer.
C. Common investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account but may invest contributions
and any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
D. Compensation and expenses of appointed trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out his functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days' written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse
itself for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
E. Periodic accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually or at more frequent intervals by the trustee, and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
F. Value of the pension fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof
shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions
shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto, the
participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers
and other experts and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
A. Amendment of the plan. The employer may amend this article at any
time or from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the
name of the employer under its municipal seal by officers duly
authorized to execute such instrument and delivered to the Council;
provided, however:
§ 55-62 OIL CITY CODE § 55-63
1:148
(1) That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any
beneficiary of a deceased participant of any of the benefits to which
each is entitled under this article with respect to contributions
previously made;
(2) That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this article other than for the benefit of employees, and no
funds contributed to this plan or assets of this plan shall, except as
provided in § 55-63E, ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the
employer; and
(3) That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 55-64C has been prepared and presented to the Council in
accordance with the Act.
B. Termination of the plan. The employer shall have the power to
terminate this plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in
writing executed in the name of the employer.
C. Automatic termination of contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the pension fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment
for the benefit of its creditors.
D. Distribution upon termination.
(1) In the event of the termination of the plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such
termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the plan,
the employer shall direct either that the plan administrator
continue to hold the vested accrued benefits of participants in the
pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other
than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such
termination until all funds have been distributed in accordance
with the provisions or that the plan administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the vested
accrued benefit to the date.
(2) If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan termination, priority
shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to
mandatory or voluntary employee contributions before assets are
applied to the distribution of any vested benefits attributable to
other sources hereunder.
(3) All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be
distributed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of
§ 55-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-63
1:149
§ 55-64. Funding standard requirements.
applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the
employer which effects such termination.
E. Residual assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the pension fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as
such return does not contravene any provision of law, and any
remaining balance in excess of employer contributions shall be
returned to the commonwealth.
F. Exclusive benefit rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the plan as provided herein, the employer shall dispose
of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan and
applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan shall any part of the corpus or income of the pension fund,
after deducting any administrative or other expenses properly
chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants in the plan, their
beneficiaries or their estates.
A. Actuarial valuations.
(1) The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least
biennially. Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as
of the beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered
calendar year, beginning with the year 1985. Such actuarial
valuation shall be prepared and certified by an approved actuary, as
such term is defined in the Act.
(2) The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act or
any other expenses which are permissible under the terms of the
Act and which are directly associated with administering the plan
shall be an allowable administrative expense payable from the
assets of the pension fund. Such allowable expenses shall include
but not be limited to the following:
(a) Investment costs associated with obtaining authorized
investments and investment management fees;
(b) Accounting expenses;
(c) Premiums for insurance coverage on fund assets;
(d) Reasonable and necessary counsel fees incurred for advice or
to defend the fund; and
(e) Legitimate travel and education expense for pension plan
officials; provided, however, that the municipal officials of the
§ 55-63 OIL CITY CODE § 55-64
1:150
§ 55-65. Miscellaneous.
employer, in their fiduciary role, shall monitor the services
provided to the plan to ensure that the expenses are necessary,
reasonable and benefit the pension plan; and, further provided,
that the plan administrator shall document all such expenses
item by item and, where necessary, hour by hour.
B. Duties of chief administrative officer.
(1) Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the chief administrative officer.
(2) The chief administrative officer of the plan shall determine the
financial requirements of the plan on the basis of the most recent
actuarial report and shall determine the minimum municipal
obligation of the employer with respect to funding the plan for any
given plan year. The chief administrative officer shall submit the
financial requirements of the plan and the minimum municipal
obligation of the employer to the plan annually and shall certify the
accuracy of such calculations and their conformance with the Act.
C. Benefit modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the chief administrative officer of the plan
shall provide to the Council a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary,
which estimate shall disclose to the Council the impact of the proposed
benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements of the
plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the employer with
respect to the plan.
A. Employment rights. Participation in this plan shall not give any right to
any employee to be retained in the employ of the employer nor shall it
interfere with the right of the employer to discharge any employee and
to deal with such employee without regard to the effect that such
treatment might have upon participation in this plan.
B. Meaning of certain words. As used herein, the masculine gender shall
include the feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural in
all cases where such meaning would be appropriate. Headings of
sections are inserted only for convenience of reference and are not to
be considered in the construction of the plan.
C. Information to be furnished by the employer. The employer shall furnish
to the plan administrator (and, where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer's possession as the plan administrator and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
the plan.
D. Severability of provisions. Should any provisions of this article be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts of this article, and the plan shall be
§ 55-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-65
1:151
construed and enforced as if said illegal and invalid provisions had
never been inserted herein.
E. Incapacity of participant. If any participant shall be physically or
mentally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
payment of pension benefits hereunder, the plan administrator, upon
the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining the
participant and that no guardian or committee has been appointed for
the participant, may provide for such payment of pension benefits
hereunder to such person or institution so maintaining the participant,
and any such payments so made shall be deemed for every purpose to
have been made to such participant.
F. Pension fund for sole benefit of participants. The income and principal
of the pension fund are for the sole use and benefit of the participants of
this plan and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be free, clear and
discharged from and are not to be in any way liable for debts, contracts
or agreements, now contracted or which may hereafter be contracted,
and from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred by any
participant or beneficiary.
G. Benefits for a deceased participant. If any benefit shall be payable
under the plan to or on behalf of a participant who has died, if the plan
provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the
participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant's estate
is pending in the court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan
administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to the surviving
spouse of such deceased participant, or if there be no such surviving
spouse, to such participant's then living issue, per stirpes; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the plan
administrator from insisting upon the commencement of estate
administration proceedings and the delivery of any such benefits to a
duly appointed executor or administrator.
H. Assets in pension fund. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
give any participant or beneficiary any interest in any specific property
of the pension fund or any right except to receive such distributions as
are expressly provided for under the plan.
I. Personal liability. Subject to the provisions of the Act and unless
otherwise specifically required by other applicable laws, no past,
present or future officer or agent of the employer or plan administrator
shall be personally liable to any participant, beneficiary or other person
under any provision of the plan.

§ 84-1. Purpose and findings.
A. The registration fee required under § 80-3 of this chapter shall be $25
per vacant property as defined in § 80-1. In addition to the yearly fee
required by this chapter, any person who is found to be in violation of
this chapter shall, upon conviction in any summary proceeding, post a
one-time nonrefundable security deposit for each and every property
owned and required to be registered by this chapter in an amount equal
to 1/2 the assessed value of the registered property.
B. For any person who fails to pay the registration fee or the
nonrefundable security deposit required in § 80-7A in full when due,
said amount shall constitute a debt due and owing to the City, and the
City may enter a lien on any violating property as provided by law.
A. Purpose.
(1) Pursuant to the authority granted in the Third Class City Code to
promote and secure the health, cleanliness, comfort and safety of
the citizens of the City of Oil City; to regulate and inspect the use
and occupancy of public buildings; to regulate places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation; and to prevent and
prohibit public nuisances due to adverse secondary effects, the City
§ 80-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 84-1
1:157
of Oil City (hereinafter "City") enacts this chapter to minimize and
control the adverse secondary effects of adult-oriented businesses
and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens;
protect the citizens' property values and the character of
surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of blight.
(2) The City has determined that licensing is a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of
adult-oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and
to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their
establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
(3) The City does not intend this chapter to suppress any speech
activities protected by the First Amendment but to enact a contentneutral
ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adultoriented
businesses. It is not the intent of the City enacting this
legislation to deny any person their rights of speech protected by
the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or both, nor is it the intent of the
City to impose by this chapter any additional limitations or
restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and other
materials. Further, by enacting this chapter, the City does not
intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view,
or both, any sexually oriented materials or conduct protected by
the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or both, nor does it intend to
restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that
distributors or exhibitors may have to sell, distribute or exhibit
these sexually oriented materials.
B. Legislative, judicial and research findings. The City finds:
(1) Law enforcement personnel have determined, and statistics and
studies performed in a substantial number of communities in this
commonwealth and in the United States have indicated, that adultoriented
businesses have adverse secondary effects, including
those specified and recognized at 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 5501(a), which
secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public's
health, safety and welfare. These secondary effects include, but are
not limited to, the spread of communicable diseases; the
performance of sexual acts in public places; the presence of
discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private
property; sexual harassment; obscenity, prostitution and other
illegal sexual activities; crime; decreased property values and
neighborhood deterioration.
(2) Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult-oriented businesses on the community as presented: a) in
depositions and hearings conducted by the United States District
§ 84-1 OIL CITY CODE § 84-1
1:158
Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and the United States
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania; b) on
findings incorporated in the following cases: City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 41 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
501 U.S. 560 (1991); c) from studies and reports from other cities
throughout the country, including, but not limited to, Phoenix,
Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Biloxi, Mississippi; Seattle, Washington;
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas;
and d) on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's
Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses,
(June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); the City finds:
(a) Adult-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently
uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments, and there
is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these
establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
(b) Certain employees of adult-oriented businesses as defined in
this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher
incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than other
employees of other establishments.
(c) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex,
occur at adult-oriented businesses, especially those which
provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing
films, videos or live sex shows. Furthermore, adult bookstores
tend to attract homosexual men who engage in unprotected,
high-risk sexual activities. Offering and providing such space
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy
conditions.
(d) Persons frequent adult theaters, adult arcades and other adultoriented
businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within
the premises of such adult-oriented businesses.
(e) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in adult-oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus
infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, Hepatitis B, Non A and
Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(f) The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and
HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact,
intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood
components, and from an infected mother to the newborn.
§ 84-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 84-1
1:159
(g) According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and
HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally
transmitted by sexual acts.
(h) Sanitary conditions in some adult-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of
the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of
the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain their
facilities.
(i) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is
found in areas of adult-oriented businesses where persons view
adult-oriented films.
(j) Numerous studies have indicated that adult-oriented
businesses have a substantial negative impact on property
values and cause neighborhood blight.
(k) The findings noted in Subsection B(2)(a) through (j) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
(3) Adult-oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects in the
nature of creating a public nuisance, which secondary effects
should be regulated to protect the public health, safety and welfare
of the general public.
(4) Adult-oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial government concerns.
(5) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
operators of the adult-oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see
that their adult-oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent
with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as
well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the adult-oriented business, fully in possession and control of the
premises and activities occurring therein.
(6) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises that have adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters and bookstores.
(7) Requiring licensees of adult-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incidences of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential

1:160
§ 84-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following word and phrases shall have the
meanings indicated unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
ADULT ARCADE  Any place in which the public is permitted or invited
wherein coin-operated, slug-operated or, for any form of consideration,
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in
such establishments.
(8) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
adult-oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of
such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually-transmitted
diseases.
(9) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to
such activity.
(10) The fact that an applicant for an adult-oriented-business-use
license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the
rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that
conduct in the breach of the provisions of this chapter. The barring
of such individuals from the ownership and/or management of
adult-oriented businesses in the City serves as a deterrent to and
prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(11) The limitation of operating hours of adult-oriented businesses from
8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and closure of
such businesses on Sunday and holidays reduces the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses, including, in particular, latenight
noise levels, crime, sexually offensive materials and activities
in public areas, as well as promoting the public health, safety and
welfare.
(12) The reasonable regulation and supervision of adult-oriented
businesses tends to discourage sexual acts and prostitution and
thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of patrons, clients
and customers of these businesses.
(13) The continued unregulated operation of such adult-oriented
businesses would be detrimental to the general health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the City.
(14) The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the City
will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

reimbursement process for the Oil City Fire Department for any costs

services by submitting claims to the property owner and/or his
insurance carrier.
B. It is the finding of the City that property owners generally maintain
insurance coverage within their own casualty insurance policies,
property owner policies and/or other applicable policies that would
provide reimbursement to the Fire Department for provided
suppression services, equipment and personnel to save and protect
their property from the perils insured against.
C. Any person, property owner, business, firm, corporation or organization
that is rendered services under this section shall provide the Oil City
Fire Department with the following information:

and any tenants.
(2) Name, address, policy number and agent of the insurance carrier
(if applicable).
D. The Fire Chief or his/her designee is hereby authorized and directed to
obtain all necessary and pertinent insurance information concerning
the property, and to take necessary and affirmative actions to apply for
and receive reimbursement from any insurance carriers where a
property owner is or may be insured so that the Fire Department may
be reimbursed for any cost and/or expense incurred for services,
supplies and/or equipment used for or provided to the property owner
by the Oil City Fire Department.

§ 154-11. Manner of excavating and refilling.
A. Excavation shall be by open cut from the surface, and no tunneling or
drifting will be permitted except by permission and when so noted on
the permit. The amount of trench opened and also the amount unfilled
shall be at all times subject to the decision of the Department. No
trench or excavation shall be undercut or have a greater width at the
bottom than at the top. In case of slips or slides of the sides of the
excavation, the same shall be trimmed to solid earth and the top surface
cut back to the limit of the same before any backfilling is commenced.
When necessary or required by the Department, the sides of a trench
shall be sheathed and braced and rendered secure until the
construction has been laid therein and the trench refilled. Care shall be
taken not to move or disturb other subsurface structures, and in
crossing these or running parallel with or near them, they shall be
securely hung, braced and supported in place until the work is
completed. The applicant shall maintain their respective services and
shall repair all damage done to any of said structures. In rock
excavation, all drilling and blasting shall be conducted with the greatest
possible care and all possible precautions taken to guard against
accidents.
B. All excavations shall be carefully refilled promptly after the completion
of the structures with such of the excavated materials as may be
suitable. All materials used for backfill shall be in proper condition, all
frozen or wet and soggy earth must be removed and replaced with
filling of proper consistency. Coarse, lumpy or cloddy earth must be
pulverized before being returned to the trench. From November 15 to
April 1, all excavations in paved streets shall be refilled with crushed
stone, thoroughly compacted, if in the opinion of the Department
§ 154-9 OIL CITY CODE § 154-11
1:238
weather conditions render the same necessary, or the Superintendent
may, in his discretion, refuse to issue any permit during said period, or
he may issue said permits under such special restrictions or conditions
as he may deem necessary. No rock fragments larger than nine inches
in any dimension shall be placed in the trench. The space between the
pieces of rock shall be filled with earth and tamped. Earth filling shall
be placed in layers not exceeding six inches and thoroughly tamped
with iron rammers not over 36 square inches of face and not less
than 20 pounds in weight or with an approved mechanical tamper. All
backfilling shall be done in the ratio of one man shoveling to two men
tamping or ramming. Puddling or water-tamping may be done only
by special permission or direction of the Department. In case of any
deficiency of proper material for backfilling, the same shall be supplied
by the applicant.
C. All materials used in the base and surfacing of any street or roadway,
and which may be reused, shall be removed in accordance with such
instructions as may be issued from time to time and carefully laid aside
for future use. Such materials shall be kept separate from other
excavated materials, and the applicant shall be held responsible for the
preservation of such materials. In all unimproved streets, the surface of
the trenches, after being filled and settled, shall be finished in a most
workmanlike manner without needless delay and shall in every respect
be equal in quality, character and materials to the street surface
existing previous to making the excavation.
D. In case of an excavation in a paved street or public highway, the
backfilling shall be carried up to a point about 18 inches below the
surface of the road and the filling left in an oval or convex shape. From
this point upward to the bottom of the material of the improved road,
the trench shall be widened nine inches on each side, but the surface of
the road shall not be disturbed for a width greater than the width of the
trench below the enlarged section. Into this enlarged section of trench
shall be placed concrete composed of one part cement, two parts sand
and four parts gravel, broken stone or slag. This concrete arch shall be
not less than six inches thick at the crown. Should the width of the

12-22-1986 by Ord. No. 2456]
The Police Department is hereby authorized and directed to carefully note
all excavations in the streets and sidewalks of the City and the patrolmen to
make special report of the same through the Chief or Captain of Police to
the Department of Public Works. When the work is done without permit, the
officer shall insist that the same be stopped, pending the securing of such.
In all cases of the opening of streets, whether party exhibits permit or not,
patrolmen shall report.
§ 154-13. Notice of intention to pave or repave street; effect.
[Amended 12-22-1986 by Ord. No. 2456]
Upon the passage of a resolution by the City Council to the effect that
it is the intention of the Council to pave or repave any street or alley
or part thereof within one year from the passage of such resolution, the
City Engineer shall notify all public service corporations maintaining or
likely to maintain underground structures in said street of the passage of
said resolution, and such corporations shall thereupon make any additions,
repairs or alterations in their underground structures which they think
may be required within a period of five years. The City Engineer shall
also ascertain whether properties abutting said street, whether vacant or
otherwise, are provided with water and sewer services to the curbline. In
case any properties are not provided with water service, the City Engineer
shall notify the Director of the Department of Public Works, and the latter
shall install services to the curbline. In case any such properties are not
provided with sewer connections, the City Engineer shall notify the owner
of such property, and it shall be the duty of said owner to construct a sewer
connection from the main to the curbline within 30 days. Upon failure of any
owner to construct such sewer connection within 30 days from notification
so to do, the Department of Public Works shall construct the same. The first
cost of such sewer construction shall be paid from the general fund, and the
actual cost of each of said sewer connections, plus 15% to cover overhead,
shall be charged to the property owner and added to the latter's assessment
for the improvement of the street. Such sewer connection charges shall,
however, be shown separately on the assessment schedule and shall not be
payable upon the installment plan, as the paving assessment proper, but
shall be paid in full with the first payment on the paving assessment, and
the City Treasurer shall credit the amounts paid for sewer connections to
the general fund.
§ 154-14. Excavations in recently improved streets.
Except in case of emergency, no permit for excavating in any street covered
by a resolution providing for its improvement, as set forth in § 154-13, shall
be issued within the period commencing three months after the passage
barricades, etc., shall cease. [Amended 12-22-1986 by Ord. No.
2456]

of said resolution and ending five years after the completion of the
improvement. The City Engineer shall, within one month after the passage
of any such resolution, cause to be posted along the line of the proposed
improvement handbills setting forth the passage of the resolution and the
provisions of this section. The emergency exceptions to the provisions
of this section shall be restricted to cases where immediate excavation
is necessary for the protection of life or public or private property, as
provided in § 154-7 hereof, and to such other cases as may seem of sufficient
importance as to secure a favorable vote of 4/5 of the members of the City
Council.
§ 154-15. Violations and penalties. [Amended 9-8-1986 by Ord. No.
2452]
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon
conviction thereof, be punishable by a fine not exceeding $300 and costs
of prosecution or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days, or by
both such fine and imprisonment.

§ 170-1. Authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,49 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Oil City Council does hereby order as follows.

General Provisions
§ 170-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 170-3. Applicability.
§ 170-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 170-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.

ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Oil City or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from

or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
B. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted
by the applicant which sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the
Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request.
A. Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this
chapter or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain
Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
(3) Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the
performance of any act it requires;
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be
deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or agent
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state; and
(5) Contain an outline of remedial action which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this chapter or who fails or refuses to
comply with any notice, order of direction of the Floodplain
Administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall pay a fine
to the City of Oil City of not less than $25 nor more than $600 plus costs
of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or noncompliance with, this chapter shall not excuse the
violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue, and all such

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 170-17. Identification.
§ 170-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas in the City of Oil City
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs),
dated January 16, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the City of Oil City and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District identified as floodway in the FIS, which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS.
(1) Within any floodway area, encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall not be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no
floodway has been delineated.
(1) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use
or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development would not, together with all other existing and

§ 170-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the FEMA
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. Additionally, as soon as practicable,
but not later than six months after the date such information becomes
available, a community shall notify the FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data.
§ 170-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the City Engineer, and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Oil City
Planning Commission. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
anticipated development, increase the BFE more than one foot at
any point.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no onepercent
annual chance flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where other
acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to
allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.

ARTICLE I
Disorderly Houses
[Adopted 10-19-2009 by Ord. No. 2771]
§ 208-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Oil City Disorderly House
Ordinance."
§ 208-2. Authority.62
This article is enacted pursuant to Section 2414 of the Third Class City
Code, 53 P.S. § 37414.
§ 208-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the City of Oil City by eliminating the proliferation of residences harboring
occupants who disturb the peace and tranquility of their neighborhoods.
The processes currently available do not adequately control unlawful or
nuisance activity or its detrimental effects on citizens and neighborhoods
where such activity occurs. These regulations and prohibitions are intended
to protect the physical, mental and social well-being of the residents of the
City of Oil City.
§ 208-4. Findings.
The Council finds that there is a need to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the City of Oil City by eliminating the
proliferation of residences harboring occupants who disturb the peace and
tranquility of their neighborhoods, and the chronic unlawful or nuisance
activity of various kinds on and near disorderly properties diminishes the
quality of life in neighborhoods where this activity occurs. Specifically, the
Council finds that maintaining or permitting a disorderly house:
A. Frequently promotes and causes criminal misconduct in the
surrounding neighborhood that disturbs the peace, that affects public
health, safety and welfare, and creates a nuisance in that residents
neighboring a disorderly house are deprived of the enjoyment of their
homes, disturbed in their sleep, and otherwise prevented from the quiet
enjoyment of their residential premises;
B. Affects the property values of residences in the City;
C. Affects the public welfare by reflecting negatively on the quality of life
in residential areas of the City;
D. Disturbs the peace and good order of the City; and
E. Creates a public nuisance.

§ 255-15. Permit for industrial wastes.
The discharge of industrial wastes into the sewer system without the
consent of the City is hereby prohibited. Any industrial establishment
desiring to discharge industrial wastes into the sewer system shall make
application to the City for a permit therefor. The applicant for such permit
shall furnish the City with such information as is required for the purpose
of determining whether the proposed discharge of industrial wastes will
conform with the requirements of the ordinances of City Council and the
rules and regulations provided for herein. The granting of such permit may
be made contingent upon the applicant providing and maintaining, at the
expense of the applicant, apparatus for regulating the rate of discharge
and/or treating such wastes prior to discharge and for the proper sampling
thereof, from time to time, as the City may deem necessary.
§ 255-16. Measuring volume for purposes of sanitary sewage rates
and industrial waste rates.
BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand
ss = Suspended solids
ppm = Parts per million
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the waterworks
discharges sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer
system, the volume of water used, as determined from meter
readings of the City, shall be used in computing the sewer rental.
(2) In cases where persons have sources of water supply in addition to
or other than from the waterworks, and discharge sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system, those persons shall
provide a meter on such additional or other source of supply. The
total amount of water consumed as shown by the meter readings
under Subsection A(1) and (2) will be used in computing the sewer
rental.
(3) In cases where persons use water from the waterworks and/or from
an independent supply such that all or any part of the water so used
is not discharged into the water system, the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer rental shall be computed by one of the
following methods:
(a) Method No. 1. By placing a meter or measuring device on the
sewer connection. The readings therefrom shall be used in
computing the sewer rental.
(b) Method No. 2. By placing a meter or measuring device on the
effluent not discharging into the sewer system. The readings
therefrom will then be deducted from the total water meter

payable upon presentation.
readings, and the remainder will be used in computing the
sewer rental.
(c) Method No. 3. Where in the opinion of the Sewer Manager, it is
not practical to install measuring devices to continuously
determine the quantity of water not discharged to the sewer
system, the Sewer Manager will determine, in such manner
and by such method as he may prescribe, the percentage of
metered water discharged into the sewer system, and the
quantity of water used to compute the sewer rental shall be the
percentage so determined of the quantity measured by the
water meter or meters. Any dispute as to the estimated amount
shall be submitted to the Council, after notice of the estimate,
whose decision on the matter shall be final for the then current
calendar year.
B. Measuring devices. All meters or measuring devices not provided by
the waterworks but required to be used under the provisions of this
article shall be furnished and installed by the property owner and shall
be under the control of the City and may be tested, inspected or
repaired by employees of the City whenever the Council deems
necessary. The owner of the property upon which such measuring
device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and
safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at the property
owner's expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary
wear and tear or other causes. Where such meter by reason of lack of
space or arrangement of pipeline shall be installed within the street
line, such meter shall be furnished by the property owner and shall be
installed by the City at the property owner's expense; the City shall be
responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto
shall be made at the property owner's expense. Bills for such repairs, if
made by the City, shall be due and payable at the same time and
collected in the same manner as are the bills for sewer services; such
bills from and after their due date shall constitute a lien upon the
property upon which or for the benefit of which such measuring device
is installed.
C. Meter reading. The City shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or measuring devices, and they shall be made available to
employees of the City for meter reading at any reasonable time.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 274-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Oil City
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 274-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the City of Oil City finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpointsource
pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare
and the protection of the people of the City of Oil City and all the people
of the commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 274-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-3
1:379
§ 274-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within

restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best management
practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.

for meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in
this chapter, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of and
do not conflict with state law, including, but not limited to, the Clean
Streams Law.
E. All regulated activities shall include, to the maximum extent
practicable, measures to:
(1) Protect health, safety and property.
(2) Meet the water quality goals of this chapter by implementing
measures to:
§ 274-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-11
1:395
(a) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, natural slopes,
existing native vegetation and woodlands.
(b) Create, maintain or extend riparian buffers and protect
existing forested buffers.

maximum extent practicable and at the discretion of the Municipal
Engineer, the total impervious area on the parcel may be subject to
the requirements of this chapter.
G. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the applicant must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
(1) Applicant must provide an executed easement for proposed
concentrated flow across adjacent properties to a drainageway or
public right-of-way.
§ 274-11 OIL CITY CODE § 274-11

(2) Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
H. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
I. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
(with a minimum total width of 20 feet) shall be provided conforming to
the line of such watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, maintenance, including mowing of vegetation within
the easement, may be required, except as approved by the appropriate
governing authority.
J. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.

water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls or stream
enclosures, etc.) that are regulated by this chapter, that will be located
in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (including wetlands),
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility
of the applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.

seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged where soil
conditions and geology permit to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
§ 274-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-11
1:397
§ 274-12. Exemptions/modifications.
O. Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the site, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this
chapter.
P. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers,
or roadside ditches in order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
the municipality shall permit it on a case-by-case basis.
Q. Applicants are encouraged to use low-impact development practices to
reduce the costs of complying with the requirements of this chapter and
the state water quality requirements.

B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activities areas greater than one acre, or which require
detailed design of stormwater management facilities, the Design Storm
Method shall be followed. For regulated activity areas equal or less
than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the
stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no preference for either
method; therefore, the applicant may select either method on the basis
of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of
the analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other
factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions and shall be completed by a
qualified professional.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For proposed impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from proposed impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
§ 274-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-14
1:403
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration test
shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual. A
minimum forty-eight-hour notification of the municipality shall
be provided to allow witnessing of the testing.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either § 274-14B(1) or (2), the following procedure
shall be performed and documented by a qualified professional:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided
to justify the decision to not use infiltration BMPs:
[1] Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and
test locations).
[2] An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water occurring on the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative
shall identify depth to seasonal high-water tables and
depth to bedrock and provide a description of all
subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive
layers, geology, etc.) that influence the direction and rate
of subsurface water movement.
[3] A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to
annual aquifer recharge shall be made, along with
identification of any restrictions or limitations associated
with the use of engineered infiltration facilities.
[4] The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
a professional engineer or geologist.
(b) The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be
required for all disturbed areas within the proposed
development:
Pollutant Load Units
Required

Total suspended solids
(TSS)
Pounds 85%
Total phosphorous (TP) Pounds 85%

§ 274-16. Sensitive areas and stormwater hot spots.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within Venango County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty- and one-hundred-year storms.89
A. Sensitive areas, as defined below, and stormwater hot spots which
require special consideration with regard to stormwater management.
(1) Sensitive areas are defined as those areas within a delineated zone
of contribution to a drinking water source that has the potential to
endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the delineated oneyear
zone of contribution and direct upslope areas tributary to the
water supply wells. Municipalities may update the sensitive area
boundaries based on new research or studies.
(2) Stormwater hot spots are land development projects that have a
high potential to endanger local water quality and could potentially
threaten groundwater reservoirs. The Municipal Engineer will
determine what constitutes these classifications on a case-by-case
basis. The PADEP wellhead protection contaminant source list shall
be used as a guide in these determinations. Industrial
manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas must
provide NPDES SIC codes.
B. Performance standards.
(1) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be
determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the
limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the sensitive
area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If the project
site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive
area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the limits of the
sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
plan to document the site's location relative to the sensitive area.

(2) Stormwater hot spot developments may be required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file notice of
intent as required under the provision of the EPA industrial
stormwater NPDES permit requirements.
(3) Stormwater hot spot developments must use an acceptable
pretreatment BMP prior to volume control and/or rate control
BMPs. Acceptable pretreatment BMPs for these developments
include those based on filtering, settling or chemical reaction
processes such as coagulation.
(4) Stormwater hot spot developments and development in sensitive
areas must include riparian buffers as defined in Article VI.

Riparian Buffer Standards
§ 274-19. Riparian buffer requirements.
Riparian buffers are required for regulated activity other than one singlefamily
residence and shall be established as follows:
A. The buffer shall be measured perpendicularly from the top of the
stream bank landward.
(1) High quality or exceptional value watersheds: a minimum of 150
feet;
(2) Impaired watersheds: a minimum of 150 feet;
(3) All other watersheds: a minimum of 50 feet; or
(4) As determined by a stream corridor study approved by PADEP and
the municipality.
B. The riparian buffer shall be located on both sides of all perennial and
intermittent streams. The perennial and intermittent streams and the
riparian buffer boundaries shall be shown on all applications for
building permits, subdivision or land development. Existing uses within
the buffer are permitted to continue but not be expanded. Placement of
new buildings or roadways within the riparian buffer shall be
prohibited, unless specifically permitted by PADEP. Where a wetland
exists within the buffer area, the buffer shall be extended landward to
provide a minimum buffer of 25 feet, as measured perpendicularly from
the wetland boundary.
C. The buffer shall be undisturbed forest consisting of appropriate native
species.
D. Where wetlands are located partially or entirely within a buffer, the
buffer shall be extended to encompass the wetland and shall be
widened by a distance sufficient to provide a twenty-five-foot forested
buffer measured perpendicularly from the wetland boundary.
E. The following uses shall be permitted in the buffer:
(1) Footpaths, trails and bike paths, provided that:
(a) Width is limited to five feet;
(b) Width may be increased provided a corresponding increase in
the buffer is provided; and
(c) Construction shall have minimal impact to the buffer.
(2) Stream crossings, provided the crossing is designed and
constructed in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the
buffer. The riparian buffer shall be restored to its original
§ 274-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-19
1:413
condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon completion of
construction.
(3) Utility lines, provided that the crossing is designed and constructed
in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the inner buffer, and
provided that there is no practical alternative to locating the utility
line within the buffer. The riparian buffer shall be restored to its
original condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon
completion of construction.
(4) Maintenance and restoration of the riparian buffer.
(5) Projects conducted with the objective of improvement,
stabilization, restoration or enhancement of the stream bank,
stream channel, floodplain, watershed hydrology, riparian buffers,
or aquatic habitat and maintenance activities associated with such
projects. These projects include, but are not limited to, agricultural
and stormwater management best management practices. Such
projects must receive appropriate permits and approvals from
PADEP prior to starting the project.
(6) Minor private recreational uses for the property owner. Such uses
include benches, fire rings and similar uses. Such uses do not
include structures such as cabins, sheds, pavilions, garages,
dwellings or similar structures.
F. Disturbance of the riparian buffer shall be limited to the area necessary
to perform an allowable use.
G. Where possible and practical, disturbances shall be phased, with each
phase restored prior to beginning the next phase.
H. Allowable activities shall not cause stormwater flow to concentrate.
I. Any vegetation removed for an allowable activity shall be replaced
immediately upon completion of the activity. Where mature trees are
removed, such trees shall be replaced with the largest practical tree of
acceptable native species.

maintained during construction. Evidence of an approved erosion and
sediment control plan and/or NPDES permit, if required, shall be
submitted prior to issuance of local permits.
K. If a permit from PADEP is required for the activity, evidence of an
approved permit shall be submitted prior to issuance of local permits.
L. Riparian buffers shall be maintained in a manner consistent with sound
forest management practices. In the absence of a site-specific
management plan, the following maintenance guidelines apply:
(1) Buffers shall be inspected periodically for evidence of excessive
sediment deposition, erosion or concentrated flow channels.

For all riparian buffers, an easement shall be provided. Easements shall be
in accordance with § 274-31 and recorded in accordance with § 274-48 of
this chapter.
Prompt action shall be taken to correct these problems and prevent
future occurrence.
(2) Trees presenting an unusual hazard of creating downstream
obstructions shall be removed. Such material shall be removed
from the floodplain or the riparian buffer (whichever is widest) or
cut into sections small enough so as to prevent the possibility of
creating obstructions downstream. Wherever possible, large stable
debris should be conserved.
(3) Vegetation should be inspected periodically to ensure diverse
vegetative cover and vigorous plant growth consistent with
buffering objectives.
(a) Invasive plant species that may threaten the integrity of the
buffer shall be removed.

ARTICLE VII
Design Criteria
§ 274-21. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless: a) the watersheds are subwatersheds of a common
watershed which join together within the perimeter of the
property; b) the effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate
discharged onto adjacent lands; or c) easements from the affected
landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
(3) Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, dry wells, cisterns, recreation
area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding
tanks, infiltration systems, in-line storage in storm sewers, and
grading patterns). They shall be located, designed and constructed
in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by
PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering
plans and performance capabilities and supporting site-specific
soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to
verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources
may be accepted at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer. A
preapplication meeting is suggested.
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
municipality shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the Venango County Act 167 Stormwater Management
Plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities is strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
§ 274-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-21
1:417
etc. Consultation with the City of Oil City and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility or
swale shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway
unless specifically permitted.
(2) The top, or toe, of any slope shall be located a minimum of 10 feet
from any property line.
(3) The minimum horizontal distance between any structure and any
stormwater storage facility, such as a basin, shall be 25 feet. The
lowest floor elevation of any structure constructed immediately
adjacent to a detention basin or other stormwater facility shall be a
minimum of two feet above the one-hundred-year water surface
elevation.
(4) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of permanent
pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent floodplain
elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no floodplain is defined,
bottom elevations must be greater than existing ground elevations
50 feet from top of stream bank in the facility's vicinity.
(5) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-year
floodplain elevation must be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodplain is not
designated or no other evidence is provided.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high-groundwater table.
§ 274-21 OIL CITY CODE § 274-21
1:418
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
subsurface drainage or hydrostatic provisions are provided.
(7) Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(8) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed 3:1 and must be
further reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.
(9) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed 3:1.
(10) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, all
stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of
1% extending radially out from the principal outlet structure.
Facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs may have a
bottom slope of zero.
(11) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities.
(12) Unless specifically designed as a Volume Control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests
performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom
depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-toempty
calculations if infiltration is a factor.
(13) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Discharges to drainage swales shall be dissipated, or piped, to an
acceptable point.
(14) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(a) Minimal maintenance saturation-tolerant vegetation must be
provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(15) A safety fence may be required, at the discretion of the
municipality, for any stormwater management facility. The fence
shall be a minimum of four feet high and of a material acceptable to
the municipality. A gate with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be
provided for maintenance access.
(16) Principal outlet structures. The primary outlet structure shall be
designed to pass all design storms (up to and including the onehundred-
year event) without discharging through the emergency
spillway. All principal outlet structures shall:
§ 274-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-21
1:419
(a) Be constructed of reinforced concrete or an alternative
material approved by the Municipal Engineer. When approved
for use, all metal risers shall:
[1] Be suitably coated to prevent corrosion.
[2] Have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be of sufficient weight to
prevent flotation of the riser.
[3] Provide a trash rack or similar appurtenance to prevent
debris from entering the riser.
[4] Provide an antivortex device, consisting of a thin vertical
plate normal to the basin berm.
(b) Provide trash racks to prevent clogging of primary outflow
structure stages for all orifices equivalent to 12 inches or
smaller in diameter.
(c) Provide outlet aprons and extend to the toe of the basin slope
at a minimum.
(17) Emergency spillways. Any stormwater management facility
designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year post-development peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:

1:422
(d) A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in
all roadway systems (public or private) proposed for
construction in the municipality. Pipes shall be designed to
provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second when

§ 274-21 OIL CITY CODE § 274-21
1:424
§ 274-22. Calculation methodology.
swales. Documentation must be provided to support velocity
and/or shear limitations used in calculations.
(e) Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or shear
stresses shall be multiplied by the following factor for the
purpose of designing swale erosion protection:

[2] When swale bend is 60° to 90°: 2.00.
[3] When swale bend is 90° or greater: 2.50.
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Methods shall be selected by the design professional based on the
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in conjunction
with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be consistent with the
following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.05
2 2.45
10 3.44
25 4.07
50 4.58
100 5.12
D. Runoff volume.
§ 274-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-22
1:425
(1) Rational Method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is NOT
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more then one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing is unacceptable.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's TR-55 - limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-HMS - no size limitations.
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Municipal Engineer.
(b) The NRCS Antecedent Runoff Condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to 1/10 of
a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).92
(2) NRCS rainfall-runoff method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C). Curve
numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in hydrologic
models as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to the nearest
whole number.
92.Editor's Note: Appendix C is attached to this chapter.
§ 274-22 OIL CITY CODE § 274-22
1:426
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundredyear
hydrographs through the facility using the Storage Indication
Method or Modified Puls Method. The design storm hydrograph
shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(3) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Municipal
Engineer:
(a) Predevelopment - NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = (Tlag.6) * 60] (minutes).
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by:
S = [(1000/CN) - 10]
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed
§ 274-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 274-22
1:427
(b) Post-development; commercial, industrial or other areas with
large impervious areas (>20% impervious area) - NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's equation.
(c) Post-development; residential, cluster or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area - NRCS Lag
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater that the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed,
including when swales are designed to reduce flow velocities.
In the event the post-development Tc is greater than the
predevelopment, it shall be set equal to the predevelopment Tc
for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
post-development watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc can not be assumed
for predevelopment.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the postdevelopment
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
J. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes and storm sewers. The Manning equation should not be
used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PennDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet control shall be checked at all
inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design
event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
§ 274-22 OIL CITY CODE § 274-22
1:428
K. The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
L. The municipality has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of the
Municipal Engineer.

than transitory. Domicile is the place in which a man has voluntarily fixed
the habitation of himself and his family, not for a mere special or limited
purpose but with the present intention of making a permanent home, until
some event occurs to induce him to adopt some other permanent home.
In the case of businesses or associations, the "domicile" is that place
considered as the center of business affairs and the place where its
functions are discharged.
EARNED INCOME  Salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive
payments, fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or his
personal representative for services rendered, whether directly or through
an agent and whether in cash or in property; not including, however,
wages or compensation paid to persons on active military service, periodic
payments for sickness and disability, other than regular wages received
during a period of sickness, disability or retirement, or payments arising
under workers' compensation acts, occupational disease acts and similar
legislation or payments commonly recognized as "old age benefits,"
"retirement pay" or "pensions" paid to persons retired from service after
reaching a specific age or after a stated period of employment, or payments
commonly known as "public assistance" or "unemployment compensation
payments" made by any governmental agency or payments to reimburse
expenses or payments made by employers or labor unions for wage and
salary supplemental programs, including but not limited to programs
covering hospitalization, sickness, disability or death, supplemental
unemployment benefits, strike benefits, social security and retirement.
§ 285-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 285-1
1:465
EMPLOYER  A person, partnership, association, corporation, institution,
governmental body or unit or agency, or any other entity employing one or
more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.

private agency designated by the governing body to collect and administer
the tax on earned income and net profits.
NET PROFITS  The net income from the operation of a business,
profession or other activity, except corporations, after provision for all costs
and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash
or accrual basis in accordance with the accounting system used in such
business, profession or other activity, but without deduction of taxes based
on income.
NONRESIDENT  A person, partnership, association or other entity
domiciled outside the taxing district.

The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,

other political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or

is made within one year from the date of condemnation.

under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend

(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration

cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and

spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.

may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the
reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company and, of itself or together
with prior changes, has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition

subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year

Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political

that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).

from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the

of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption

withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax. However, in
accordance with § 285-108, employers shall furnish to the City or
its Collector, at its request, any payroll records that can
demonstrate compliance with this article.

the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for
him within the political subdivision and making a return and payment
thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to
deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said
employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all
such services are performed within the political subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods

§ 285-103. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes

to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.

paragraph, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the City of Oil City if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 285-100B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 285-105. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the City of Oil City shall be required to comply with this
article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 285-106. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more
than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim
to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
§ 285-107. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of
any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the City of
Oil City do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves
to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this article
with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the City of
Oil City. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the City of
Oil City and an employee of a nonresident employer may, for the purpose of

hereinafter provided.

dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year
declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima
facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

improvement separately for the purpose of calculating the amount of
assessment eligible for tax exemption in accordance with the limits
established in this article. The City will then obtain from the County
Assessor the amount of the assessment eligible for exemption and will
then notify the taxpayer. The City Treasurer shall keep a separate list of
all such exempted properties, and upon receipt of the assessments for
each property from the Bureau of Code and Zoning, the City Treasurer
shall see to it that each such exempted property is credited with its
proper exemption as against the County Assessment figure.
C. The cost of residential improvement or construction, per dwelling unit
of residential properties to be exempted, and the schedule of taxes
exempted existing at the time of the initial request for tax exemption
shall be applicable to that exemption request, and subsequent

Water Service
§ 303-3. City to supply water.
§ 303-4. Service to properties beyond City limits.
The City currently serves some properties situate beyond the limits of the
City. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the City to
continue such service, and it may, subject to the laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, discontinue such service at any time.
§ 303-5. Rules and regulations.
The water service supplied by the City of Oil City shall be provided to
such persons, firms and corporations, subject to the following rules and
regulations:
A. The City of Oil City shall have the exclusive right, at all times, to supply
the City, and such persons, firms or corporations therein as may desire
the same, with water. All occupied buildings in the City of Oil City shall
be connected to the City water supply system, and no other piped or onsite
supply of water to such occupied buildings shall be allowed to be
used for drinking or bathing purposes. Any building not so connected at
the time of this chapter shall be so connected immediately unless a
written waiver is granted by the City.
B. The City shall have the authority to enter upon or into any building or
premises where City water is supplied and billed at all reasonable times
for the purpose of inspection of pipes and fixtures; setting, testing,
repairing, replacing or reading meters; turning water off or on; and
enforcing rules generally. If such building or premises is occupied, the
City employee shall present credentials to the occupant and request
entry. If such building or premises is unoccupied, the City employee
shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person
having charge or control of the building or premises and request entry.
If entry is refused, the City shall have recourse to every remedy
provided by law to secure entry. When the City employee shall have first
obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law
to secure entry, no owner or occupant or person having charge, care or
control of any building or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper
request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by
the City employee for the purpose of inspection and examination
pursuant to this chapter. In addition, each and every refusal of the
City's right to enter a building or premises will render the offending
party liable to penalties prescribed for violation of the rules as further
described herein.
A. Service taps.
§ 303-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-5
1:571
(1) A separate tap to the City of Oil City water main shall be made for
each customer to which water may be furnished by the City. Such
tap from the City main to the curb stop shall be made only by the
proper officers and employees of the City or under its immediate
direction, supervision and control at the cost and expense of the
owner of the property being served.
(2) There are existing service taps in the City which serve more than
one customer. Whenever such customer replaces his portion of a
service line, separate taps and service lines will be made by the
City to serve each customer. In such cases, each property owner
served shall be solely responsible for all costs associated with the
installation of a separate service line to his premises but shall not
be obligated to pay a tap fee for such separate tap. Any property
owner not conforming to this requirement may have his water
service terminated by the City until compliance is achieved.
B. Service lines.
(1) The service lines from the curb stop to the meter shall be installed
and maintained in satisfactory condition at the cost and expense of
the owner of the property to be served. Such lines shall be not less
than 3/4 inch in diameter. Water service pipe shall be rated for 200
psi (pounds per square inch) minimum pressure and shall be made
of Type K copper or copper alloy tubing, or polyethylene (PE)
plastic tubing (outside diameter must be the same as copper tubing
size), in accordance with the requirements of the Plumbing Code of
the City of Oil City, as adopted and readopted by the City from time
to time, and shall also conform to the American Waterworks
Standard Specifications for potable water service, as applicable.
For polyethylene (PE) water service pipe, stainless steel stiffeners
must be used at all fittings and connections, and a tracer wire made
for the purpose of locating underground pipes shall be installed
over and along the service pipe and shall be connected to water
system components capable of conducting electricity at either end.
Water service pipe and tracer wire shall be installed and connected
to the satisfaction of the City. [Amended 8-9-2012 by Ord. No.
2812]
(2) There shall be no physical connection between the City water
supply and any private or on-site water supply, and each system
shall be entirely independent of the other.
(3) Customer service lines shall be maintained in satisfactory
condition. Whenever it is determined that a leak exists through a
service line for which the property owner is responsible, the
property owner shall have such leak repaired immediately at his
cost and expense. If the City determines that the leak is causing a
great loss of water or other problem, the City may, at its sole
discretion, turn the water off immediately. If the City determines
that a leak exists, it will notify the property owner, giving said
§ 303-5 OIL CITY CODE § 303-5
1:572
owner 10 days to repair the leak. If the property owner fails to
repair the leak within the ten-day period, the City reserves the
right to discontinue water service (if it has not already been
discontinued) to the premises until such leak has been repaired.
In such cases, the property owner will be responsible for any turnon
fee which may be required to continue water service unless
the turn-on is accomplished during working hours of the Water
Distribution Department.
C. Installation of service lines.
(1) It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property being
served by the water service line to notify the City and to secure the
necessary permit(s) from the City's Code Enforcement Office when
a water service line will be replaced or repaired and for ensuring
all installation work is done in a workmanlike manner. Any
damages to City facilities shall be promptly reported to the City.
The City shall then repair such facilities at the sole cost and
expense of the persons or firms causing the damage or of the
property owner of the premises being served if compensation
cannot be collected from the persons of firms causing the damage.
Any damages to other than City facilities shall be promptly
reported to the owner of those facilities.
(2) The City reserves the exclusive right to operate curb valves and all
other water system facilities. Persons or firms desiring to turn curb
valves off or on must have prior permission from the Water
Distribution Foreman. Anyone in noncompliance with this provision
shall be subject to penalties as designated in the City's Plumbing
Code.132
(3) Connection of an old service line to the City's curb valve shall be
the responsibility of the property owner of the premises being
served and shall be done only by a plumber who is preapproved by
the City of Oil City. The City's Code Enforcement Office shall
maintain a list of approved plumbers allowed to do such work. Any
person or firm performing such connection work who does not
obtain the proper preapproval shall be subject to penalties as
designated in the City's Plumbing Code.133 The City shall connect
new service pipes to the curb valves, as long as all requirements of
the Distribution Department are met; this will be done at no charge
during normal working hours of the Water Distribution
Department, but a fee will be charged to the property owner for
work performed during other times.
(4) Water service pipe shall be installed in a trench of sufficient depth
to provide not less than four feet of cover over the pipe. The pipe
shall be installed and the trench kept open until the line has been

inspected and approved by the City. At least a six-inch cushion shall
be provided between the pipe and any rock in the bottom of the
trench. Backfill shall be carefully placed and tamped under and
around the pipe with no voids under the pipe. The backfill shall
be placed and tamped in six-inch layers for a depth of not less
than one foot over the pipe. The remaining earth may be bulldozed,
except that no large stones shall be placed in the trench. All
backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable
or organic material, boulders, rocks or stones or other material
which, in the opinion of the City, is unsuitable. Service lines shall
be installed in a straight line, if possible. Thrust blocks shall be
installed in all lines over two inches in diameter whenever there is
a change in size or direction of the line.
(5) The water service pipe shall be placed at least 10 feet horizontally
from any building drain or building sewer, except that, only as a
last resort and at the sole discretion of the City, it may be placed in
the same trench with the building drain or sewer when the
following conditions are met:
(a) The water service pipe is placed on a solid shelf excavated on
one side of the common trench.
(b) The elevation of the bottom of the water service pipe is at least
18 inches above the top of the building drain or building sewer.
(c) The materials and joints of sewer and water service pipe are
installed in such manner and possess the necessary strength
and durability to prevent the escape of solids, liquids and gases
therefrom under all known adverse conditions, such as
corrosion, strains due to temperature change, settlements,
vibrations and superimposed loads.
(6) Service lines shall be installed within a sleeve through the building
wall, which sleeve shall be at least two inches larger in diameter
than the service line pipe diameter. After the service pipe is
installed through such sleeve, the space around the service pipe
shall be sealed with nonshrink grout or other such material to
properly seal the opening.
D. Removal of service lines. When one curb stop serves more than one
premises, and one or more of the premises is being demolished, it shall
be the responsibility of the owner of property being demolished to cut
off and cap his water service line at the point where this line is
separated from the service line that serves the other premises. The cap
shall be placed on the fitting that is used to separate the service lines.
E. Meters.
(1) All water services supplied by the City system shall be metered,
except that lines in place solely for fire protection are not required
to be metered; such fire lines shall be equipped with a three-
§ 303-5 OIL CITY CODE § 303-5
1:574
fourths-inch bypass line on which the City shall install a water
meter to detect water flow through the line. The customer shall
be responsible for the plumbing of the bypass line, which shall
meet the requirements of Figure 2,134 attached as part of this
chapter. The City shall allow more than one meter to serve a single
premises, provided that there is a sufficient reason for multiple
meters, in the sole opinion of the City.
(2) The City initiated a City-wide meter replacement program in 1996.
Water meters replaced under this program are owned by the City of
Oil City, and the City shall be responsible for all testing,
maintenance and replacement of these meters from the date of
installation of the new meter.
(3) No person shall be allowed to remove a meter from the service line
or tamper with a meter in any way; if the City has reason to believe
meter removal or tampering has taken place, the property owner of
the premises served shall be subject to penalties as prescribed
herein.
(4) Property owners are responsible for all other plumbing, including
the piping up to the connections on either side of the meter. The
City is responsible for the meter connections. Whenever plumbing
near or around the water meter is replaced or the water service
line is replaced, the new plumbing shall meet the requirements of
the applicable standard meter setting, attached as Figures 1-1 and
1-2 to this chapter.135 [Amended 8-9-2012 by Ord. No. 2812]
(5) All water meters shall be of a make, design and size approved by
the City and shall be located as approved by the City. Water meters
shall be located either in an approved pit located outside the
building or within the building being serviced as per the
requirements outlined in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, as applicable.136
(6) Property owners shall be responsible for ensuring that the meter
and interior plumbing are protected from freezing and that the
meter is kept safe from damage. If a meter becomes frozen or is
damaged in any way, the property owner shall be liable for the
City's costs associated with repairing or replacing the meter.
Property owners are also responsible to notify the City immediately
if a water meter becomes frozen or is damaged in any way. Failure
to do so may result in penalties as prescribed herein being imposed
on the property owner.
(7) Such water meter shall be so located on the premises as to afford
convenient access thereto to the proper officers and employees of
the City.

the immediate vicinity of the street or utility right-of-way and shall
be constructed and maintained by the property owner at his
expense. Meter pit locations must be approved by the City prior to
construction.
(2) Meter pits shall at all times be free of debris and other foreign
matter so that the City shall have unobstructed access to the meter.
(3) All meter pits shall be constructed under the supervision and
inspection of the proper officials of the City. The meter pit shall be
constructed of concrete, brick, steel or of vitrified clay or concrete
pipe or of other material approved by the City and of such a size
and shape to provide for the installation of the meter and shutoff
valves and bypass and appurtenances when required and be of
sufficient depth to provide at least four feet of cover over the pipe.
The meter pit shalt be constructed to provide maximum frost
protection and shall be provided with a drain pipe, drainage pit or
constructed watertight, as required by the City.

adversely affect the performance of the service line.
(c) When a suitable place is not available in the building being
serviced for the location of the meter.

connection fee for a new street service connection to such premises
and for water service to begin immediately following installation of
the street service connection.
§ 303-5 OIL CITY CODE § 303-5
1:576
§ 303-6. Water charged to owner of property served.
All charges for water furnished by the City of Oil City shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property which is served by the City with
water at the rate hereinafter fixed; exceptions to this rule are outlined in
Article III herein.
§ 303-7. Reading of meters.
All water meters shall be read by the City monthly, ice and snow permitting,
and bills shall be rendered by the City to the property owners within said
month for the amount of water shown to have been consumed during said
period in accordance with the schedule of rates hereinafter fixed. If an
active meter is found stationary for any meter reading period, the bill for
such period shall be estimated on an equitable basis having regard to
previous readings for similar periods.
STREET SERVICE CONNECTION  A pipe with appurtenances
used to conduct water from a distribution main of the City to the
curbline of the premises.
(2) The City of Oil City will extend existing distribution mains within
public right-of-way in the City of Oil City a distance of 55 feet in
length for each bona fide prospective customer not presently
served by water and making application for water service under
these rules and regulations. Such extensions will be made without
costs to such customer(s).
(3) When an extension greater than 55 feet in length for each bona fide
prospective customer is required, such extension will be made
under the terms of an extension deposit agreement, which shall be
in accordance with the current policies in effect at the time of the
application for water service. The City shall have the exclusive
right to determine the type and size of mains to be installed and the
other facilities required to render adequate service; provided,
however, that where the City decides to install a main larger than
eight inches in diameter and an eight-inch main would render
adequate service throughout the extension, the City will bear the
difference in material cost between a pipe larger than eight inches
and an eight-inch pipe.
(4) In determining the length of and necessity for any extension
required pursuant hereto, the terminal point of such extension
shall, in all cases, be at that point in the curbline which is
equidistant from the side property lines of the last lot for which
water service is requested, and a street service connection will be
provided only for customer service lines from the curb to the
premises to be served which are laid in a straight tine at right
angles to the curbline.

district boundary by such center lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on
the Zoning Map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line,
he shall refuse action, and the Zoning Hearing Board, upon appeal, shall
interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of

1:617
A. The criteria for conditional uses and special exceptions are listed below.
In addition to these, the Zoning Hearing Board, in granting special
exceptions, and the City Council/Planning Commission, in considering
conditional uses, is charged with considering the effect that such
proposed uses will have upon the immediate neighborhood. The
preservation and integrity of existing development must be carefully
weighed and given priority in each decision. In granting a special
exception or conditional use, the Board or Council (as appropriate) may
attach reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code and this
chapter. Some permitted uses may have standards attached. They will
be permitted or denied based upon the criteria set forth by this chapter;
however, the Zoning Officer does not have the power to impose any
additional conditions.
(1) Forestry. The practice of forestry, including timber harvesting, is
declared as a permitted use in all districts. It is subject to the
following condition: To avoid traffic congestion and sound
disturbance, all activities must start at 7:00 a.m. and end by 8:00

approval.
(3) Public utility substations:
(a) Shall be landscaped and screened with evergreen plantings to
present a minimum intrusion upon the neighborhood.

1:618
height of this fence shall be adequate to provide proper
security for the installation.
(c) No outdoor storage shall be permitted.
(4) Cemeteries. Prior to the establishment of a new cemetery or the

ARTICLE IV
Supplementary Regulations
§ 310-17. Nonconforming uses and structures.
The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and
structures. It is the intention of the City of Oil City that all legal
nonconforming uses and structures shall be able to continue; however, all
changes in such uses shall only be as allowed in this article.
A. Any nonconforming use may be continued or may be changed to a use of
the same or a more restrictive classification. The nonconforming use
may not be extended or expanded unless to a conforming use, except as
permitted by the Board in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
B. Any nonconforming structure or building or sign which has been
damaged or destroyed by fire or any other means may be reconstructed
and used as before, if such reconstruction is performed within one year
of discontinuance of use and if the restored building covers no greater
area and contains no greater cubic content. If approved by the Board, a
reconstructed structure or building may exceed its original lot coverage
and cubic content but must meet the minimum yard requirements of the
district in which the structure is located, and it must meet the off-street
parking and loading requirements of this chapter.
C. In the event that any nonconforming use, conducted in a structure or
otherwise, ceases for whatever reasons for a period of one year, such
nonconforming use shall not be resumed, and any further use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
D. The nonconforming use of a structure or building may be extended
throughout those parts which were arranged or designed for such use
at the time of adoption of this chapter. A nonconforming building or
structure may, with the approval of the Board, be extended, enlarged or
replaced if such expansion does not occupy an area greater than 50%
more than the structure occupied prior to such expansion, enlargement
or reconstruction. Furthermore, such activities must meet the minimum
yard regulations and height restrictions of the district and all off-street
parking and loading requirements.
E. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout,
plans, construction, size or designated use of any development,
building, structure or part thereof for which official approval and
required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this
chapter and where construction is complete within six months from the
date of issuance of the permit.
F. Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be
permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.

1:639
§ 310-18. Existing lots of record.
§ 310-19. Application of yard regulations.
G. Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer
an area from one district to another of a different classification, this
article shall also apply to any uses or structures which thereby become
nonconforming.
A. Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this chapter and held
in separate ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots
may be used for the erection of a structure conforming to the use
regulations of the district in which it is located even though its lot area
and width are less than the minimum required by this chapter.
However, such lot must comply with the yard, height and coverage
standards of the zoning district wherein it is located. Any multifamily
use must meet the appropriate density standards of the zoning district.
Where two or more adjacent lots of record with less than the required
area and width are held by one owner on or before the date of
enactment of this chapter, the request for a permit shall be referred to
the Zoning Hearing Board, which may require replatting to fewer lots
which would comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter.
B. The size of any existing lot of record shall not be reduced so that the
area or dimensions of the lot are smaller than those required by this
chapter.
A. Where a structure exists on an adjacent lot and is within 150 feet of the
proposed structure, and the existing structure has a front yard less than
the minimum depth required, the minimum front yard shall be the
average depth of the front yard of the existing structure on the adjacent
lot and the minimum depth required for the district; where structures
exist on both adjacent lots, the minimum depth of the front yard shall be
the average depth of the front yards of the existing adjacent structures.
B. All structures, whether attached to the principal structure or not, and
whether open or enclosed, including porches, carports, balconies or
platforms above normal grade level, shall not project into any minimum
front, side or rear yards except as noted in this subsection, Subsection
C or D. Overhangs of up to 18 inches will be allowed (see illustration).

(1) Size and access. Each off-street loading space shall be not less than
10 feet in uniform width and 40 feet in length. It shall be so
designed so the vehicles using loading spaces are not required to
back onto a public street or alley. Such spaces shall abut a public
street or alley or have an easement of access thereto.
B. Off-street parking.
(1) Size and access. Each off-street parking space shall have an area of
not less than 162 square feet, being at least 18 feet long with a
uniform width of nine feet, exclusive of access drives or aisles, and
shall be in usable shape and condition. Except in the case of a
single-family dwelling, no parking area shall contain less than three
spaces. Parking areas shall be designed to provide sufficient
turnaround area so that vehicles are not required to back onto
public streets. Where an existing lot does not abut on a public or
private street, alley or easement of access, there shall be provided
an access drive leading to the parking or storage areas or loading
spaces. Such access drive shall not be less than 10 feet wide.
Access to off-street parking areas shall be limited to well-defined
locations, and in no case shall there be unrestricted access along a
street. Specifically, single-lane driveways shall be at least 10 feet
wide but shall not exceed 12 feet in width; double drives (for

least five feet between a driveway and a fire hydrant, catch basin or
street intersection radius.
(2) Parking within yards.
(a) In residential districts or in other districts where the primary
use of the property is for residential purposes, parking areas
shall only be permitted in the rear or side yards or in driveway
areas in the front yard that are constructed in accordance with
§ 310-23B(7). No motor vehicle may be parked upon any
premises zoned for residential use unless within a garage or
upon a concrete, paved or compacted, crushed stone driveway
leading directly from the street. The entrance to the driveway
from the street shall only be allowed where a local or state
curb cut permit has been approved. In no case will parking be
allowed upon any unimproved surface. As used in this section,
the term "unimproved surface" includes, but is not limited to,
grass and dirt surfaces. In other districts where the primary
§ 310-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-23
1:645
use of the property is either for commercial or industrial
permitted uses, parking shall also be allowed in the front yard
subject to § 310-23B(5).
(b) Notwithstanding the above, should the configuration of the
existing lot and improvements constructed thereon not allow
any option for off-street parking, property owners may request
a variance from the Zoning Hearing Board to construct an offstreet
parking area in the front yard. In addition to the
stipulations contained in § 310-45I, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall take the following into account when reviewing requests
for variances under this section:
[1] Whether there are any options for parking elsewhere on
property owned by the applicant;
[2] The general availability of on-street parking in the
neighborhood; and
[3] Any hazardous traffic condition that may result if a
variance is approved.
(c) If a hardship-based variance is approved, the front yard
parking area shall meet all the requirements stated above
regarding curb cuts and surface materials. Minimum width and
depth of the surface shall be nine feet and 18 feet, respectively,
and shall be constructed perpendicular to the adjoining street.
At no time shall the parking area be constructed in a position
whereby it is situated directly parallel with the front of any
portion of the primary residence located on the lot.
(3) Number of parking spaces required. The number of off-street
parking spaces required is set forth below. Where the use of the
premises is not specifically mentioned, requirements for similar
uses shall apply. If no similar uses are mentioned, the parking
requirements shall be one space for each two proposed patrons
and/or occupants of that structure. Where more than one use exists
on a lot, parking regulations for each use must be met. No parking
shall be required of existing or future uses in the C-2 Downtown
Commercial District except as required in § 310-16.

strip of at least five feet between the front lot line and the parking
lot. Such planting strip shall be suitably landscaped and
maintained.
(6) Minimum distance and setbacks. No off-street loading or parking
area for more than five vehicles shall be closer than five feet to any
adjoining property line containing a dwelling, residential district,
school, hospital or similar institution.

have a concrete, paved or a compacted crushed stone (six inches'
minimum depth) surface, graded with positive drainage to dispose
of surface water. If the installed surface is compacted crushed
stone, the surface shall have a topcoat of crushed stone, crushed
brick or washed gravel not to exceed 1 1/2 inches. The edges of the
driveway shall be delineated by a stone, brick or timber border that
is structurally sufficient to confine the stone to the driveway area.
In addition, at no time should the crushed stone show weeds or
grass growing through the surface. Parking areas larger than
10,000 square feet shall submit a plan, including drainage
provisions, to the City for approval. Lots shall be designated to
provide for orderly and safe loading and parking.
(8) Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking or
loading areas shall be arranged so as to reflect the light away from
the adjoining premises of any residential district or use and away
from roads or highways.

used in said vocational or avocational pursuits; providing, however,
that truck-tractor and/or semitrailers shall not be parked in the
open air any closer than 150 feet from the nearest residence on a
neighboring property.
(10) Outdoor storage of utility or cargo trailers. There shall be no
permanent outdoor storage of utility or cargo trailers in any
district, except for temporary periods to afford the loading and
unloading of these trailers in commercial or industrial districts.
"Temporary" shall be defined for purposes of this section to mean
for a period not to exceed seven days. A special permit may be
granted by the Zoning Officer for longer periods not to exceed 30
days in length. At no time shall these types of trailers be allowed to
remain in any district as long-term or permanent storage facilities.
(11) Outdoor storage of recreation vehicles, watercraft and trailers. All
types of licensed and unlicensed camping or hauling trailers of any
variety, all outboard and inboard motorboats, and all self-contained
recreation vehicles or motor homes shall only be parked in the rear
half or portion of a lot according to the original recorded depth of
the lot. In no case shall any such vehicle or vessel described above
be located or parked for any period of time in the front half 50% of
the lot.
(12) Portable storage units. These units are intended for the temporary
storage of household goods during moving or remodeling. Units
must be off the public right-of-way and set back at least 15 feet. The
use of trailers, either former mobile homes or semi-rigs, for storage
is not permitted in any district in the City. The City shall issue
permits for such units on a thirty-day basis with up to one thirty-day
renewal. After that time, the units will be regarded as structures.
They shall be placed on a permanent foundation, shall meet all yard

B. Have permanent approved hookups to sanitary sewer and water.
C. Unit shall be permanently installed and meet all local and state building
codes.
D. There shall be no trailer hitch attached to the mobile home once
installation is completed.
A. Specific intent. It is the finding of the City that, from time to time,
various structures located throughout the City become abandoned,
surplus or obsolete by virtue of the fact that such structures cannot be
economically utilized for their previous use. In addition to the general
goals stated in this chapter, the purpose of the section is to allow for
residential reuse of those obsolete, surplus or abandoned structures.
The adaptive reuse will deter or prevent the deterioration of the stable
neighborhood by permitting the reuse of obsolete, surplus or
abandoned structures, by preventing such structures from becoming
substandard or dilapidated and thus a hazard or danger to the
community. In addition, the adaptive reuse will promote the positive
aspects of a neighborhood by supplementing the housing requirements
of its residents and will generally increase the tax base of the City.
B. Designation of project.
(1) An owner or developer of any commercial, industrial, public or
quasi-public structure that has become abandoned, surplus or
obsolete may submit an application to the Zoning Hearing Board
for a permit granting an adaptive reuse to convert said structure to
a multifamily residential complex consisting of at least five units.
§ 310-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-29
1:655
(2) The adaptive reuse of said structure may be accomplished in
residential, commercial and industrial districts. In all cases,
regardless of the district, the area and bulk regulations of the R-2
District shall apply, subject to the power and authority of the
Zoning Hearing Board to grant or refuse further variance
thereunder.
C. Procedure.
(1) If the owner or developer of an obsolete, surplus or abandoned
structure that is or was being used for commercial, industrial,
public or quasi-public purposes wishes to convert such structure to
a multifamily residential use, and:
(a) The multifamily residential use is not a use by right in the
particular zone in which it is located; and/or
(b) The conversion of the property to residential multifamily use
will not meet all the area and bulk requirements for apartment
units as required by the R-2 District and area and bulk
regulations of this chapter, then the owner or developer of the
property shall file a written application to the Zoning Hearing
Board, which application shall include:
[1] A legal description or sketch of the property which is the
subject of the adaptive reuse; and
[2] A statement of the current zoning use and/or area and bulk
regulations which cannot be met for the proposed
multifamily residential project; and
[3] A statement of the manner in which the proposed project
meets the intent of this section.
(2) The City Planning Commission shall have the opportunity to review
the application and shall have a thirty-day period from the date of
filing of said application to make recommendations to the Zoning
Hearing Board regarding the proposed project.
D. Permit granting for adaptive reuse use standards. The Board shall grant
or refuse the permit for the adaptive reuse under the following
conditions:
(1) The proposed change will not substantially injure or detract from
the use of neighborhood property or from the character of the
neighborhood and that the use of property adjacent to the area
included in the proposed project is adequately safeguarded.
(2) The proposed change will serve the best interests of Oil City, the
convenience of the community and the public welfare.
(3) The effect of the proposed project upon the efficient and
economical extension of public services and facilities, such as
§ 310-29 OIL CITY CODE § 310-29
1:656
§ 310-30. Storage.
In commercial and industrial districts all storage shall be completely
screened from view from any public right-of-way and any residential district
that abuts the district. Screening shall consist of evergreen planting or an
architectural screen. All organic rubbish or storage shall be contained in
airtight, vermin-proof containers that shall also be screened from view from
any public right-of-way, business or abutting residential district.
§ 310-31. Lighting.
Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking or loading areas shall be
arranged so as to reflect the light away from the adjoining premises of any
residential district or use and away from roads or highways. Fully shielded
fixtures are required.
§ 310-32. Clothes lines.
The use of clothes lines shall be permitted in residential districts only.
However, this use shall be limited to the side and rear yards of the
residential property. No clothes lines shall be permitted to be installed in
public water, sewers, police and fire protection, and public schools,
will be minimal.
(4) The proposed project assures the harmonious design of buildings;
planting and maintenance as a sight or sound screen; the
minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous elements; adequate
standards of parking and sanitation.
(5) The proposed project is suitable with respect to the probable
effects upon area traffic and access situations.
E. Area and bulk standards. Since the end use for any project being
considered under this section is multifamily residential, the area and
bulk regulations for multifamily apartment units as set forth in the R-2
District shall serve as the standards for the project. In those cases
where the subject property or structure cannot meet these standards,
the Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance(s) from the standards,
if such variance(s) does not injure or materially detract from the use of
the neighboring properties. Any variance(s) granted under this section
shall be the minimum variance(s) necessary to make possible the
reasonable reuse of the abandoned, surplus or obsolete structure.
F. Off-street parking regulations. At least one off-street parking space
shall be required for each dwelling unit; except in the case of housing
for the elderly, at least one parking space for every two dwelling units
shall be required.
G. Additional standards. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the
authority to impose such conditions, in addition to those required, as
are necessary to assure that the intent of this chapter is complied with.
§ 310-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-32
1:657
the front yard area. Clothes lines that were installed prior to the effective
date of this chapter must be relocated to either the side or rear yard areas.

notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of
the parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has
filed a written request to receive enforcement notice regarding the

affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may
institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to
prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation. When any such action is instituted by a
landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be served upon the City
at least 30 days prior to the time the action is begun by serving a copy
of the complaint on the City Council of the City of Oil City. No such
action may be maintained until such notice has been given.
§ 310-34 OIL CITY CODE § 310-35
1:660
§ 310-36. Method of appeal.

$500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred
by the City as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the City may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
Magisterial District Judge determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to
have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date
of the determination of a violation, and thereafter each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments,
costs and reasonable attorney's fees collected for the violation of zoning
ordinances shall be paid over to the City. Nothing contained in this
section shall be construed or interpreted to grant any person or entity
other than the City and its Zoning Officer the right to commence any
action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
A. The Zoning Officer, or designee, charged with the enforcement of this
chapter, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the
duties described in this chapter, shall not be personally liable for any
damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or
by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit
brought against the Zoning Officer or employee in the enforcement of
any provision of such ordinance or other pertinent laws or ordinances
implemented through the enforcement of this chapter or enforced by
the enforcement agency shall be defended by the City until final
termination of the proceedings, and any judgment resulting therefrom
shall be assumed by the City.
B. This chapter shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the
responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any
building or parcel of land for any damages to persons or property
caused by defects, nor shall the enforcement agency of the City be held
§ 310-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-37

as assuming any such liability by reason of the reviews of permits
issued under this chapter.

consent or consent on the record by the applicant and City, be granted
additional hearings to complete their opposition to the application,
provided the applicant is granted an equal number of additional
hearings for rebuttal.
D. The hearings shall be conducted by the Board, or the Board may
appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing officer.
The decision or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall be

final.
E. The parties to the hearing shall be the City, any person affected by the
application who has made timely appearance of record before the
Board, and any other person including civic or community

K. The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing before

based thereon together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on
any provisions of this chapter or the Municipalities Planning Code or
any rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied

complete the required hearing as required by Article IX of the
Municipalities Planning Code, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed
in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision has
been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the
Board to meet or render a decision as herein above provided, the Board
shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days in the same
manner as provided in Section 908(9) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.151 Nothing in this subsection shall

B. Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption,
which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after

from is the initial zoning ordinance of the City and a zoning hearing
board has not been previously established, the appeal raising
procedural questions shall be taken directly to court.
C. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including, but not
limited to, the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act on the
application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist order or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or
lot.

Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance.

I. Variances.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application
and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The
Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the

Appeals under § 310-45 and proceedings to challenge the Zoning Ordinance
under § 310-45 may be filed with the Board, in writing, by the landowner
affected, any officer or agency of the City, or any person aggrieved.

circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located;
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare; and
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purpose of this chapter.
J. Special exceptions.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide requests for such special
exceptions in accordance with the standards and criteria of this
chapter. In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Municipalities Planning Code and the Zoning
Ordinance in this chapter.
(2) When this chapter requires certificates, licenses, permits or similar
documents and when, in the Board's opinion, such documents will
be issued in a matter of time, the Board may issue a conditional
approval based upon the final issuance of such documents.

1:668
§ 310-47. Time limitations; persons aggrieved.
No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later than
30 days after an application for development, preliminary or final, has been
approved by an appropriate City officer, agency or body if such proceeding
is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner, unless
such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded
to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge
of his predecessor in interest. See also Section 914.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code.155
§ 310-48. Stay of proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 913.3 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code156 and during its pendency
before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged
ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body,
and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or
any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating
that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by
a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning
Officer or other appropriate agency or body. See also Section 915.1 of the
Municipalities Planning Code.157
§ 310-49. Conditional uses.
Certain uses, as specified by this chapter, are conditional uses to be granted
or denied by the City Council. The Planning Commission is to advise the
Council relative to conditional uses. In general, the City Council is to be
governed by the specific criteria set forth by this chapter, the general intent
of the ordinance, the welfare of the community and the recommendations
of the Planning Commission in rendering its decision. The City Council may
attach reasonable conditions to its decision. Specific procedures for action
follow:
A. Where the City Council, in this chapter, has stated conditional uses to
be granted or denied by the City Council pursuant to express standards
and criteria, the City Council shall hold hearings on and decide requests
for such conditional uses in accordance with such standards and
criteria. The hearing shall be conducted by the City Council or the
Council may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a
hearing officer. The decision or, where no decision is called for, the
findings shall be made by the City Council. However, the appellant or
the applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the City, may, prior to

the decision of the hearing, waive decision or findings by the Council
and accept the decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
In granting a conditional use, the City may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the
chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Act
and this chapter.
B. Decision or findings.
(1) The City Council shall render a written decision or, when no
decision is called for, make written findings on the conditional use
application within 45 days after the last hearing before the City

decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact or conclusions
based thereon, together with any reasons thereof. Conclusions
based on any provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code or of
any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed
appropriate in the light of the facts found.
(2) Where the City Council fails to render the decision within the
period required by this subsection or fails to commence, conduct or
complete the required hearing as provided in Section 908(1.2) of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, the decision shall
be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless
the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension
of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the
applicant because of the failure of the City Council to meet or
render a decision as herein above provided, the City Council shall
give public notice of the decision within 10 days from the last day it
could have met to render a decision in the same manner as
required by the public notice requirements of this Act. If the City
shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction. A copy of the final decision or, where no
decision is called for, of the findings shall be delivered to the
applicant personally or mailed to him no later than the day
following its date.

ARTICLE VIII
Planned Residential Development
§ 310-56. Planned residential development.
Purpose. The purpose of the planned residential development regulations is
to encourage the flexibility in the design and development of land in order
to promote its most appropriate use; to encourage grouping of housing and
a mixture of housing types in alternative patterns and in a variety of ways;
to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities;
and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. Planned
residential developments are permitted in the R-1 District.
A. Minimum development size. No planned residential development may
include less than five acres of contiguous land.
B. General standards. The planned residential development must meet all
of the following general standards:
(1) The planned residential development is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and this chapter's statement of community
development objectives.
(2) The planned residential development is an effective and unified
treatment of the development possibilities on the project site, and
the development plan makes appropriate provision for the
preservation of streams and stream banks, wetlands, wooded
cover, rough terrain, and similar areas.
(3) The planned residential development shall be planned and
developed to harmonize with any existing or proposed development
in the area surrounding the project site.
(4) Connection to the Oil City sanitary sewer system shall be required.
(5) Connection to the Oil City water system will be required.
C. Applicable districts and uses permitted. Planned residential
developments may be approved in the R-1 Residential District and may
include the following additional uses: multiple-family dwellings and
related uses. Such additional uses shall be allowed only to the extent
that the City finds them to be compatibly and harmoniously
incorporated into the design of the planned development. (Mobile
homes and mobile home parks are excluded from the planned
residential development district.)
D. Calculations of project densities. The number of dwelling units which
may be constructed within the planned residential development shall be
determined by dividing the gross project area by the required lot area
per dwelling unit which is required in the R-1 District.
E. Increase in density. It is recognized that the expense of complying with
the approval process contained in the planned residential development
§ 310-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-56
1:675
regulations may discourage developers from seeking approval of a
planned residential development project. At the time the outline or
preliminary development plan is filed, the applicant may apply for an
increase in the densities permitted by the zone in which the planned
residential development is to be constructed. If it gives its approval to
the planned residential development, the City Council may authorize
the developer to increase permitted densities by an amount up to 10%.
Additional increase in density may be granted up to 27%, providing:
(1) If common open space is developed to more intense usable open
space providing facilities for active outdoor recreation, such as
playgrounds, playground equipment, picnic facilities, ball fields
and equipment, or other similar improvements to the open space,
an additional ten-percent increase in density may be permitted.
(2) If item (1) above is developed and unique indoor-outdoor buildings,
to be used for recreation or other similar activities of the residents
of the development, such as swimming pools, club houses, or other
similar buildings, are provided, then an additional seventeenpercent
increase in density may be permitted.
F. Lot size and spacing of buildings.
(1) The location of all structures shall be as shown on final plans. The
proposed location and arrangement shall not be detrimental to
existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing or
prospective development of the neighborhood. There shall be no
minimum lot size, no minimum or maximum percentage of lot
coverage and no minimum lot width in the planned residential
development. However, every single-family dwelling shall have
access to a public street, court, walkway or other area dedicated to
public use. No dwelling and no addition to any dwellings shall be
erected within a distance of less than the height of the highest
adjacent building.
(2) Vehicular access to dwellings by means of adequate service drives
and/or emergency entrances shall be provided in all cases where
dwellings do not front on a public street or where the City deems
necessary for public safety.
G. Perimeter requirements. The requirements of this section apply only to
structures located within 200 feet of the perimeter of a planned
residential development. If topographical or other barriers do not
provide adequate privacy for existing uses adjacent to the planned
residential development, the Planning Commission may require either
or both of the following:
(1) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential
development must be set back by a distance sufficient to protect
the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses, in no case less
than the height of the buildings.
§ 310-56 OIL CITY CODE § 310-56
1:676
(2) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential
development must be permanently screened in a manner which is
sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing
uses.
H. Common open space required.
(1) The development plan will contain areas to be allocated for
common open space which satisfy the standards governing the
usability and quality of common open space that is contained in this
chapter.
(2) No open area may be accepted as common open space under the
provisions of this chapter unless it meets the following standards:
(a) A minimum of three acres of common open space shall be
provided, including usable and scenic green space for the first
10 acres plus one acre for each additional five acres or fraction
thereof of gross project area.
(b) The location, shape, size and character of the common open
space must be suitable for the planned residential
development.
(c) Common open space must be suitably improved for its
intended use, but common open space containing natural
features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The
building, structures and improvements which are permitted in
the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which
are authorized for the common open space and must conserve
and enhance the amenities of the common open space having
regard to its topography and unimproved condition.
(d) The development schedule which is part of the development
plan must coordinate the improvement of the common open
space, the construction of buildings, structures and
improvements in the common open space, and the construction
of residential dwellings in the planned residential
development.
(e) If the final development plan provides for buildings, structures
and improvements in the common open space of a value in
excess of $10,000, the developer must provide a bond in the
estimated amount of the improvements assuring that the
buildings, structures and improvements will be completed. The
City Council shall release the bond or other assurance when
the buildings, structures or improvements have been
completed according to the development plan.
I. Conveyance and maintenance of common space. All land shown on the
final development plan as common open space must be conveyed under
one of the following options:
§ 310-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-56
1:677
(1) It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to maintain
the common open space and any buildings, structures or
improvements which have been placed on it; in which case the
general public must have use of the open space.
(2) It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture
establishing an association or similar organization for the
maintenance of the planned residential development. The common
open space must be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants
to be approved by the City which restrict the common open space
to the uses specified on the final development plan and which
provide for the maintenance of the common open space in a
manner which assures its continuing use for its intended purpose.
(a) No common open space may be put to any use not specified in
the final development plan unless the final development plan
has been amended to permit that use. However, no change of
use authorized under Subsection C may be considered as a
waiver of any of the covenants limiting the use of common open
space areas, and all rights to enforce these covenants against
any use permitted are expressly reserved.
(b) If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency,
either one of the following methods of enforcement must be
provided:
[1] The legal right to develop the common open space for the
uses not specified in the final development plan must be
approved by the City.
[2] The restrictions governing the use, improvement and
maintenance of the common open space must be stated as
conditions to the conveyance of the common open space;
the fee title to the common open space to vest in a public
agency in the event of a substantial default in the stated
conditions.
(c) If the common open space is not conveyed to the City or a
public agency approved by the City, the covenants governing
the use, improvement and maintenance of the common open
space shall then be enforceable by the City, and the instrument
of conveyance shall so provide.
(d) It is the purpose and intent of these regulations that the City
shall have the authority and powers to require the adequate
maintenance of common open space as set forth by Article VII
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
J. Application for tentative approval of planned residential development.
In order to provide an expeditious method for processing a
development plan for a planned residential development under the
provisions of this chapter, and to avoid the delay and uncertainty which
§ 310-56 OIL CITY CODE § 310-56
1:678
would arise if it were necessary to secure approval by a multiplicity of
procedures of a plat of subdivision as well as approval of a change in

declared to be in the public interest that all procedures with a planned
residential development and the continuing administration thereof shall
utilize the following provisions:

as is specified by the City. The application shall be filed with the
Zoning Officer.
(3) All planning, zoning and subdivision matters relating to the
platting, use and development of the planned residential
development and subsequent modifications of the regulations
relating thereto, to the extent such modification is vested in the
City, shall be determined and established by the City Council with
the advice of the Planning Commission.
(4) The provisions shall require only such information in the
application as is reasonably necessary to disclose to the City of Oil
City:

the landowner's interest in the land proposed to be developed;
(b) The density of land use to be allocated to parts of the site to be

the planned residential development are intended to be filed,
and this schedule must be updated annually, on the
anniversary of its approval, until the development is completed
and accepted.
(5) The application for tentative approval of a planned residential
development shall include a written statement by the landowner
setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, a planned residential
development would be in the public interest and would be
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the
municipality.
(6) The application for tentative approval shall be forwarded to the Oil

approval of a planned residential development pursuant to this
chapter, a public hearing pursuant to public notice of said
application shall be held by the City of Oil City in the manner
prescribed in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(2) The City Council may continue the hearing from time to time and,
where applicable, may refer the matter back to the Planning
Commission for additional review; provided, however, that in any
event the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded within 60
days after the date of the first public hearing.
L. The findings.
(1) Tentative approval.
(a) The City Council, within 60 days following the conclusion of the
public hearing provided for in this part, shall, by official
written communication to the landowner, either:
167. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10704.
§ 310-56 OIL CITY CODE § 310-56
1:680
[1] Grant tentative approval of the development plan as
submitted;
[2] Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions
not included in the development plan as submitted; or
[3] Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
(b) Failure to so act within said period shall be deemed to be a
grant of tentative approval of the development plan as
submitted. In the event, however, the tentative approval is
granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within 30
days after receiving a copy of the official written
communication of the City notify such City Council of his
refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case the City
shall be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the
development plan. In the event the landowner does not, within
said period, notify the governing body of his refusal to accept
all said conditions, tentative approval of the development plan,
with all said conditions, shall stand as granted.
(2) The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings
of fact related to the specific proposal and set forth the reasons for
the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said
communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects
the development plan would or would not be in the public interest,
including, but not limited to, findings of fact and conclusions on the
following:
(a) In those respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of
the City of Oil City;
(b) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject
property, including, but not limited to, density, bulk and use,
and the reason why such departures are or are not deemed to
be in the public interest;
(c) The purpose, location and amount of the common open space
in the planned residential development, the reliability of the
proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common
open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and
purpose of the common open space as related to the proposed
density and type of residential development;
(d) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in
which said design does or does not make adequate provision
for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular
traffic, and further the amenities of light and air, recreation
and visual enjoyment;
§ 310-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-56
1:681
(e) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed
planned residential development to the neighborhood in which
it is proposed to be established; and
(f) In the case of a development plan which proposes development
over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and
conditions intended to protect the interests of the public and of
the residents of the planned residential development in the
integrity of the development plan.
(3) In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with
or without conditions, the City may set forth in the official written
communication the time within which an application for final
approval of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a
development plan which provides for development over a period of
years, the periods of time within which applications for final
approval of each part thereof shall be filed. Except upon the
consent of the landowner, the time so established between grant of
tentative approval and an application for final approval shall not be
less than 12 months and, in the case of developments over a period
of years, the time between applications for final approval of each
part of a plan shall be not less than 12 months.
M. Status of plan after tentative approval.
(1) The official written communication provided for in this part shall be
certified by the City Secretary of the City Council and shall be filed
in his office, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner.
Where tentative approval has been granted, it shall be deemed an
amendment to the Zoning Map, effective upon final approval, and
shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
(2) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of
the planned residential development for recording nor authorize
development or the issuance of any building permits. A
development plan which has been given tentative approval as
submitted, or which has been given tentative approval with
conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and
provided that the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of
the conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or
revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the City pending an
application or applications for final approval without the consent of
the landowner, provided an application or applications for final
approval is filed or, in the case of development over a period of
years, provided that applications are filed within the period of time
specified in the official written communication granting tentative
approval.
(3) In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval
and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect
to abandon said development plan and shall so notify the governing
§ 310-56 OIL CITY CODE § 310-56
1:682
body in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file
application or applications for final approval within the required
period of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval
shall be deemed to be revoked, and all that portion of the area
included in the development plan for which final approval has not
been given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise
applicable thereto, as they may be amended from time to time, and
the same shall be noted on the Zoning Map and in the records of
the City Secretary of the City Council.
N. Application for final approval.
(1) An application for final approval may be for all the land included in
a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative
approval, for a section thereof. Said application shall be made to
the Zoning Officer of the municipality designated by the ordinance
within one year of the official written communication granting
tentative approval. The application shall include any drawings,
specifications, covenants, easements, performance bond, and such
other requirements as may be specified by this chapter, as well as
any conditions set forth in the official written communication at the
time of tentative approval. A public hearing on an application for
final approval of the development plan, or the part thereof
submitted for final approval, shall not be required, provided the
development plan or the part thereof submitted for final approval is
in compliance with the development plan theretofore given
tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached
thereto. The submission shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer
and the Planning Commission for compliance prior to being
forwarded to the City Council. This review is to take place in 35
days.
(2) In the event the application for final approval has been filed,
together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in
support thereof, and as required by the ordinance and the official
written communication of tentative approval, the City shall, within
45 days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
(3) Refusal.
(a) In the event the development plan as submitted contains
variations from the development plan given tentative approval,
the City may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within 45
days from the filing of the application for final approval, so
advise the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in
said notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are
not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the
landowner may either:

[2] File a written request with the approving body that it hold
a public hearing on his application for final approval.
(b) If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he
may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply
for final approval or within 30 additional days if the time for
applying for final approval shall have already passed at the
time when the landowner was advised that the development
plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the
landowner shall fail to take either of these alternative actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the
hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be
conducted in the manner prescribed in this part for public
hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days
after the conclusion of the hearing, the City shall by official
written communication either grant final approval to the
development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of
final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising
under this section, be in the form and contain the findings
required for an application for tentative approval set forth in
this chapter.
(4) A development plan or any part thereof which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the City and shall be
filed of record forthwith in the office of the Recorder of Deeds
before any development shall take place in accordance therewith.
Upon the filing of record of the development plan, the zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in
such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending completion, in
accordance with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,168 of said planned
residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be,
that has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of
said development plan or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be
made except with the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a
final plat, the developer shall record the plat in accordance with the
provisions of Section 513(a) and post financial security in
accordance with Section 509 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.169
(5) In the event that a development plan or a section thereof is given
final approval, and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such
plan or the section thereof that has been finally approved and shall
so notify the City, in writing; or in the event the landowner shall fail
to commence and carry out the planned residential development in
168. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10508.
