ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 72-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Perkasie Borough
Cable Television Ordinance."
§ 72-2. Purpose.
A. The Borough of Perkasie finds that the development of cable television,
communications systems and other multichannel service technologies
have the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the people of
Bucks County. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology
associated with cable television, the Borough further finds that the
public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the Borough
or such persons as the Borough shall designate. It is the intent of this
chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the
means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in
these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to
the Borough's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband,
interactive communications services to institutions and individuals.
C. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
(1) Multichannel services should be available to all Borough residents.
(2) The system should be capable of accommodating both the present
and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the
Borough and its residents and be upgraded to correspond to
present state of the art.
(3) The system shall be constructed and maintained during the
franchise term so that new components may be integrated to the
maximum extent possible with existing facilities.
(4) The communications system authorized by this chapter shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community.

upon which a franchise fee has already been paid by an affiliate or the
franchisee) or any person in which the franchisee has a financial interest,
or by any other entity that is a cable operator of the system arising from,
attributable to, or in any way derived from the operation of the franchisee's
cable system, including the studios and other facilities associated therewith.
Gross receipts shall not include state and federal taxes relating thereto, or
any amounts collected from subscribers as a franchise fee hereunder. To
the extent that any charges, fees or consideration of any kind are collected
or charged on a basis that makes it impossible to determine the amount

Borough reasonably determines are appropriate in the circumstances, it
being understood and agreed that, at a minimum, in each case, such terms
and conditions may include payment to the Borough of compensation at
rates different from those set forth for franchise fees. The franchisee shall
pay to the Borough an amount equal to the reasonable costs for the use of
§ 72-4 PERKASIE CODE § 72-4
70:84
the Borough's streets to provide noncable services in the franchise area.
Payment of such costs and expenses shall not be deemed to be franchise
fees within the meaning of the Cable Act, and such payments shall not be
deemed to be payments-in-kind or involuntary payments chargeable against
the compensation to be paid to the Borough by the franchisee as franchise
fees or part of the compensation to be paid to the Borough by the franchisee
as franchise fees.
PAY AUDIO/VIDEO  Any type of audio or audio/video service for which a

hereafter held by the Borough which shall entitle the Borough and the
grantee to the use thereof for the purpose of installing and maintaining the
grantee cable television system. No reference herein, or in any franchise,
to the "public way" shall be deemed to be a representation or guaranty by
the Borough that its title to any property is sufficient to permit its use for
such purpose, and the grantee shall, by its use of such terms, be deemed to
gain only such rights to use property in the Borough as the Borough may
have the undisputed right and power to give. The grantee is also authorized
to utilize public rights-of-way and easements within the Borough that have
been dedicated for compatible uses as provided for in Section 621(a)(2) of
the Cable Act, provided that grantee shall have signed a pole attachment
and underground conduit agreement.
REASONABLE NOTICE  Where not elsewhere specified, shall be written
notice addressed to the grantee at its office as the grantee has designated to
the Borough as the address to which notice shall be transmitted to it, which

from one person or group of persons to another person or group of persons
so that control or controlling interest of the franchisee is transferred;
or the rights and/or obligations held by the franchisee under a franchise
agreement are transferred or assigned to another person or group of
persons. Control or controlling interest means actual working control in
whatever manner exercised, including, without limitation, working control
through ownership, management, debt instruments or negative control, as
the case may be, of a system, a franchise or a franchisee. A rebuttable
presumption of the existence of control or a controlling interest may arise

ARTICLE III
Grant of Franchise
§ 72-5. Grant and continuing obligations.
A. No cable communication system shall be allowed to provide
multichannel service to the Borough residents without a franchise. The
Borough reserves the right to build, own and operate such systems as it
deems appropriate.
B. In the event that the Borough shall grant to a grantee a nonexclusive
revocable franchise to construct, operate and maintain a cable
communications system within the Borough, said franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a
cable communications system as regulated by the provisions of this
chapter and a franchise agreement.
C. The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions
contained herein, consistent with the Borough Code and/or other
applicable statutory requirements.
D. Any franchise granted by the Borough is hereby made subject to the
general ordinances provisions now in effect and hereafter made
effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the
requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the Borough
regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction.
E. State of the art continuing obligation.
(1) General reguirement. Throughout the term of any franchise
agreement, the franchisee shall construct, operate, maintain and
upgrade the cable communications system in order to ensure that it
conforms to the state of the art in accordance with the
requirements set forth in the franchise agreement; provided,
however, that "state of the art" shall be presumed to mean such
technology that is being provided to at least 1/4 of all cable
households nationwide.
(2) State of the art report. Except as may be required in the franchise
agreement, a franchisee shall provide to the Borough, in a form
satisfactory to the Borough, at the Borough's request, but no more
often than once every year, a report setting forth the franchisee's
review and assessment of the current state of the art of cable
communications systems and its plans, if any, for upgrading the
system to conform to the state of the art. The report shall address
such matters as technological advances making possible enhanced
signal quality, publicly available equipment for the receipt of
services or greater channel capacity and interactive systems; a list
of each jurisdiction in which new technologies have been or are
being used and a description of the experience those jurisdictions
have had with such new technologies, an assessment of the costs
§ 72-5 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION § 72-5
70:87
associated with implementing such new technologies into the
system; the franchisee's activities to enhance or advance such
technology in connection with the system and any other cable
communications system or systems operated by the franchisee or
any affiliate in the Borough or elsewhere and the franchisee's
compliance with and any modifications with respect thereto; an
assessment of the need to scramble signals distributed over the
system in order to prevent theft of service (such assessment to
investigate alternatives to scrambling of signals and include a cost/
benefit analysis of both scrambling and such alternatives that takes
into account significant costs and benefits both to the franchisee
and subscribers); a discussion of additional technological advances
anticipated during the remainder of the term of the franchise,
along with a projection of the costs and timetable for the franchisee
offering such advances as part of or over the system; a discussion
of what improvements the franchisee anticipates making in its
customer service facilities, equipment, systems and operations
during the remainder of the term of the franchise, along with a
projection of the costs and timetable for the implementation of
such improvements; a description of any technical experimentation
which the franchisee or any affiliate anticipates undertaking during
the remainder of the term of the franchise; an assessment of the
compatibility of the system with subscribers' televisions and video
cassette recorders, the franchisee's compliance with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the FCC pursuant to Section 624A
of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 544a) and any experimentation the
franchisee is making to enhance such compatibility; and, generally,
the steps the franchisee or any affiliate is undertaking to
continuously construct, operate, maintain and upgrade the system
in accordance with the state of the art. The state of the art report
submitted by a franchisee may be only one resource that the
Borough will consider in evaluating the franchisee's obligation
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ordinance to
continuously construct, operate, maintain and upgrade the system
in accordance with the state of the art, and the Borough may
commission third parties, as necessary, to ascertain the current
state of the art in cable communications systems generally.
(3) Procedures for maintaining state of the art. Upon receiving any
report from a franchisee required pursuant to the franchise
agreement and this section of this chapter, the Borough will
evaluate such report and may assemble any additional data
necessary to ascertain whether the franchisee's system or any
aspect thereof needs to be upgraded so that it meets the state of
the art requirement set forth herein.
(4) System upgrade. As more specifically provided in the franchise
agreement, after a system has been evaluated, the Borough and the
franchisee may meet to determine to what extent the system needs
to be upgraded to incorporate state of the art features. In the event
§ 72-5 PERKASIE CODE § 72-5
70:88
§ 72-6. Use of public rights-of-way.
For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications
system in the Borough, a grantee may erect, install, construct, repair,
replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along
the public streets and ways within the Borough such wires, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary
to the operation of the cable communications systems; provided, however,
that the grantee complies with all design, construction, safety and
performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement,
pole attachment agreement and other applicable laws, including, but not
limited to, the Federal Technical Performance Standards, National
Electrical Safety Code (current edition) and the pole attachment and
underground conduit agreement.
§ 72-7. Franchise required.
No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the
streets of the Borough or be allowed to operate without a franchise.
that the Borough and the franchisee are unable to agree upon
whether it is economically and technically feasible and viable for
the franchisee to upgrade the system to incorporate state of the
art features, the issue shall be settled by arbitration administered
by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
applicable rules, and judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
(5) "State of the art," as applicable, means that level of technical or
service performance, capacity and capability (including, but not
limited to, plant or other equipment; access channel and other
production equipment or facilities; construction techniques;
customer service; facilities, equipment, systems and operations;
and performance standards) which has been developed and
demonstrated in the cable industry, or any other comparable
industry that provides services to the public under similar
conditions, to be workable and economically and technically
feasible and viable, from time to time, throughout the term of the
franchise.
(6) "Economically and technically feasible and viable" means capable
of being provided: through technology which has been
demonstrated in actual applications (not simply through tests or
experiments) to operate in a workable manner; and in a manner
which has a reasonable likelihood of generating additional
revenues or other financial benefits for a system, when measured
over the term of the franchise.
§ 72-5 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION § 72-8
70:89
§ 72-8. Term of franchise.
The term of any franchise as granted pursuant to this chapter shall be
specified in the franchise agreement in the discretion of the Borough.
§ 72-9. Franchise to be nonexclusive.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The
Borough specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional
franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate, and/
or build, operate and own such cable communications system or systems as
it deems appropriate.
§ 72-10. Transfer of ownership or control.
Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, any transfer of a
franchise shall conform to the following provisions:
A. Transfer of franchise. No franchise granted hereunder shall be
transferred and no control or controlling interest in any system,
franchise or franchisee shall be transferred without the prior written
consent of the Borough, and then only under such reasonable
conditions as the Borough may establish, and only if in compliance with
Section 617 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 537) and regulations
promulgated by the FCC to implement Section 617.
B. The franchisee shall promptly notify the Borough by written petition of
any proposed transfer. The petition shall fully describe the proposed
action and shall be accompanied by a justification for the action and, if
applicable, an argument as to why such action would not involve a
change in control or controlling interest. The Borough shall notify the
franchisee as soon as all of the information required by the FCC, the
franchise agreement, this and all applicable state and local law has
been received by the Borough and that therefore the petition is
complete, after which the Borough shall take action within 120 days
following the date such notice is provided by the Borough, pursuant to
Section 617(e) of the Cable Act.
C. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer,
the Borough may inquire, with the assistance of the grantee, into the
legal, financial, character, technical, customer service and operations
qualifications of the prospective controlling party and the effect that the
proposed transfer and sale price may have on rates being paid by
subscribers. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by
the Borough as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the
proposed transfer. If the Borough finds the results of this inquiry are
satisfactory, its consent to such transfer shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
D. Assumption of control. Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the
§ 72-8 PERKASIE CODE § 72-10
70:90
§ 72-11. Franchise fees.
construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to
notify the Borough that it or its designees satisfactory to the Borough
will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, said
financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations
during the term the financial institution exercises control over the
system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the
system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the Borough
at its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right
to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the
Borough finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial,
character, technical customer service, and operations qualifications of
the applicant are satisfactory and that the proposed transfer and sale
price will not result in a rate increase to subscribers, the Borough will
transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in
the public interest. The consent of the Borough to such transfer shall
not be unreasonably withheld.
E. The consent or approval of the Borough to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Borough in
and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise
agreement.
F. The Borough reserves the right to review the purchase price of any
transfer or assignment of the cable television system. Any negotiated
sale value which the Borough deems unreasonable will not be
considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate
increases, if permitted by applicable law and § 72-18 of this chapter.
G. Any approval by the Borough of transfer of ownership or control shall
be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement.
H. The transfer of any franchise or the transfer of control or controlling
interest in any system, franchise or franchisee without the prior written
consent of the Borough shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the
system by the franchisee under § 72-32 of this chapter and shall entitle
the Borough to all of the rights set forth under § 72-32.
A. Because the Borough finds that the streets of the county, state and
Borough to be used by the grantee in the operation of this system within
the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties
acquired and maintained by the county, state and Borough at great
expense to its taxpayers; and the grant to the grantee to said streets is a
valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to

other consultants) in connection with any renegotiation, transfer,
amendment or other modification of this chapter or the franchise
(where such action is specifically initiated by the grantee or an affiliated
person at such time and in such manner as the Borough Manager shall
specify. Payments of such costs and expenses shall not be deemed to be
"franchise fees" within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable Act (47
U.S.C. § 542), and such payments shall not be deemed to be paymentsin-
kind or involuntary payments chargeable against any other
compensation to be paid to the Borough by the grantee.

not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement,
the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,

agreement and shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise.
The Borough shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a
statement certified by the grantee's certified public accountant or other
appropriate corporate representative reflecting the total amounts of
gross revenues for the period conveyed by the payment.
E. The Borough shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income
records upon 15 days' written notice and the right to audit and to
recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter
for a period of five years from the date of payment. One audit per year

material obligations under this chapter or under such documents,
contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and
between the Borough and the grantee.
(2) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or any
performance bond or security fund as required.

(5) If it is determined that the grantee willfully underpaid its franchise
fee by 15% or more for any year.
(6) If the grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the
schedule contained in the franchise agreement or beyond any
extended date set by the Borough.
(7) If there is an occurrence of any event which may reasonably lead to
the foreclosure or other similar judicial or nonjudicial sale of all or
any material part of the system, including, but not limited to, any of
the following events:
(a) Default under any loan or any financing arrangement material
to the system or the obligations of the grantee under the
franchise agreement;
(b) Default under any contract material to the system or the
obligations of the grantee under the franchise agreement; or
(c) Termination of any lease or mortgage covering all or any
material part of the system.
(8) If in regards to any grantee:
(a) A grantee shall suspend or discontinue its business, shall make
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, shall fail to pay its

pursuant to state or local laws, ordinances or regulations of or
for it or any substantial part of its property or assets, including
all or any part of this system; or

excused pursuant to Subsection B.

controlling interest in any system, franchise or in the grantee itself
without the prior written consent of the Borough pursuant to the
provisions set forth in § 72-10 of this chapter.

any other provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement, a
grantee shall not be liable for delay in performance of or failure to
perform in whole or in part its obligations pursuant to the franchise
agreement or this chapter due to force majeure. In the event that any
such delay in performance or failure to perform affects only part of a
company's capacity to perform, the company shall perform to the
maximum extent that it is able to do so and shall take all steps within its
power to correct such cause or causes. In correcting such cause or
causes, a grantee shall take all reasonable steps to do so in as
expeditious a manner as possible. A grantee shall notify the Borough in
writing of the occurrence of an event covered by this subsection within
five business days of the date upon which the grantee learns of this
occurrence. Shortage or unavailability of equipment from suppliers
shall not be deemed to be beyond the control of the grantee in regards
to any construction delays.
C. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the
§ 72-12 PERKASIE CODE § 72-12
70:94
performance of its obligations under this chapter or the franchise
agreement. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations because
of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation
pursuant to the provisions of this section. The Borough shall comply
with any related court orders.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The Borough shall make written demand that the grantee do so
comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule
or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation.
After written demand is made, the Borough may place its request
for revocation of the franchise upon a regular Council meeting
agenda. The Borough shall cause to be served upon such grantee at
least 30 days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written
notice of this intent to request such revocation, and the time and
place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the
Borough once, at least seven days before such meeting, in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Borough.
(2) The Council shall hear any persons interested therein and shall
determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or
neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
(3) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as determined by the Council, the Council shall direct the
grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such
terms and conditions as are reasonable.
(4) Enforcement is subject to applicable federal and state law. In the
event that the Borough, after such meeting, determines that the
grantee is in default of any provision of the franchise, the
franchising authority may:
(a) Foreclose on all or part of any security deposit provided under
the franchise, if any, including, without limitation any bonds or
other surety; provided, however, that the foreclosure shall only
be in such manner and in such amount as the Borough
reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default.
(b) Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek
other equitable relief.
(c) In the case of a substantial default of material provision of the
franchise, declare the chapter and franchise agreement to be
revoked.
(d) Seek specific performance of any provision.
(e) Seek any other legal or equitable remedies as may be available
to the franchising authority.

or otherwise terminated, the Borough may, in its sole discretion, do any
of the following:
(1) Order the removal of the system facilities from the Borough within
a reasonable period of time as determined by the Borough.
(2) Require the grantee to maintain and operate its system for a period
of up to 18 months or such further time as may be mutually agreed
upon. During any time the grantee continues to operate the system,
it shall do so pursuant to the terms of this chapter and its franchise
agreement and shall be entitled to the revenues from the system.
(3) Order that the system be transferred to another cable operator.
A. Termination by insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at
the option of the Borough, cease and terminate 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take
over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or similar action or proceeding, unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
(1) Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and the
receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all
defaults under this chapter or the franchise agreement; and
(2) Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to
be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the
franchise agreement and this chapter.
B. Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any
part thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the Borough may
serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder
at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of
the grantee granted hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after
service of such notice, unless:
(1) The Borough shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in
the manner this chapter provides; and
(2) Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
Borough to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of
the franchise agreement.

the franchise agreement shall be to the Borough Manager or his designee.

franchise, an address for service of notices by mail. The grantee shall
also maintain with the Borough, a local office and telephone number for
the conduct of matters related to the franchise during normal business

shall obtain and maintain during the entire term of the franchise and
any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost and expense, and file
with the Borough a corporate surety bond in such sum as specified in
the franchise agreement to guarantee the faithful performance by the
grantee of all its obligations provided under this chapter and the

conditions:
(1) There shall be recoverable by the Borough jointly and severally
from the principal and surety, any and all fines and liquidated
damages due to the Borough, as specified in the franchise

(b) The grantee assigns the franchise without the express written
consent of the Borough, provided that the grantee has been

has failed to cure same within 30 days.
C. Reduction of bond. Upon written application by the grantee, the
Borough may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond to be

bond required by this section, the grantee shall obtain, maintain and

institution licensed to do business in the state in an amount specified by
the franchise agreement, naming the Borough as beneficiary. The form
and contents of such letter of credit shall be approved by the Borough
and shall be released only upon expiration of the franchise or upon the
replacement of the letter of credit by a successor grantee. Failure to
obtain the letter of credit within the time specified herein shall
constitute a substantial violation within the meaning of this chapter.

the item for which payment is claimed and the date it was due. The
grantee shall have 10 days from the receipt of such written notice to
make a full and complete payment. If the grantee does not make the
payment, the Borough may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest
and penalties, from the letter of credit or the performance bond.

or performance bond, the Borough shall send to the grantee, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the
amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal.

days after mailing to the grantee by certified mail notification of a
withdrawal pursuant to Subsection F above, the grantee shall replenish
the letter of credit or performance bond in an amount equal to the
amount so withdrawn. Failure to make timely replenishment of such
amount to the letter of credit or performance bond shall constitute a
substantial violation of this chapter.
H. Nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation of letter of credit or
performance bond. The performance bond or letter of credit required
herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the Borough and shall require
30 days' written notice of any nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation to

credit provided for herein are subject to reasonable increases at the
end of every three-year period of the franchise, applicable to the next
three-year period, upon the determination of the Borough.

deposit with the grantor at the expiration of the term of this franchise,
provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the
grantee.

grantor may have.

thereafter continuously through the duration of the franchise and any
extensions or renewals thereof, the grantee shall furnish to the Borough
certificates of insurance, approved by the Borough, for all types of

right to revoke the franchise agreement or revoke any construction
authorization in its discretion.

placed in any public ways by the grantee shall be placed in such a
manner as to interfere with normal travel on such public way.

§ 72-26. Use of streets.
A. All installations shall be underground in those areas of the Borough
where public utilities providing both telephone and electric service are

or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation,
the grantee may install its service above ground, provided that at such
time as both these facilities are required to be placed underground by
the Borough or are placed underground, the grantee shall likewise
place its services underground. Where not otherwise required to be
placed underground by this chapter or the franchise agreement, the
grantee's system shall be located underground at the request of a
property owner, provided that the excess cost over the aerial location

accordance with standards for such work set by the Borough. Weather
conditions permitting, such restoration shall be undertaken within no
more than 10 business days after the damage is incurred and shall be
completed within 30 business days, unless otherwise authorized by the
Borough.
D. Relocation of the facilities. In the event that at any time during the
period of the franchise, the Borough, county or state shall lawfully elect
to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways or
make repairs or improvements to any infrastructure, the grantee, upon
reasonable notice by the proper authority, shall remove or relocate as
necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and
other fixtures at its own expense and with all due deliberate speed. In
the event any utility is reimbursed for this same work, the grantee will
be reimbursed on the same terms and conditions.

any person holding a building moving permit issued by the Borough,
temporarily raise or lower its wire to permit the moving of buildings.

the option of the Borough, such trimming as may be required by the
grantee may be done by the Borough or under its supervision and
direction at the expense of the grantee. The grantee shall notify the
Borough prior to trimming any trees in the right-of-way.
G. Easements. All necessary easements over and under private property
shall be arranged for by the grantee. This language shall not be
interpreted to in any way impinge on the grantee's right to utilize public
rights-of-way and easements that have been dedicated for compatible
uses as provided for in Section 621(a)(2) of the Cable Act.
A. Prior to the erection of any towers, poles or conduits or the upgrade or
rebuild of the cable communications system under this chapter, the
grantee shall first submit to the Borough and other designated parties
for approval a concise description of the facilities proposed to be
erected or installed, including engineering drawings, if required,
together with a map and plans indicating the proposed location of all
such facilities. No erection or installation of any tower, pole,
underground conduit or fixture or any rebuilds or upgrading of the
cable communications system shall be commenced by any person until
approval therefor has been received from the Borough, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld.
B. Where poles already existing for use in serving the Borough are
available for use by the grantee, the Borough may require the grantee
to use such poles and structures; in which event the Borough and
grantee shall enter into a pole attachment and underground conduit
agreement acceptable to the Borough.

70:112

monthly basis throughout the entire initial construction or rebuilding
process. The Borough Manager may require more frequent reporting if
he determines it is necessary to better monitor the grantee's progress.
C. Prior to the commencement of any initial construction or rebuilding of a
cable television system, the grantee shall produce an informational
document to be distributed to all residents of the area to be under
construction, which shall describe the activity that will be taking place.
The informational document shall be reviewed and approved by the
Borough Manager prior to its distribution.

the Borough of Perkasie Technical Requirements for Customer Owned
Generation, as amended. An applicant for service may be required to

included in the rent and where the energy is not submetered.
§ 85-5. Use of three-phase service.
Where three-phase service is supplied, the current shall be taken equally
from the three phases as nearly as possible. Wherever the difference
between any two phases is greater than 10% of the lesser, the customer
shall make changes necessary to correct the unsatisfactory condition, or the
bill will be computed on the basis that the current taken from each phase is
equal to the greatest quantity taken from any one phase.
§ 85-6. Voltage fluctuations.

interfere with the Department's service to other customers, the customer
shall, upon notice from Department, make changes necessary to overcome
the fluctuations.
§ 85-7. Standard service; new nonstandard service.
Department's standard service is single- or three-phase, sixty-cycle
alternating current. Wherever such service has been established, all other
types of service will be considered as in process of elimination, and no new
nonstandard service will be supplied.

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 94-16. Identification.
§ 94-17. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Perkasie Borough,
classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated March 16, 2015 and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by Perkasie Borough and declared
to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those Special Flood Hazard Areas where no floodway
has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
§ 94-16 EXPLOSIVES § 94-17
88:183
§ 94-18. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the Special Flood Hazard Area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the Special Flood Hazard Area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 94-21B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 94-19. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough and any party aggrieved
by this decision or determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board.
The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE at any
point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
(1) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
§ 94-17 PERKASIE CODE § 94-20
88:184
§ 94-20. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
§ 94-20 EXPLOSIVES § 94-20
88:185

ARTICLE V
Technical Provisions
§ 94-21. General.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
(1) any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations
within the floodway; or (2) any development occurring in Zones A1-30
and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of
more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or (3) alteration or
relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts
and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44
CFR 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance
with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other applicable
codes, ordinances and regulations.
§ 94-21 EXPLOSIVES § 94-22

construction or substantial improvements in the identified floodplain area
in accordance with the criteria in Article VIII, then the following provisions
apply:
A. Residential structures.
(1) In AE, A1-30, and AH Zones, any new construction or substantial
improvement shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation.
(2) In A Zones, where there are no base flood elevations specified on
the FIRM, any new construction or substantial improvement shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to, or above,
the regulatory flood elevation determined in accordance with
§ 94-17C of this chapter.
(3) The design and construction standards and specifications
contained in the 2009 International Building Code (IBC) and in the
2009 International Residential Code (IRC) or the most recent
revisions thereof and ASCE 24 and 34 Pa. Code (Chapters 401
through 405 as amended) shall be utilized, where they are more
restrictive.
B. Nonresidential structures.
(1) In AE, A1-30 and AH Zones, any new construction or substantial
improvement of a nonresidential structure shall have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory
flood elevation, or be designed and constructed so that the space
enclosed below the regulatory flood elevation:
(a) Is floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and,
(b) Has structural components with the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(2) In A Zones, where no base flood elevations are specified on the
FIRM, any new construction or substantial improvement shall have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or completely
floodproofed up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation
determined in accordance with § 94-17C of this chapter.
(3) Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, made watertight
below the regulatory flood elevation shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the W1 or W2 space classification standards
contained in the publication entitled "Flood-Proofing Regulations"
published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (June 1972, as
amended March 1992) or with some other equivalent standard. All
§ 94-22 PERKASIE CODE § 94-22
88:188
plans and specifications for such floodproofing shall be
accompanied by a statement certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect which states that the proposed design and
methods of construction are in conformance with the above
referenced standards.
(4) The design and construction standards and specifications
contained in the 2009 International Building Code (IBC) and in the
2009 International Residential Code (IRC) or the most recent
revisions thereof and ASCE 24 and 34 Pa. Code (Chapters 401
through 405 as amended) shall be utilized, where they are more
restrictive.
C. Space below the lowest floor.
(1) Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (excluding basements)
which will be used solely for the parking of a vehicle, building
access, or incidental storage in an area other than a basement,
shall be designed and constructed to allow for the automatic entry
and exit of flood waters for the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic
forces on exterior walls. The term "fully enclosed space" also
includes crawl spaces.
(2) Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed
the following minimum criteria:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a net total area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed space.
(b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
(c) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.
D. Historic structures. Historic structures undergoing repair or
rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement as
defined in this chapter, must comply with all ordinance requirements
that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic
Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Any exemption from requirements will be the minimum necessary to

ARTICLE III
Sewer Use
[Adopted 4-18-1994 by Ord. No. 743]
§ 147-41. Objectives; implementation.
A. The objectives of this article are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Perkasie Regional
Authority (PRA) wastewater collection system that will interfere
with its operation, contaminate the biosolids generated at the
PWTA wastewater treatment plant or will otherwise be
incompatible with the system.
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the PRA's wastewater
collection system that will be inadequately treated and thus will
pass through the system into the receiving waters or the
atmosphere.
(3) To protect the environment, the general public, PRA and PWTA
personnel against the hazards associated with discharges of toxic
or otherwise incompatible pollutants into the sewer system.
(4) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim industrial
wastewaters and biosolids from the wastewater treatment system.
(5) To provide for equitable distribution of the cost for the
development and implementation of the PWTA's industrial
pretreatment program and other improvements to the wastewater
collection system.
(6) To help assure the PWTA's compliance with its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, biosolids use and
disposal requirements, the Clean Water Act, the General
Pretreatment Regulations and any other state or federal laws with
which the PRA or PWTA must comply.
B. The provisions of this article will be implemented and enforced by the
Borough of Perkasie through the PRA and the PWTA Manager through
issuance of wastewater contribution permits to those industrial/
commercial users meeting the EPA's definition of a significant industrial
user (SIU); through monitoring, reporting and enforcement of the
Article with these significant industrial users and all other users. This
article also assumes that the capacity of the sewer system allocated to
existing customers will not be preempted and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from development
and implementation of the program established herein.
C. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this article shall
be administered, implemented and enforced by the PWTA Manager and
will be coordinated through the PRA.

§ 147-44. Federal categorical pretreatment standards; notification
of changes.
Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards
for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more
stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under
this article. Each user or significant industrial user shall be responsible to
notify the PRA and the PWTA of changes to his status under the federal,
state or local regulations. The categorical pretreatment standards found
in 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, Part 405-471, are also hereby
incorporated into this article.
(12) Any wastewater that causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.

B. When the PRA or the PWTA determines that a user or significant
industrial user is contributing to the wastewater collection system any
of the above-prohibited substances to the system, the PWTA Manager
may advise the user of the impact of such contributions on the
wastewater collection system and develop effluent limitations and
compliance schedules which the user must meet to correct the
violation.
C. The PWTA or the PRA may take enforcement action(s) against the
noncomplying user or significant industrial user regardless of whether
the user or significant industrial user was given prior notification of the
violation by the PWTA.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the PWTA
Manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
B. When process wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard,
the PWTA Manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined
waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
C. A user may obtain a variance from EPA from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to his

§ 147-45. Modification of federal categorical pretreatment
standards.
Where the PWTA wastewater treatment plant achieves consistent removal
of pollutants limited by federal categorical pretreatment standards, the
PWTA may apply to the approval authority for modifications of specific
limits in the federal categorical pretreatment standards. "Consistent
removal" shall mean the reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration
of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater collection system to a less
toxic or harmless state in the effluent, which is achieved by the system in
95% of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set
forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 403, General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources
of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the Act. The PWTA may then modify
the pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the
requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval
from the approval authority is obtained.
§ 147-46. Specific pollutant limitations.
facilities discharge are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment
standard.
D. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
A. All wastewater entering the sanitary sewer system shall be pretreated
to typical domestic levels unless otherwise stated in writing by the
PWTA by way of the significant industrial user permit. Typical domestic
levels and specific pollutant limitations may require periodic change
because of changing NPDES requirements, required reevaluations of
the local limits analysis, or other reasons. At the time when such change
becomes necessary, modified local limits will be established and
formally adopted by the PWTA after modifications have been approved
by the approval authority (USEPA). Upon recommendation and
approval by the PWTA, industrial pretreatment limitations shall be
established and revised by Perkasie Borough by amendment of the
Sewer Use Ordinance. All existing limitations shall apply, even after
recommendation and approval of modifications by the PWTA, until such
time that the amendment of the Sewer Use Ordinance is lawfully
adopted and effective. [Amended 6-15-1998 by Ord. No. 810;

C. No user shall contribute toxic pollutants to the PRA sewer collection
system in excess of the local limits identified in the PWTA's most recent
USEPA-approved local limits evaluation. The approved local limits
evaluation is available for public inspection at the offices of the
Authority, 180 Maple Avenue, Sellersville, Pennsylvania, during the
regular business hours of the PWTA. At its discretion, the PWTA may
establish alternate mass limits for specific toxic pollutants in individual
wastewater contribution permits, but only in accordance with
regulatory requirements. At no time shall the total loading allocated to
the users in their permits for a specific pollutant be greater than the
allowable wastewater treatment plant industrial loading as determined
in the PWTA's most recent USEPA-approved local limits evaluation. The
local limits, if more stringent than the National Categorical Standards,
shall supersede the National Categorical Standards. [Amended

be considered local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes
of 40 CFR 403 and Section 307(d) of the Clean Water Act. The PWTA, in
consultation with PRA, may allow a user to implement BMPs to meet the
prohibitions listed in 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1) and (b) and § 147-43 of this
article. BMPs may also be implemented in addition to an approved limit
or prohibition. If BMPs are allowed, they will be implemented through
industrial user permits issued in accordance with §§ 147-53 through
147-55 of this article. Authorization of BMPs, in place of or in addition
to approved limits or prohibitions, does not relieve the user of
responsibility to comply with approved limits or prohibitions. [Added

E. A significant industrial user who commences contribution to the
wastewater collection system after the effective date of this article shall
not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until a slug
control plan has been approved by the PWTA. Review and approval of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the significant
industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility, as
necessary, to meet the requirements of this article.
F. All users are required to notify the PWTA immediately of any changes at
their facilities affecting the potential for an accidental discharge and/or
slug discharge to the PWTA. PWTA will immediately notify PRA of such

§ 147-68. Show-cause hearing.
When a response given by the user to a previous NOV is inadequate or when
a violation results in conditions that could cause the PWTA to violate its
NPDES permit or biosolids quality requirements or results in a hazardous
situation within the PWTA sewer system, the PWTA will notify a user by
certified mail of the requirement that the user attend a show-cause hearing.
A "show-cause hearing" is an official meeting between the PWTA and a user
to resolve conditions of continued violations. The hearing may result in the
PWTA issuing an administrative order to the user or assessment of civil
penalties.
§ 147-69. Administrative order.
An "administrative order" is an official enforcement document that directs a
user or significant industrial user to undertake or to cease specific activities
and that carries specific legal actions to be enforced when addressing
continued noncompliance. The order may contain a compliance schedule
specifying the time frame by which the user must perform certain activities
that will ultimately result in compliance with all requirements contained in
the order. The order may also contain the requirement that the user pay
civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation.
§ 147-70. Public notification of noncompliance. [Amended
3-19-2012 by Ord. No. 956]
The PWTA shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation
that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by
the PWTA, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were
in significant noncompliance (as defined in § 147-42 of this article) with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The PWTA shall
provide PRA with the names of any users within the PRA system who will be
on such list at least 30 days prior to publication of the list.
§ 147-71. Harmful contributions.
E. The signature of an authorized representative of the user that certifies
to the validity of the report.
A. The PRA or the PWTA may suspend the wastewater treatment service
and/or wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of PRA or the PWTA, in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons and/or the
environment, which causes or threatens to cause interference to the
POTW or causes or threatens to cause the PWTA to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.
B. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person

state and federal regulations is subject to having his permit revoked in
accordance with the procedures of §§ 147-67 through 147-75 of this article:
§ 147-73. Appeal.
A user, upon receipt of notification of suspension or revocation of a user
permit or significant industrial user permit, may appeal the decision, in
writing, to the PWTA Manager, with a statement of reasons therefor, within
10 days of the notice. Such an appeal shall not be cause for the discharge
to continue if the suspension or revocation was issued to stop a harmful
contribution under § 147-71.
§ 147-74. Notice of hearing; costs.
Thereafter, upon notice, in writing, given to the permit holder or any
agent or officer thereof at least five days prior to the time fixed, the
PWTA Manager shall convene and conduct a hearing on the propriety
or lack thereof of the notice of suspension or revocation. The cost of
the stenographic transcript of such a proceeding shall be borne by the
appellant, who shall pay a filing fee of $300.
§ 147-75. Method of decision.
The findings and determinations of the PWTA shall be in writing and shall
be mailed to the user's authorized representative within 48 hours of the
hearing, with a certified copy thereof to be filed with the PWTA Manager
who originally served the notice of suspension or revocation. The
to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the PRA or the PWTA
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage
to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The PRA or
the PWTA may reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or
the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent
any future occurrence shall be submitted by the user to the PRA and
the PWTA within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
A. Failure of the user to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of his discharge;

§ 147-76. Action following appeal decision.
If the decision of the PWTA sustains the notice of suspension or revocation
of permit, the user shall be given 10 days' notice of the new date of
suspension or revocation by the PWTA.
§ 147-77. Civil penalty assessment.
A. In addition to the other enforcement actions described within the PWTA
Enforcement Response Plan (ERP), the PWTA may also seek to assess
civil penalties and enjoin any user who fails to comply with the
requirements of this article or his wastewater contribution permit.
B. Civil penalties vary from $500 up to $25,000 per day per violation
depending on the severity of the violation and other factors. In civil
penalty assessment, the PWTA will consider all of the following factors:
(1) Damage to the PWTA treatment plant or collection system, the
environment or collection system personnel, resulting from the
violation.
(2) The user's history of past violations.
(3) The level of cooperation obtained from the user.
(4) The economic benefit gained by the users as a result of the
noncompliance.
(5) Other relevant factors.
C. The general civil assessment policy of the PWTA is given in Table 1 of
the PWTA Enforcement Response Plan. All fines were developed in
accordance with the Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law
(Pennsylvania Act 9) and will be assessed on a per-day, per-violation
basis. The PWTA has the right to increase, reduce or waive the fines in
certain circumstances.
D. All civil penalties collected pursuant to the PWTA Civil Penalty
Assessment Policy will be placed in a restricted account and shall only
be used by the PWTA for the repair of damage and any additional
maintenance or other costs resulting from the violation(s) on which the
penalty was imposed, to pay any penalties imposed on the PWTA by a
state or federal agency as a result of violating any pretreatment
standards, for the costs incurred by the PWTA to investigate and initiate
enforcement actions against the noncomplying discharge (including
legal and engineering fees), for additional monitoring costs associated
with the noncomplying user and for capital improvements to the
treatment plant or collection system required by the pretreatment
program. Any remaining funds may be used for capital improvements to

The user charged with any penalty previously described or who wishes to
contest an administrative order shall have 30 days to pay the assessed
penalty in full; or, if the user wishes to contest either the amount of the
penalty or the fact of the violation, the user must file an appeal of the action
to the PWTA Board within 30 days pursuant to the Local Agency Law, 2
Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
the treatment plant or collections system not required by the industrial
pretreatment program.
E. The PWTA's ability to assess civil penalties against noncomplying users
shall apply to all users of the PWTA wastewater collection system
regardless of political boundary.
A. The PWTA and PRA shall be able to seek injunctive relief for
noncompliance by users with pretreatment standards or requirements
or related provisions. Injunctive relief is available for violations of
pretreatment standards or requirements, any requirement stated in this
part or user permits, including, but not limited to: [Amended
3-19-2012 by Ord. No. 956]
(1) A discharge from a user presents an imminent or substantial
danger to the environment.
(2) A discharge from a user causes the PWTA to violate any condition
of its NPDES permit, biosolids application standards, or other state
or federal requirement.
(3) A discharge from a user presents an imminent or substantial
danger to the PWTA treatment plant, the collection system or the
general public.
(4) The user has shown a lack of ability or intention to comply with a

956]
Wastewater samples collected to comply with any provision of this article
shall meet the following requirements:
A. Samples shall be collected using twenty-four-hour flow proportional
composite collection techniques. In the event that flow proportional
composite sampling is not warranted in the opinion of the PWTA, the
PWTA may authorize the use of time proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling are authorized by the PWTA, the samples must be
representative of the discharge and the PWTA will solely determine the
number of grab samples required.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides,
and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using standard grab
collection techniques.
C. The PWTA may allow multiple grab samples collected during a twentyfour-
hour time period for certain parameters to be composited in the
field or in the laboratory prior to analysis if proper protocols specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance documents are
followed. For cyanide, total phenols and sulfides, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field. For volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the PWTA, as appropriate.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 158-1. Statement of findings.
The Borough Council of Perkasie Borough finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, degrades water
quality, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and
manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Borough and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Through project design, impacts from stormwater runoff can be
minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime, and sustain high
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream baseflow, and aquatic
ecosystems. The most cost-effective and environmentally advantageous
way to manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project
design, minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoiding sensitive
areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and designing to
topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
D. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens.
E. The aforementioned impacts happen mainly through a decrease in
natural infiltration of stormwater.
F. Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
G. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
H. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are

the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 158-1 of this chapter through provisions
designed to:
required to obtain a federal permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
I. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
Borough.
A. Meet water quality requirements under state law, including regulations
at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain existing uses and
maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams.
B. Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMP).
C. Minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flow.
D. Minimize impervious surfaces.
E. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
F. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
G. Maintain the predevelopment volume of groundwater recharge and
prevent degradation of groundwater quality.
H. Maintain the predevelopment peak and volume of stormwater runoff
and prevent degradation of surface water quality.
I. Minimize nonpoint source pollutant loadings to the ground and surface
waters.
J. Minimize impacts on stream temperatures.
K. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the
Borough and the commonwealth.
L. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
M. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities and best management practices that
are implemented in the Borough.
N. Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide

incorporate biologic controls consistent with the West Nile Guidance
found in Appendix D of this chapter.99
A. Mapping of Stormwater Runoff Peak Rate Districts. In order to
implement the provisions of the Tohickon Creek Watershed stormwater
management plan and East Branch Perkiomen Creek Watershed
stormwater management plan, Perkasie Borough is hereby divided into
Stormwater Runoff Peak Rate Districts consistent with the plans. The
boundaries of the districts are indicated on the runoff peak rate district
map that is available for inspection at the Borough Administration
Building (a large-scale Watershed Boundary Map is included as
Appendix C for reference100). Proposed conditions peak rates of runoff
from any regulated activity shall meet the peak release rates of runoff
prior to development for the design storms specified in § 158-13C, D
and E of this chapter.
B. The exact location of the Stormwater Runoff Peak Rate District
boundary as it applies to a given development site shall be determined
by mapping the boundaries using the two-feet or five-feet topographic
contours. The district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with
topographic divides or, in certain instances, are drawn from the
intersection of the watercourse or a potential flow obstruction to the
topographic divide consistent with topography. This information shall
be provided as part of the stormwater management site plan. The
locations determined on the plan shall be reviewed and verified by the
Borough Engineer.

F. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located in both the Tohickon Creek Watershed and the East Branch
Perkiomen Creek, and/or within two or more release rate management
districts, the peak discharge rate shall be the predevelopment peak
discharge for each management district area multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether proposed grading or drainage facilities result in
modification of the boundary of the watershed or management district.
G. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development
site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable

impacts).
peak runoff rates or volume reduction. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site for the one-hundred-year frequency storm event.
H. Site areas. Where the area of a site being impacted by a proposed
development activity not associated with a subdivision or land
development differs significantly from the total site area as determined
by the Borough Engineer, the Borough may, but is not required to,
permit only the proposed impact area, which includes areas of the site
to be compacted due to construction activity, to be subject to the
release rate criteria (performance standards).
I. Stormwater conveyance corridor protection (riparian corridor
preservation and vegetation). Runoff from developed areas of the site,
including but not limited to areas of impervious surface, shall be
managed through a series of riparian corridor vegetation facilities
whenever possible. This will be accomplished in a manner satisfactory
to the Borough, utilizing the "Pennsylvania Handbook of best
management practices for Developing Areas," 1998, Riparian Forested
Buffer, and the priority goal of the riparian vegetation will be the
reduction of thermal impacts on stormwater runoff associated with
impervious areas, with a secondary goal being the protection of
capacity of existing stormwater conveyance channels. These goals will
be achieved through the use of design criteria in § 158-18I of this
chapter, and shall be in addition to any other Borough ordinance
provisions.
A. The design of all regulated activities shall include the following steps in
sequence to minimize stormwater impacts.
(1) The applicant is required to find practicable alternatives to the
surface discharge of stormwater, the creation of impervious
surfaces, and the degradation of waters of the commonwealth, and
must maintain as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime of
the site.
(2) An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being
completed after considering cost, existing technology, and logistics
in light of overall project purposes, and other Borough
requirements.
(3) All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are
presumed to have less adverse impact on quantity and quality of
waters of the commonwealth unless otherwise demonstrated.
B. The applicant shall demonstrate that regulated activities are designed
in the following sequence to minimize the increases in stormwater
runoff and impacts to water quality:
§ 158-13 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-14
152:365
(1) Prepare an existing resources and site analysis map (ERSAM),
showing environmentally sensitive areas including, but not limited
to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands, hydric soils,
vernal pools, floodplains, riparian corridors, hydrologic soil groups
A, B, C, and D, woodlands, surface waters regulated by the state or
federal government, any existing recharge areas, and any other
requirements outlined in the Subdivision and Land Development
and Zoning Ordinances.101
(2) Prepare a draft project layout avoiding sensitive areas identified in
§ 158-14B(1) and minimizing total site earth disturbance as much
as possible. The ratio of disturbed area to the entire site area and
measures taken to minimize earth disturbance shall be included in
the ERSAM.
(3) Identify site specific existing conditions, drainage areas, discharge
points (points of interest), recharge areas, and hydrologic soil
groups A and B.
(4) Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives (refer
to the Pennsylvania BMP Manual).
(a) Minimize earth disturbance.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces.
(c) Break up large impervious surface areas.
(d) Protect existing trees [not within protected areas as described
in § 158-14B(1)].
(e) Direct rooftop runoff to pervious areas.
(f) Revegetate and reforest disturbed areas.
(g) Utilize natural flow pathways.
(5) Satisfy volume control standards (§ 158-15).
(6) Satisfy water quality objective (§ 158-16).
(7) Satisfy stream bank erosion protection objective (§ 158-17).
(8) Determine the management district within which the site is located
(refer to § 158-13 and Appendix C102) and conduct a
predevelopment runoff analysis.
(9) Prepare final project design to maintain predevelopment drainage
areas and discharge points, to minimize earth disturbance and

impervious surfaces, to reduce runoff to the maximum extent
possible, and to minimize the use of surface or point discharges.
(10) Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis, based on the final
design, to meet the release rate criteria (performance standards).
(11) Manage any remaining runoff through treatment prior to
discharge, as part of detention, biorentention, direct discharge or
other structural control.
A. For all regulated activities not exempt from requirements of this
chapter pursuant to § 158-5B and § 158-5C, water volume mitigation
controls shall be implemented. The total volume of runoff that must be
infiltrated may be calculated based on the Design Storm Method, in
which case the post-development total runoff volume shall not be
increased from predevelopment total runoff volume for all design
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation. The Design Storm Method requires detailed stormwater
runoff modeling based on site conditions. The required recharge
volume may also be determined based on Equation 158-15.1, described
in § 158-15D. The recharge volume (Rev) must either be reused,
evapotranspired, or infiltrated through structural and/or nonstructural
means. An alternative standard is allowed in this chapter where it can
be demonstrated that due to existing natural site conditions [refer to
§ 158-15A(1)(b)], substantial infiltration and recharge are not occurring
in the predevelopment condition resulting in greater than anticipated
runoff volume.
(1) Alternate standard for runoff volume.
(a) Applicants may request from Perkasie Borough that an
alternate standard be applied, where a portion of the runoff
volume requirement of § 158-15A is not achieved but at least
50% of the total required volume of infiltrated runoff is
achieved. Use of this alternate standard is permitted by the
Borough only after thorough scrutiny has been directed toward
all possible stormwater management options at all possible
locations at the site, consistent with the process set forth in
§ 158-15A(1).
(b) Required analysis for allowing use of alternate standard for
runoff volume. The alternate standard shall be used only in
those situations where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Borough that due to natural site conditions infiltration is
not occurring in the predevelopment condition, resulting in
greater runoff volumes (than would normally be anticipated)
due to bedrock near or at the surface (less than two feet in
depth); presence of seasonal high water table (SHWT) (less
than two feet in depth); and soils with low permeability (e.g.,
§ 158-14 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-15
152:367
0.20 inches per hour or less). Alternate standard shall be
permitted by the Borough only in those cases where the
applicant has demonstrated that one or all of the above
described conditions exist throughout the site, such that there
is no reasonable means of infiltrating required stormwater
volumes and that the property cannot be reasonably developed
utilizing a stormwater management system which infiltrates
the two-year frequency storm event volume (difference
between the pre and post-development storm). The applicant
must demonstrate that there is no area of the site where the
runoff volume requirement can feasibly be infiltrated. It is not
grounds for approval of the alternate standard that infiltrating
the runoff volume requirement will utilize areas that could
otherwise be developed to obtain the most building area or
lots.
(c) Applicants requesting to utilize the alternate standard must
provide a feasibility study for infiltration utilizing BMPs as well
as other runoff volume stormwater management systems and
provide the following information:
[1] Site plan demonstrating the extent of site area with
seasonal high water table (SHWT) (less than two feet): The
site will be evaluated both as to the extent of site with
SHWT and the actual locations of SHWT areas. Use of the
alternate standard shall be permitted by the Borough only
in those cases where it is demonstrated that site areas free
of SHWT are not feasible for use as stormwater BMPs (i.e.,
they are located upgradient from reasonable site building
areas).
[2] Site plan demonstrating extent of site area with less than
two feet to bedrock: The site will be evaluated both as to
the extent of site with shallow depth to bedrock and actual
locations of shallow bedrock areas. Use of the alternate
standard shall be permitted by the Borough only in those
cases where it is demonstrated that site areas free of
shallow bedrock constraints are not feasible for use as
stormwater BMPs (i.e., they are located upgradient from
reasonable site building areas).
[3] The site plan shall demonstrate the extent of site area with
less than 0.20 inches/hour of permeability in accordance
with the soil testing protocol set forth in § 158-15E and
Appendix B.103
[4] Sum of infiltration area.
103. Editor's Note: This appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 158-15 PERKASIE CODE § 158-15
152:368
[a] In order to utilize the alternate standard, the applicant
must demonstrate that the sum total of limited
infiltration areas [the total of areas described in
§ 158-15A(1)(c)[1] through § 158-15A(1)(c)[3]] exceed
the following percentages of the total site:
[i] 75% (sites less than five acres).
[ii] 80% (sites five to 10 acres).
[iii] 85% (sites greater than 10 acres).
[b] In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that there
is no feasible site area free of the above described
infiltration constraining features which exist in a
location such that the runoff volume requirement can
be achieved.
B. If it is determined to the satisfaction of the Borough that the recharge
volume standard set forth in § 158-15A cannot be achieved, then the
peak rate standards for post-development runoff are modified so that
peak rate discharges from the site for all storms up to the ten-year
frequency design storm must be additionally reduced to be equal to or
less than 75% of the design peak rates permitted pursuant to § 158-13.
C. Water volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts, protect
stream channel morphology, maintain groundwater recharge, and
contribute to water quality improvements. The applicant must
demonstrate how the required recharge volume is controlled through
stormwater best management practices (BMPs) which shall provide the
means necessary to capture, reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate
the total runoff volume. The low-impact development practices
provided in the Pennsylvania BMP Manual shall be utilized for all
regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Volume
controls provided through nonstructural BMPs may be subtracted from
the required recharge volume to determine the volume of structural
BMPs necessary for compliance with § 158-15A of this chapter. Design
and applicability of nonstructural BMPs is identified pursuant to
Chapter 5 of the Pennsylvania BMP Manual. For all proposed
nonstructural BMPs, the applicant shall utilize and submit applicable
checklists included in Chapter 8, Section 8.8 of the Pennsylvania BMP
Manual, to demonstrate that the BMPs are applicable to the project and
to determine the amount of volume credit that may be applied to the
development activity.
D. To determine the volume of runoff that must be infiltrated at a site, the
recharge volume (Rev), the following calculation formula may be used:
Equation 158-15.1
Rev = [(S)(Rv)(A)]/12 (inches/foot)
§ 158-15 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-15
152:369
Where:
Rev = Recharge Volume (acre-feet)
S = Soil specific recharge factor (inches)
A = Site area contributing to the recharge facility (acres)
Rv = Volumetric runoff coefficient, Rv = 0.05 + 0.009 (I),
Where:
I = percent of the area that is impervious surface
(impervious area ÷ total project study area) x
100%.
"S" shall be obtained based upon hydrologic soil group
based upon the table below:
Hydrologic Soil Group
Soil Specific Recharge Factor
(S)
A 0.38
B 0.26
C 0.14
D 0.07
If more than one hydrologic soil group (HSG) is present at a site,
a composite recharge volume shall be computed based upon the
proportion of total site area within each HSG.
E. Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall
be selected based on the suitability of soils and site conditions. All
applicants proposing regulated activities that are not exempt from
preparation and submission of a stormwater management site plan
(SMSP) are required to perform a detailed soils evaluation of the
project site by a qualified geotechnical engineer, geologist and/or soil
scientist, pursuant to Appendix B of this chapter,104 which at minimum
addresses soil permeability, soil mottling, depth to groundwater table,
depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade
stability. Infiltration/permeability tests shall be completed (in
conjunction with the soils evaluation) with an infiltrometer or other
method approved by the Borough Engineer, pursuant to Appendix B, to
determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil (at the
location and the level of the proposed infiltration surface(s).
"Percolation" tests are not permitted for design of infiltration BMPs,
unless approved by the Borough Engineer.
F. Infiltration BMPs must include safeguards against groundwater
contamination for uses where it is anticipated that pollutants may enter
the facility, by mishap or spill or where salt or chloride might be a
nonpoint source contaminant since soils do little to filter this pollutant.
104. Editor's Note: This appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 158-15 PERKASIE CODE § 158-15
152:370
§ 158-16. Water quality requirements.
If it is anticipated that pollutants may enter the infiltration facility
(or other stormwater facility impounding water), resulting in potential
groundwater contamination, Perkasie Borough may require the
developer to submit a hydrogeologic study of the site and proposed
infiltration BMPs, prepared by a qualified design professional, to
determine the risk for such contamination. The Borough may require
the installation of a mitigative layer or an impermeable liner in the
BMP and/or detention basins where the possibility of groundwater
contamination exists.
G. Infiltration BMPs within high quality/exceptional value waters shall be
subject to PADEP's Title 25, Chapter 93, Antidegradation Regulations.
H. The requirements for volume control and infiltration are applied to all
disturbed areas, even if they are ultimately to be a pervious or
permeable land use given the extent to which development-related
disturbance leads to compaction of the soils and reduces their
infiltrative capacity.
I. If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be demonstrated
that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
J. Infiltration BMPs shall be designed in accordance with the design
criteria and specifications of the Pennsylvania Stormwater BMP Manual
(2006) and as additionally identified pursuant to § 158-18I(1) of this
chapter.
A. In addition to the performance standards and design criteria
requirements of Article III of this chapter, adequate storage and
treatment facilities must be provided to capture and treat stormwater
runoff from developed or disturbed areas, unless otherwise exempted
by provisions of this chapter. The recharge volume computed under
§ 158-15 may be a component of the water quality volume if the
applicant chooses to manage both components in a single facility. If the
recharge volume is less than the water quality volume, the remaining
water quality volume may be captured and treated by methods other
than recharge/infiltration BMPs. The required water quality volume
(WQv) is the storage capacity needed to capture and to treat a portion
of stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the site produced
from 90% of the average annual rainfall (P). The following calculation
formula is to be used to determine the required water quality storage
volume, (WQv), in acre-feet of storage:
Equation 158-16.1
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12 (inches/foot)
§ 158-15 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-16
152:371
Where:
P = Rainfall Amount equal to 90% of events producing this
rainfall (inches). The P value to be utilized to meet this
requirement is 1.95 inches.
A = Area of the project contributing to the water quality BMP
(acres).
Rv = Volumetric Runoff Coefficient, 0.05 + 0.009(I), where I
is the percent of the area that is impervious surface
(impervious area ÷ total project study area) x 100%.
B. Provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the bottom of
the BMP facility outflow control structure) so that the proposed
condition, one-year frequency design storm takes a minimum of 24
hours to drain from the facility from a point where the maximum volume
of water from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum water
surface elevation is achieved in the facility). The design of the facility
shall minimize clogging and sedimentation. Orifices smaller than three
inches in diameter are not recommended. However, if the design
engineer can verify that the smaller orifice is protected from clogging
by use of trash racks, etc., smaller orifices may be permitted. Trash
racks are required for any primary orifice.
C. To accomplish Subsection A and B above, the land developer may
submit original and innovative designs to the Borough Engineer for
review and approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality
objectives through a combination of BMPs. Infiltration BMPs shall be
used wherever feasible. Wet ponds, artificial wetlands, or other
permanent BMP acceptable to the Borough, shall be used if infiltration
BMPs are deemed not feasible.
D. Design of BMPs used for water quality control shall be in accordance
with design specifications outlined in the Pennsylvania Stormwater
BMP Manual or other applicable manuals. The following factors must
be considered when evaluating the suitability of BMPs used to control
water quality at a given development site:
(1) Total contributing drainage area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Topographic slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
(8) Peak discharge and required volume control.

A. In addition to the water quality volume, to mitigate the impact of
stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion, BMPs must be
designed to detain the proposed conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour
design storm to the existing conditions one-year flow using the SCS
Type II distribution.
B. Whenever a watercourse is located within a development site, it shall
remain open in the natural state and location and shall not be piped,
impeded, or altered (except for road crossings). It is the responsibility
of the developer to stabilize all eroded stream/channel banks within a
subdivision or land development site and obtain all permits necessary
from PADEP, to do so. The developer must submit pictorial
documentation of existing stream/channel beds and banks to determine
whether existing banks must be stabilized.
A. Stormwater runoff which may result from regulated activities identified
in § 158-4 shall be controlled by permanent stormwater runoff BMPs
that will provide the required standards within Article III. The methods
of stormwater control or best management practices (BMPs) which may
be used to meet the required standards are described in this chapter
and the "Pennsylvania Stormwater best management practice Manual,"
December 30, 2006, as amended, and are the preferred methods of
controlling stormwater runoff. The choice of BMPs is not limited to the
ones appearing in this chapter and the Manual; however, any selected
BMP must meet or exceed the runoff peak rate requirements of this
chapter.
B. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
C. Collection system standards.
§ 158-16 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:373
(1) Curb inlets. Curb inlets shall be located at curb tangents on the
uphill side of street intersections, and at intervals along the curb
line to control the maximum amount of encroachment of runoff on
the roadway pavement so that same does not exceed a width of four
feet during the design storm event. Design and location of curb
inlets shall be approved by the Borough.
(2) Pipe materials. All storm sewer piping shall be either Class III
reinforced concrete pipe, except when pipe class and strength is
required to be increased in accordance with PennDOT
specification, or high-density polyethylene pipe. Piping shall be
saw-cut at ends, as needed, and not hammered or broken. All pipe
joints and lift holes must be mortared except where designed for
infiltration.
(3) Minimum pipe size. Minimum pipe diameter shall be 15 inches (or
an equivalent flow area of 1.23 square feet).
(4) Inlet and manhole construction. Inlet and manhole castings and
concrete construction shall be equivalent to PennDOT design
standards. Manhole castings and covers shall have the word
"STORM" cast in two-inch-high letters on the top of the cover. All
inlet grates shall be bicycle-safe heavy-duty structural steel. All
storm sewer inlets must be identified with a storm drain marker.
Storm drain markers shall be embossed into the inlet hood. Marker
shall have a minimum diameter of 3 1/2 inches and include "No
Dumping - Drains to Waterway" and a fish symbol. Alternate
designs/sizes may be used if approved by the Borough.
(5) Open end pipes must be fitted with concrete or high-density
polyethylene endwalls, flared end section, or wing walls in
accordance with PennDOT Standards.
(6) Flow velocity. Stormwater collection systems shall be designed to
produce a maximum permissible velocity of 15 feet per second.
Pipe slopes shall not be less than one half of one percent (0.005 ft/
ft), with the exception that sections of pipe used for infiltration may
have zero percent (0 ft/ft) if approved by the Borough.
(7) Inlets and manholes shall be spaced at intervals not exceeding 300
feet, and shall be located wherever branches are connected or sizes
are changed, and wherever there is a change in alignment or
grade. For drainage lines of at least 36 inches diameter, inlets and
manholes may be spaced at intervals of 400 feet.
(8) Storm sewer bedding/backfill requirements shall conform to the
Perkasie Borough Roadway Construction Standards and
Specifications, Chapter 160, Attachment 2, Section 4 (Storm
Sewer).
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:374
(9) Inlets shall be located to intercept concentrated runoff prior to
discharge over public/private rights-of-way, sidewalks, streets, and
driveways.
(10) The capacity of all Type 'C' inlets shall be based on a maximum
surface flow to the inlets of four cfs, calculated based on the onehundred-
year frequency design storm event. The maximum flow to
Type 'C' inlets located in low points (such as sag vertical curves)
shall include the overland flow directed to the inlet as well as all
bypass runoff from upstream inlets. The bypass flow from upstream
inlets shall be calculated using inlet efficiency curves included in
PennDOT Design Manual Part 2, latest edition. If the surface flow to
an inlet exceeds four cfs, additional inlets shall be provided
upstream of the inlet to intercept the excessive surface flow. A Type
'C' inlet at a low point of a paved area may be designed to accept a
maximum of six cubic feet per second (CFS). Type 'M' inlets shall
be designed to accept a maximum surface flow of six CFS based on
the one-hundred-year frequency design storm event, unless
otherwise approved by the Borough. Double inlets will not be
permitted where additional pipe and inlets can be placed upstream
to intercept excessive surface flow. A maximum of 12 cfs shall be
permitted to be collected by a Type 'M' inlet located in an isolated
pervious area provided the designer can verify that such an inlet
would not cause stormwater to accumulate on any adjoining public
or private property, outside of a storm sewer easement, and that
the depth of the accumulated stormwater would not exceed 12
inches.
(11) A minimum drop of two inches shall be provided between the inlet
and outlet pipe invert elevations within all inlets and manholes.
When varying pipe sizes enter an inlet or manhole, the elevation of
crown of all pipes shall be matched. Storm sewer pipes shall enter
and exit the sides of inlet boxes and shall not encroach into the
corner, wherever possible.
(12) Stormwater pipes shall have a minimum depth of cover of 18 inches
(including over the bell) or as designated by the American Concrete
Pipe Association (whichever is greater), and in no case shall any
part of the pipe project into the road subbase or curb. Where cover
is restricted, equivalent pipe arches may be specified in lieu of
circular pipe, to achieve required cover. Stormwater pipes
conveying swale flow under driveway crossings shall have a
minimum cover of 12 inches, including over the bell, but in no case
shall the cover be less than that required for the anticipated traffic
loading. For driveway culverts, cover may be less than 12 inches if
the design engineer verifies proposed pipe has sufficient strength
to withstand loading from anticipated design vehicles. Where cover
is restricted, concrete trench drain with bolt-down metal grates
may be used.
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:375
(13) The capacity of all stormwater pipes shall be calculated utilizing
the Manning Equation for open channel flow as applied to closed
conduit flow. The Manning's roughness coefficient shall be 0.13 for
all concrete pipe and 0.12 for all high-density polyethylene (HDPE)
pipe. In cases where pressure flow may occur, the hydraulic grade
line shall be calculated throughout the storm sewer system to
verify that at least one foot of freeboard will be provided in all inlets
and manholes for the design storm event.
(14) Culverts shall be designed based on procedures contained in
Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts, HDS #5, U.S. Department
of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Where
pressure flow is anticipated in storm sewer pipes (non-open
channel flow), the applicant's designer shall be required to
calculate the elevation of the hydraulic grade line through the
storm sewer system. Wherever the hydraulic grade line elevation
exceeds the pipe crown elevation for the design flow, pipes with
watertight joints must be specified.
(15) Storm sewer structures (e.g., endwalls, inlets, pipe sections, etc.)
may not be located on top of, or within 10 feet of electric,
communication, water, sanitary sewer, or gas services and/or
mains, and structures, unless approval is received from the
Borough and the authority or utility having jurisdiction over same.
(16) Stormwater pipes must be oriented at right angles to electric,
water, sanitary sewer, and gas utilities when crossing above or
beneath same. Crossing angles of less than 90° will only be
permitted at the discretion of the Borough. When skewed crossings
are permitted, interior angles between alignment of the storm
sewer pipe and utility may not be less than 45°. Vertical and
horizontal design of storm sewer must be linear.
(17) Roadway underdrain is required along both sides of all proposed
roadways, existing roadways proposed to be widened, and within
existing or proposed roadside swales as directed by the Borough
Engineer.
(18) Where a public storm sewer system is not located within a right-ofway,
or dedicated public property, a twenty-foot-wide easement
shall be established to encompass the storm sewer system. For
multiple pipes or utilities, the width of the easement shall be a
minimum of 30 feet.
(19) A minimum of one foot of freeboard, between the inlet grate and
the design flow elevation, shall be provided in all storm sewer
systems (inlets and manholes) for the one-hundred-year frequency
design storm event.
(20) Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge water directly onto a
sidewalk or a street and shall be constructed to discharge above
ground entirely on the subject property, except where such
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:376
discharge could flow across sidewalk or onto a street. If approved
by the Borough Engineer, roof drains may be discharged directly
to a storm sewer system if such system discharges to a stormwater
BMP or water quality facility.
D. Open swales and gutters. Open swales shall be designed on the basis of
Manning's Formula as indicated for collection systems with the
following considerations:
(1) Roughness coefficient. The roughness coefficient shall be 0.040 for
earth swales.
(2) Bank slopes. Slopes for swale banks shall not be steeper than one
vertical to three horizontal.
(3) Flow velocity. The maximum velocity of flow as determined by
Manning's equation shall not exceed the allowable velocities as
shown in the following table for the specific type of material, unless
otherwise approved by the Borough and the Bucks County
Conservation District
Note: Source of the following design criteria is the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Soil
and Water Conservation Publication, Erosion and Sediment

(4) Swales shall be stabilized with biodegradable erosion control
blanket to permit establishment of permanent vegetation. Swales
shall be of such shape and size to effectively contain the onehundred-
year, Rational Method design storm, or greater, and to
conform to all other specifications of the Borough.
(5) To minimize sheet flow of stormwater across lots located on the
lower side of roads or streets, and to divert flow away from building
areas, the cross-section of the street as constructed shall provide
for parallel ditches or swales or curb on the lower side which shall
discharge only at drainage easements, unless otherwise approved
by the Borough.
(6) Gutters and swales adjacent to road paving shall be permitted to
carry a maximum flow of four cubic feet per second prior to
discharge away from the street surface, unless it is proven to the
satisfaction of the Borough by engineering calculations that the
road slopes or other factors would allow higher gutter or swale
capacity.
(7) Flows larger than those permitted in gutters and roadside swales
may be conveyed in swales outside the required road right-of-way
in separate drainage easements, or may be conveyed in pipes or
culverts inside or outside the required road right-of-way.
(8) Existing and proposed swales shall be provided with underdrains
as deemed necessary by the Borough should overland seepage
result in potential maintenance problems. Underdrains must
discharge into a natural drainage channel or stormwater
management system.
(9) Where drainage swales are used to divert surface waters away
from buildings, they shall be sodded, landscaped, or otherwise
protected as required and shall be of a slope, shape, and size
conforming to the requirements of the Borough. Concentration of
surface water runoff shall be permitted only in swales,
watercourses, retention or detention basins, bioretention areas, or
other areas designed to meet the objectives of this chapter.
(10) Except for drainage at roadway stream crossings, artificial swale
discharge shall be set back 75 feet from a receiving waterway, and
shall be diffused or spread out to reduce and eliminate highvelocity
discharges to the impacted ground surface.
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:378
E. Bridge and culvert design. Any proposed bridge or culvert to convey
flow within a watercourse, perennial stream, intermittent stream or
ephemeral stream shall be designed in accordance with the following
principals:
(1) Culverts and bridges shall be designed with an open bottom to
maintain natural sediment transport and bed roughness, avoiding
acceleration of water velocity above the natural (preexisting)
condition. Rock (rip rap) lining (native material if possible) shall be
installed within the culvert as needed to prevent erosion within the
structure. Approximate top of rock lining must be at the level of the
existing stream bottom so as to maintain unimpeded movement of
native animal species and a normal water depth of 12 inches unless
a greater depth is required by PADEP.
(2) Bottom of opening shall be designed to match the bankfull channel
condition in terms of width and depth. The cross-sectional area of
the bankfull channel (measured at a reference location upstream of
the structure) shall be matched with area in the crossing structure.
(3) Above the bankfull elevation, the width shall increase a minimum of
30% to disperse the energy of higher flow volumes and avoid
undermining of the supporting structure by secondary currents.
(4) The total cross-sectional area of the structure opening must be
equal to or greater than the flood-prone area (cross-sectional
stream area at a depth of twice the maximum bankfull depth,
measured at a reference location upstream of the structure). The
flood prone area is approximately equal to the area flooded by a
fifty-year return period flood.
(5) All bridges, culverts, and drainage channels shall be designed to
convey a flow rate equal to a one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
storm as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service, Technical Release No. 55. All bridges and
culverts shall be designed to convey the one-hundred-year design
storm without increasing the extent and depth of the one-hundredyear
floodplain, upstream or downstream of the structure.
F. Storm sewer design.
(1) Design flow rate. The storm sewer system shall be designed to
carry the one-hundred-year frequency design storm peak flow rate.
The drainage area and runoff coefficient to each inlet shall be
indicated on the stormwater management plan. The one-hundredyear
flow rate shall be determined by the Rational Method formula:
Q = CIA
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:379
Where:
Q = Peak runoff rate measured in cubic feet per second
(cfs)
C = Runoff coefficient - The coefficient of stormwater
runoff includes many variables, such as ground
slope, ground cover, shape of drainage area, etc.
I = Intensity  Average rainfall intensity in inches per
hour for a time equal to the time of concentration
A = Area  Drainage area in acres
Values for the rainfall intensity shall be based on NOAA Atlas 14,
Volume 2, Version 3.0, rain data found in Table A-3 and Figure A-2
of Appendix A of this chapter.
(2) Consideration shall be given to future land use changes in the
drainage area in selecting the Rational ("C") coefficient. For
drainage areas containing several different types of ground cover, a
weighted value of "C" shall be used.
(3) In determining the peak flow rate to individual storm sewer inlets
(or other collection structures) the time of concentration method
(as referenced in § 158-19) shall be used for inlet drainage areas in
excess of one acre, unless otherwise approved by the Borough. For
inlet drainage areas less than one acre, a five-minute time of
concentration shall be used unless otherwise approved by the
Borough.
(4) In determining the required design flow rate through a storm
sewer piping system, if a five-minute time of concentration (storm
duration) results in a pipe size exceeding a thirty-inch diameter
pipe (or equivalent flow area of 4.9 square feet), the time of
concentration approach (as defined herein) shall be used in
determining storm duration.
(5) In determining the required design flow rate through a storm
sewer piping system, if a five-minute time of concentration results
in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches, within any run of pipe, the time
of concentration approach may be used for sizing of pipes from that
point on, by adjusting the time of concentration.
(6) Overflow system. An overflow system shall be provided to carry all
bypass flow and/or flow in excess of storm sewer pipe design
capacity, to the detention basin (or other approved outlet point)
when the capacity of the system is exceeded. Stormwater runoff
will not be permitted to surcharge from storm sewer structures
[refer to § 158-18C(19)].
(7) Except for drainage at roadway stream crossings, pipe discharge
shall be set back 75 feet from a receiving waterway, and the pipe
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:380
discharge shall be diffused or spread out to reduce and eliminate
high-velocity discharges to the impacted ground surface.
G. Grading and drainage.
(1) After completion of rough grading, a minimum of eight inches of
topsoil shall be returned to remaining disturbed areas prior to final
grading and seeding.
(2) Blocks and lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage away
from buildings and to prevent the collection of storm water in
pools. Minimum two-percent slopes shall be maintained away from
and around all structures. Separation between the top of
foundation wall (or slab) and final grade shall comply with Perkasie
Borough Building Code requirements.
(3) Construction. The developer shall construct and/or install such
drainage structures and/or pipe which are necessary to prevent
erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off such surface waters
to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural water course.
(4) Excavation. No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in
slope than four horizontal to one vertical (4:1 = 25%), except under
one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope of steeper than 4:1 and a written
statement (certification) from a professional civil engineer,
licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
experienced in erosion control, to this effect is submitted to the
Borough Engineer for review. This statement shall indicate the
site has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope
specified herein will not result in injury to persons or damage
to property.
(b) A concrete, segmental block, or stone masonry wall,
constructed in accordance with Borough requirements, is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
(5) Fill. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than four horizontal to one vertical (4:1 = 25%)
except under one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The fill is located so that settlement, sliding, or erosion will not
result in property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property,
streets, alleys, or buildings.
(b) A written statement from a professional civil engineer, licensed
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in
erosion control, certifying the site has been inspected and that
the proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:381
endanger any property or result in property damage, is
submitted to and approved by the Borough.
(c) A concrete, segmental block, or stone masonry wall,
constructed in accordance with Borough requirements, is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
(6) Slopes and fences. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a
minimum of five feet from property or right-of-way lines of streets
or alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property. Where walls or slopes
(steeper than two horizontal to one vertical) are approved under
the criteria in this chapter, and are four feet or more in height, a
protective fence, no less than four feet in height, shall be required
at the top of the wall (or bank).
(7) Clean up. All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances
whatsoever during construction.
(8) Design of erosion and sedimentation control facilities (particularly
stormwater/sediment basins) shall incorporate best management
practices as defined herein.
(9) Cut and fill operations shall be kept to a minimum. Wherever
feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and
supplemented. Cut and fills shall not endanger or otherwise
adversely impact adjoining property.
(10)No grading equipment shall be permitted to be loaded and/or
unloaded on a public street, and no grading equipment shall be
permitted to travel on or across a public street unless licensed for
operation on public thoroughfares.
(11) Grading equipment shall not be permitted to cross intermittent and
perennial streams. Temporary crossing shall only be permitted
where application is made, and approval is received, from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (where
applicable), the Bucks County Conservation District, and Perkasie
Borough.
(12) Design of energy dissipation for high volume and/or high velocity
discharge from storm sewer pipes and channels shall be in
accordance with Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 14,
"Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipaters for Culverts and
Channels" as published by Department of Transportation, FHA,
when deemed necessary by the Borough, and as approved by the
Bucks County Conservation District.
(13) To control the dissemination of mud and dirt on to public roads and
driveways, tire cleaning areas constructed of AASHTO #1 stone
(underlain by geotextile structural fabric), at least 50 feet in length,
shall be installed at each point of access to the site and individual
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:382
lots (upon construction of internal streets in a binder condition).
When deemed necessary by the Borough, washing stations shall
also be set-up at every construction entrance in order to wash
mud and dirt from exiting vehicles. Appropriate measures must be
taken to control runoff from such locations. The developer shall be
responsible for the placement of appropriate signage identifying
construction entrances and washing stations. Construction
entrances shall be maintained by the developer during
construction, as determined by the Borough.
(14) In the event any mud and/or debris is transported from the site
onto a public roadway, the debris shall be removed immediately
and the roadway swept and/or washed as deemed necessary by the
Borough at the owner's expense.
(15) Adequate provision shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavation and the sloping surfaces of
fills.
H. Stormwater detention/retention basins.
(1) If permanent ponds (retention basin) are proposed, the developer
shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed to protect the
public's health and safety. Should any stormwater management
facility require a dam safety permit under the PADEP Chapter 105
regulations, the facility shall be designed in accordance with
Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning
dam safety which may be required to pass storms larger than a onehundred-
year event.
(2) During construction, duly authorized representatives of Perkasie
Borough may enter at any reasonable time upon any property
within the Borough to investigate whether construction activity is
in compliance with this chapter.
(3) When basins are provided, they shall be designed to utilize the
natural contours of the land whenever possible. When such design
is not practical, the construction of the basin shall utilize slopes as
flat as possible to blend the structure into the terrain. To minimize
the visual impact of detention basins, they shall be designed to
avoid the need for safety fencing. To meet this requirement,
detention basins shall be designed as follows:
(a) Maximum depth of detained runoff shall be 24 inches for a twoyear
or ten-year storm event.
(b) Maximum depth of detained runoff shall be 36 inches for a onehundred-
year storm event.
(c) The basin inflow and outflow structures shall not be located
directly across from each other and shall not be in close
proximity to one another. A length-to-width ratio in all
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:383
detention/retention basins and other such storage facilities
of at least 2:1 shall be provided to maximize the flow path
between the inflow point and the outlet structure. The distance
between these two structures must be at least 50% of the
maximum length of the basin as measured at the top of berm
elevation. Alternatively, a means for extending the time of
surface flow from basin inflow point to basin outlet structure,
designed to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer, may be
utilized.
(4) Landscaping and planting in and around the perimeter of basins
shall be provided. Proposed planting shall also be in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance,105 and as recommended by the Borough
Engineer. When a detention basin is not designed as a stormwater
management constructed wetland, it shall be planted with lowmaintenance
grass or similar satisfactory to the Borough.
(5) If a stormwater management basin will serve as a temporary
sediment control device, the temporary sediment control measures
shall be shown including perforated riser pipes or standboxes, filter
berms, clean-out stakes and other measures as may be required by
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Chapter
102 Regulations. Plans for such facilities shall require Bucks
County Conservation District approval prior to implementation.
Sedimentation basins shall be in place prior to any earthmoving
activities within their tributary drainage areas. A note identifying
the above criteria shall be on all plan sheets required to be
recorded as well as the development agreement with the Borough
and the stormwater management facilities operation and
maintenance agreement.
(6) As-built drawings of the stormwater management basins(s) shall be
submitted to the Borough for review. The basin shall not be
considered functional until it is proved by the developer that the
basin meets the volume requirements and the outflow
characteristics of the original design of the basin(s).
(7) Runoff shall not be directed to any infiltration structure until all
tributary drainage areas are permanently stabilized.
(8) Except where otherwise identified herein, all detention or retention
basins shall have slopes of four horizontal to one vertical (4:1 =
25%), or flatter on the basin's outer berm and five horizontal to one
vertical or less on the basin's inner berm. The top or toe of any
slope shall be located a minimum of five feet from any property
line. The maximum difference between the top of berm elevation
and the invert elevation of the outlet structure shall be seven feet.
105. Editor's Note: See Ch. 164, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:384
(9) All portions of a detention basin bottom shall have a minimum slope
of 2%. For portions of basin bottoms with grades less than 2%, the
applicant shall provide a landscape design which minimizes
maintenance provisions and encourages infiltration. These
requirements may be altered when approved by the Borough
Engineer.
(10) Basin berm construction requirements.
(a) Site preparation. Areas under the embankment and any
structural works shall be cleared, grubbed, and the topsoil
stripped to remove the trees, vegetation, roots or other
objectionable material. In order to facilitate clean-out and
restoration, the pool area will be cleared of all brush and
excess trees except where designed to retain such existing
vegetation as stormwater BMPs.
(b) Cut off trench. A cut-off trench will be excavated along the
centerline dam on earth fill embankments. The minimum depth
shall be two feet. The cut-off trench shall extend up both
abutments to the riser crest elevation. The minimum bottom
width shall be eight feet but wide enough to permit operation
of compaction equipment. The side slopes shall be no steeper
than 1:1. Compaction requirements shall be the same as those
for the embankment. The trench shall be kept free from
standing water during the backfilling operations.
(c) Embankment:
[1] The fill material shall be taken from the selected borrow
areas. It shall be free of roots, wood vegetation, oversized
stones, rocks or other objectionable material. Areas on
which fill is to be placed shall be scarified prior to
placement of fill.
[2] The fill material should contain sufficient moisture so that
it can be formed by hand into a ball without crumbling. If
water can be squeezed out of the ball, it is too wet for
proper compaction.
[3] Fill material will be placed in six- to eight-inch layers and
shall be continuous over the entire length of the fill. Fill
material must be compacted to a minimum of 95% of
Modified Proctor Density as established by ASTM D-1557.
Compaction testing by a certified soils engineer/geologist
must be completed as directed by the Borough Engineer to
verify adequate compaction has been achieved.
Compaction tests shall be run on the leading and trailing
edge of the berm along with the top of the berm.
Verification of required compaction shall be submitted to
the Borough prior to utilization of any basin for
stormwater management.
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:385
(11) Emergency overflow facilities/spillway shall be provided within
basins in order to convey basin inflow in excess of design flows, out
of the basin, or in the event the outlet structure becomes blocked
and is unable to convey flow. Emergency spillways discharging over
embankments shall be constructed of an approved liner to protect
the berm against erosion. Design calculations shall be provided to
the Borough demonstrating that the liner is sufficient to handle up
to and including the design storm. The approved lining shall extend
to the toe of the embankment on the outside of the berm, and shall
extend to an elevation of three feet below the spillway crest on the
inside of the berm. Vegetated spillways may be utilized for
spillways constructed entirely on undisturbed ground (i.e., not
discharging over fill material). A dense cover of vegetation shall be
rapidly established in such spillways by sodding or seeding with a
geotextile anchor. The vegetated spillway must be stabilized before
runoff is directed to the basin. The minimum capacity of all
emergency spillways shall be equivalent to the peak flow rate of the
one-hundred-year, post-development design storm (entering to the
basin).
(12) In all cases, the discharge end of the basin shall be provided with a
properly designed outlet control structure (headwall, orifice
structure or other approved flow control structure), culvert pipe,
and endwall. Perforated riser pipes alone, without provision for
permanent outlet control structure (as stated above), and culvert
pipe are not permitted for permanent basins.
(13) The minimum top of basin berm width (at the design elevation)
shall be 10 feet.
(14) The minimum freeboard through the emergency spillway shall be
one foot. "Freeboard" is defined as the difference between the
design flow elevation through the spillway and the elevation of the
top of the settled basin berm.
(15) Anti-seep collars shall be installed around the pipe barrel and shall
be centered within the normal saturation zone of the berm. The
anti-seep collars and their connections to the pipe barrel shall be
watertight. The anti-seep collars shall be cast-in-place in the field
and extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the
principal pipe barrel. Precast collars shall be permitted if approved
by the Borough Engineer. A minimum of two collars shall be
installed on each basin outlet pipe. Collars shall have a minimum
thickness of 12 inches and may not be installed within two feet of
pipe joints.
(16) A perforated sediment control structure, sized in accordance with
Bucks County Conservation District requirements, shall be
provided at each basin outlet structure (if more than one is to be
utilized) for sediment control. Sediment control structures shall not
be removed until the entire area tributary to the basin has been
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:386
permanently stabilized and until approved by the Bucks County
Conservation District.
(17) Stormwater management facility outlet piping shall be Class III
reinforced O-ring concrete pipe. All joints shall be mortared.
Crushed stone bedding/backfill shall not be utilized through basin
berms.
(18) The top of the basin outflow control structure box (emergency
overflow grate) shall be at least six inches lower than the elevation
of the earthen emergency spillway. Six inches, minimum, is also
required between the one-hundred-year water surface elevation
and the emergency overflow grate on the basin outflow control
structure.
(19) Energy dissipating devices (rock lining/rip rap, or other approved
materials) shall be provided at all basin outlets and shall be sized in
accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation Publication,
Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual, latest
revision.
(20) Stone gabion baskets or concrete or segmental block retaining
walls shall not be permitted for use in construction of detention/
retention basins within the berm or within the one-hundred-year
water surface elevation (as measured through the earthen
emergency spillway).
(21) Access easement and stabilized drive to stormwater detention
facilities shall be provided for maintenance and operation. This
access easement shall be cleared and, when possible, be at least 20
feet in width. Multiple accesses shall be encouraged for major
facilities. The developer shall provide access easements and drives
of interlocked, reinforced pervious paving systems (back-filled with
topsoil and seeded) or other similar paver acceptable to the
Borough Engineer, over a six-inch bed of compacted PennDOT type
3A coarse aggregate (or approved equivalent). Accessways to
basins shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide and be no steeper in
slope than 10 feet horizontal to one foot vertical (10:1). In addition,
depressed curb and reinforced concrete apron (six-inch minimum
thickness) shall be provided where the accessway enters a street/
driveway and the stabilized driveway shall extend from the bottom
of the interior basin berm embankment to the point of access to the
basin from a public right-of-way or paved driveway within an access
easement. Access easement shall be owned and maintained by the
individual lot owner(s) or homeowner's association but shall be
established to permit access by Perkasie Borough or its designee,
for emergency inspection and/or maintenance, at any reasonable
time.
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:387
(22) If the basin is not designed to meet the requirements of
§ 158-18H(3), a split rail fence must be provided as follows:
(a) A level area (two-percent slope) eight feet in width shall be
provided on both the inside and outside of the fence, along the
entire length of the fence for proper access by maintenance
equipment. The total width of this generally level area shall be
at least 16 feet.
(b) Each basin fence installation shall include two points of access
with ten-foot-wide self-closing, self-latch gates to allow for
maintenance equipment/vehicle access.
(c) Fence shall be split-rail consisting of locust posts (two or three
rail), four feet high, minimum, with assorted hardwood rails
(eight feet to 10 feet long), and epoxy-coated wire mesh (black
or green in color) installed six inches above finished grade. The
mesh shall be installed on the outside of the fence.
(d) Split rail fence shall also be required around any detention or
retention basin, where directed by Perkasie Borough.
(23) Landscaping:
(a) The perimeter berms and embankments of retention/detention
basins including wet ponds and artificial wetland stormwater
management BMPs shall be designed to create a natural
appearance and reduce future maintenance requirements.
Landscaping shall include a mixture of native tall grasses and
perennial plants, ground cover, shrubs, and trees to eliminate
the necessity of periodic mowing.
(b) Artificial wetland basins shall be designed pursuant to
requirements of the Pennsylvania Stormwater BMP Manual.
Plant material and arrangement shall be subject to approval of
the Borough Engineer.
(c) Required planting.
[1] The perimeter of the retention/detention basin shall be
landscaped with a mixture of deciduous trees, evergreens,
and shrubs arranged in an informal manner. Retention
basin (wet ponds) and artificial wetland basin landscaping
shall be designed to create a "natural" appearance.
Minimum plant material shall include the following per
100 linear feet of basin perimeter measured at the onehundred-
year water surface elevation:
[a] Three evergreen trees (minimum height five feet).
[b] Two deciduous trees (minimum caliper 2 1/2 inches).
[c] Five shrubs (minimum height three feet).
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:388
[2] Retention/detention basin landscaping design is subject to
approval by the Borough.
(24) Special requirements for stormwater detention/retention BMPs
within defined exceptional-value and high-quality watersheds as
defined in Chapter 93, Water Quality Standards, Title 25,
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Rules and
Regulations:
(a) Temperature-sensitive BMPs and stormwater conveyance
systems are to be used and designed with storage pool areas
and supply outflow channels, and shaded with trees. At a
minimum, the southern half of pond shorelines shall be planted
with shade or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond
shoreline. In conjunction with this requirement, the maximum
slope allowed on the berm area to be planted is 10 to one. This
will lessen the destabilization of berm soils due to root growth.
A long-term maintenance schedule and management plan for
the thermal control BMPs must be identified on the stormwater
management site plan and recorded at the Bucks County
Recorder of Deeds for all development sites.
(b) As an alternative to mitigating the temperature of stormwater
runoff as described in § 158-18H(25)(a), alternative
temperature-sensitive BMPs may be utilized, if approved by the
Borough Engineer, upon the applicant demonstrating such
BMPs will effectively reduce the temperature of detained
runoff before it is released from the development site. Such
alternative BMPs may include, but are not limited to, facilities
that cool runoff through underground storage and filtration
and retention ponds/basins where outflow from the facility is
drawn from a depth of five feet (or greater) below the
permanent pool surface.
(25) The developer shall provide written assurance, satisfactory to the
Borough, that the retention/detention basin will be properly
maintained. Such assurances shall be in a form to act as a covenant
that will run with the land, and shall provide Borough maintenance
at the cost of the landowner in case of default, and further provide
for assessment of costs and penalties in case of default.
(26) As an alternate to the above subsection, the Borough may, at their
own option, assume responsibility of the basin and may accept
dedication of the basin by the developer. If the retention/detention
basin is dedicated or offered to the Borough for long-term
maintenance, the following regulations shall apply:
(a) The dedicated area shall include the entire ponded area for the
one-hundred-year storm event and the outside slope at the
berm.
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:389
(b) The dedicated area shall not be considered part of the open
space and recreation land required elsewhere in the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and Zoning
Ordinance.106
(c) The developer shall provide for the special financial burden the
Borough will be accepting if the Borough accepts the detention
basin maintenance. To help mitigate this future financial
burden, the developer shall contribute to the Borough a cash
payment in the amount established by resolution of the Council
for any detention/retention basin site or area dedicated to the
Borough and being accepted by the Borough.
I. All developments which create impervious surface shall provide
capacity for and treatment of the water quality volume and recharge
volume, unless exempt from applicability under § 158-5. Developers
shall utilize BMPs to provide for additional water quality improvement
and groundwater recharge. In evaluating potential stormwater BMPs,
the order of preference is as follows: (1) infiltration BMPs; (2) flow
attenuation methods (e.g., vegetated open swales and natural
depressions); (3) artificial wetlands, bioretention structures, and wet
ponds; (4) minimum first flush detention or dual purpose detention
(where appropriate). Infiltration BMPs shall be utilized unless the
applicant can demonstrate use of infiltration techniques is not feasible
due to site conditions based upon site specific soil testing. Vegetated
swales, wetlands or artificial wetlands and bioretention structures shall
be utilized wherever possible if infiltration BMPs are deemed
unfeasible. BMP techniques can and should be used in conjunction with
each other (e.g., vegetated swales with infiltration or retention
facilities).
(1) Infiltration best management practices (BMPs). Infiltration BMPs
shall be designed in accordance with the design criteria and
specifications of the Pennsylvania Stormwater BMP Manual (2006)
and shall conform to the following minimum requirements:
(a) A soils evaluation and infiltration/permeability testing of the
project site shall be conducted in accordance with Appendix B
of this chapter.107
(b) A minimum soil depth of 24 inches shall be provided between
the bottom of the infiltration BMPs and the top of bedrock or
seasonally high water table. The minimum required separation
between the infiltration surface and these limiting zones shall
be increased by the Borough should project specific conditions
exist (such as anticipated increased contaminants) which
dictate greater prevention of groundwater contamination.

§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:390
(c) Infiltration BMPs must have an infiltration rate sufficient to
accept the design stormwater load and dewater completely as
determined by field permeability tests. The minimum fieldtested
infiltration rate permitted for construction of infiltration
BMPs shall be 0.2 inches/hour (in/hr). A safety factor of 50%
shall be applied to field-tested rates to determine the
infiltration rate that must be utilized for design of infiltration
BMPs (e.g., for soil which measured 0.4 in/hr, the BMP design
rate shall be 0.2 in/hr to insure effective infiltration after
construction).
(d) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive rooftop runoff shall
include appropriate measures such as leaf traps and cleanouts
to prevent clogging by vegetation. Surface inflows shall be
designed to prevent direct discharge of sediment into the
infiltration system.
(e) Adequate storage shall be provided to accommodate the
volume of runoff calculated as the difference between the
predevelopment runoff volume and post-development runoff
volume based on the one-hundred-year design storm.
(f) The facility shall be designed to control the post-development
peak rate of runoff to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff
for all design storms identified in § 158-13 of this chapter.
(g) An overflow or spillway shall be provided that safely permits
the passing of runoff greater than that occurring during the
one-hundred-year design storm event.
(h) Underground infiltration basins and BMPs shall have positive
overflow controls to prevent storage within one foot of the
finished surface over the basin.
(i) When infiltration methods such as seepage pits, beds, or
trenches are proposed, the locations of existing and proposed
septic tanks, infiltration areas, and wells must be shown. A
separation distance of no less than 50 feet shall be provided
between any septic system and any facility used for
stormwater management and infiltration.
(j) A minimum of 10 feet of undisturbed soil shall separate the
foundation wall of any building and an infiltration BMP.
(k) All infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely
infiltrate runoff volume within four days (96 hours) from the
peak of the design storm.
(l) Special attention shall be paid to proper installation of
infiltration-oriented stormwater management systems during
the construction and to careful avoidance of soil compaction
during site development. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:391
shall be protected from sedimentation and compaction during
the construction phase, so as to maintain their maximum
infiltration capacity.
(m) The Borough may require the installation of a mitigative layer
or an impermeable liner in an infiltration BMP and/or other
stormwater structure that impounds runoff, where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A detailed
hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the Borough.
(n) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff
until the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration
BMP has achieved final stabilization.
(o) Infiltration BMPs shall be designed based on field-tested
infiltration/permeability rates at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface(s) and based on a safety factor of 50%.
(2) Non-infiltration facilities used as best management practices
(BMPs). All facilities shall be designed in accordance to the design
criteria and specifications in the Pennsylvania Stormwater BMP
Manual.
(3) Artificial wetlands, wet ponds, and bioretention structures.
(a) Wet pond BMPs shall meet the following requirements:
[1] Wet ponds shall be constructed on hydric or wet soils and/
or soils which have an infiltration rate of less than 0.2
inches/hour.
[2] A minimum drainage area of five acres shall be directed to
the pond unless a source of recharge is utilized such as a
natural spring or well.
[3] The length of the pond between the inflow and outlet
points shall be maximized. In addition, an irregular
shoreline shall be provided. By maximizing the flow length
through the pond and providing an irregular shoreline, the
greatest water quality benefit will be achieved by
minimizing "short circuiting" of runoff flowing through the
pond.
[4] A shallow forebay shall be provided adjacent to all inflow
areas. The forebay shall be planted as a marsh with
emergent wetland vegetation. The forebay serves to
enhance sediment trapping and pollutant removal, as well
as concentrating accumulated sediment in an area where
it can be readily removed.
[5] All wet ponds shall be designed with public safety as a
primary concern. An aquatic safety bench shall be
provided around the perimeter of the permanent pool. The
§ 158-18 PERKASIE CODE § 158-18
152:392
depth of the bench shall be a maximum of 15 inches and a
minimum of 12 inches for a width of at least 10 feet. A 3:1
slope shall lead from the edge of the safety bench toward
the deep water portion of the pond. At least 15 feet of 3:1
slope shall be provided from the edge of the safety bench.
Slopes in the remainder of the pond below the permanent
pool elevation shall be a maximum of 2:1.
[6] The perimeter slope above the permanent pool shall have a
maximum slope of 5:1.
[7] Wet ponds shall have a deep water zone of at least five feet
to encourage gravity settling of suspended fines, and
prevent stagnation and possible eutrophication.
[8] Wet ponds shall be capable of being substantially drained
by gravity flow. Wet ponds shall be equipped with a
manually operated drain that can be secured against
unauthorized operation.
[9] A planting plan shall be developed for the wet pond,
showing all proposed aquatic, emergent, and upland
plantings required pursuant to this chapter and the Zoning
and Subdivision and Land Development Ordinances
(where specifically identified).108
[10]Wet ponds shall be designed to discourage use by Canada
geese. Techniques employed shall include the following:
[a] Elimination of straight shorelines, islands, and
peninsulas;
[b] Placement of walking paths (where applicable) along
the shoreline;
[c] Placement of grassed areas (i.e., playing fields) at
least 450 feet from the water surface;
[d] Vegetative barriers;
[e] Rock barriers;
[f] Installation of tall trees within 10 feet of the water
surface;
[g] Use of ground covers not palatable to Canada geese;
[h] Other techniques as approved by the Borough
Engineer.
(b) Artificial wetland BMPs shall meet the following requirements:
108. Editor's Note: See Ch. 164, Subdivision and Land Development, and Ch. 186, Zoning,
respectively.
§ 158-18 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-18
152:393
[1] Artificial wetlands shall be constructed on hydric or wet
soils and/or soils which have an infiltration rate of less
than 0.2 inches/hour.
[2] Runoff entering artificial wetlands shall be filtered through
a sediment removal device before entering the wetland.
[3] A planting plan shall be developed for the artificial wetland
showing all proposed aquatic, emergent, and upland
plantings required pursuant to this chapter and the Zoning
and Subdivision and Land Development Ordinances
(where specifically identified).109 The planting plan shall
be developed to provide a diversity of species resulting in a
dense stand of wetland vegetation.
[4] At least 75% of the surface area of the wetland shall be
developed as a shallow water emergent wetland, with a
water depth of less than 12 inches. The reminder shall be
constructed as open water with depths between two feet
and four feet.
(4) Minimum first flush detention/dual purpose BMPs.
(a) Minimum first flush detention/dual purpose detention basin
BMPs shall be designed to meet the following requirements:
[1] Post-development runoff from a "water quality storm" (a
one-year, twenty-four-hour event) shall be released over a
minimum period of 24 hours.
[2] Two stage basins shall be utilized where first flush
detention will be employed for water quality and
conventional detention used for peak rate control of
storms exceeding the one-year, twenty-four-hour event.
[3] Two stage basins shall be constructed so that the lower
part of the basin is graded to detain stormwater from the
"water quality storm," and the remainder of the basin
graded as a flat overbank area to provide storage only for
the larger, less frequent storm events. The overbank area
is encouraged to be developed as an active or passive
recreational area.
[4] The area inundated by the "water quality storm" is
encouraged to be maintained as a wetland environment,
which will increase the water quality benefits of the first
flush/dual purpose detention basin, and will prevent the
need for mowing of a frequently saturated area.

J. Riparian corridor restoration. Within all major subdivisions and
nonresidential land developments, from the top of watercourse bank,
75 feet on either side of the watercourse, which contains wetlands and/
or floodplain, shall be planted to establish a Zone 1 and Zone 2 buffer in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Handbook of best management
practices for Developing Areas, 1998, Riparian Forested Buffer. Where
existing vegetation on the site essentially duplicates buffer
requirements, this provision shall not apply. Additionally, this
requirement may be modified or waived by Borough Council where
existing man-made improvements or agricultural operations to be
retained encroach within the buffer area.
K. General design requirements.
(1) Prior to finish grading of a development site and final overlay of
streets, roads, and driveways, temporary measures, acceptable to
the Borough, shall be taken to ensure that all runoff intended to be
intercepted and collected by an inlet or other facility will be
collected. The plan shall include such details, notes, or
specification including bituminous "eyebrows" at inlets, diversion
berms, etc.
(2) Water originating from other than natural sources, such as air
conditioning units, sump pumps, or other dry weather flow,
wherever practical and possible, shall be connected to a
stormwater management BMP or stormwater conveyance facility
that is designed as part of a stormwater management BMP.
(3) All stormwater runoff and floodplain calculations and stormwater
management facilities design shall be prepared by a professional
engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(4) When subdivisions or land developments are submitted to the
Borough for approval in sections, a complete storm sewer design
for the proposed subdivision and land development shall be
submitted. The proposed design must include the entire tract and
not a portion.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Borough shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the occupancy or continuation of an adverse
hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed.
L. All stormwater control facility designs shall conform to the applicable
standards and specifications of the following governmental and
institutional agencies:
(1) American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM).
(2) Asphalt Institute (AI).

B. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return period storms according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0,
rain data corresponding to the Perkasie, Pennsylvania rain gage, as
presented in Table A-1 of Appendix A of this chapter.110 The SCS Type II
rainfall curve data from NOAA is listed in Figure A-1 in Appendix A of
this chapter. This data may also be directly retrieved from the NOAA
Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0 website: hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds.
If a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is
used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall
shall be 24 hours.
C. Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from
Table A-2 in Appendix A of this chapter.111
D. Suggested runoff coefficients (C) for both existing and proposed
conditions for use in the Rational Method are contained in Table A-4 in
Appendix A of this chapter.112
E. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate time-of-concentration for overland flow and
return periods from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 Version 3.0, rain data
corresponding to the Perkasie, Pennsylvania rain gage, as presented in
Table A-3 of Appendix A of this chapter. The Rational Method rainfall
curve data from NOAA is listed in Figure A-2 in Appendix A of this
chapter.113 Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated
using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to
time by NRCS). Times-of-concentration for channel and pipe flow shall
be computed using Manning's equation.

F. For the purposes of existing conditions flow rate determination for all
development activity, undeveloped land and existing impervious
surfaces shall be considered as "meadow" in good condition, unless the
natural ground cover generates a lower curve number (CN) or Rational
'C' value (e.g., forest), as listed in Tables A-2 and A-4 in Appendix A of
this chapter.114 Wooded areas shall use a ground cover of "woods in
good condition." An area shall be considered wooded if there is a
contiguous canopy of trees existing over an area of 1/4 acre or more.
G. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table A-5 in Appendix A of this
chapter.115
H. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
I. The design of any stormwater management facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing
the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the storage
indication method. For drainage areas greater than 20 acres in area,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph.
J. The time of concentration (Tc) is the time required for water to flow
from the hydraulically most remote point of the drainage area to the
point of interest (design point). Use of the rational formula requires
calculation of a Tc for each design point within the drainage basin.
Travel time estimation for the rational method shall be based on NRCS
Technical Release No. 55 (2nd Edition). For design purposes the time of
concentration may not be less than five minutes. Travel time (Tt) is the
time it takes runoff to travel from one location to another in a
watershed (subreach) and is a component of time of concentration. Tc is
computed by summing all the travel times for consecutive components
of the drainage conveyance system.
K. Water moves through a watershed as sheet flow, shallow concentrated
flow, open channel flow, or some combination of these. Sheet flow rates
shall be calculated using the NRCS TR-55 (1986) variation of the
kinematic wave equation. Sheet flow length may not exceed 50 feet
over paved surfaces and 150 feet over unpaved surfaces. Maximum
permitted sheet flow length shall be 150 feet unless site specific
conditions exist (that can be demonstrated) that warrant an increase of
the sheet flow length. Under no circumstances shall sheet flow length
exceed 300 feet. Shallow concentrated flow time and open channel flow
time shall be calculated using standard engineering methodologies.

§ 158-20. Erosion and sedimentation control requirements.
A. Whenever vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such activity
must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part 1, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Environmental Protection, Sub-Part C, protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, Erosion Control, and in
accordance with the Bucks County Conservation District and the
standards and specifications of the Borough. Various BMPs and their
design standards are identified in the PADEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual (March 2012), as amended and
updated.
B. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a PADEP NPDES
construction activities permit is required for regulated earth
disturbance activities of one acre or more.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate PADEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be submitted to the Borough.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by PADEP or Bucks County Conservation District
regulations, shall be available at the project site at all times.
F. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed,
include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity. Thirty-three-inch
super filter fabric fence (or other approved protection mechanism)
must be installed around proposed infiltration areas to prevent
encroachment and compaction by construction equipment.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization. If necessary, thirty-three-inch super
filter fabric fence (or other approved protection mechanism) must
be installed in the vicinity of infiltration area to prevent
contamination by runoff containing suspended sediment.
(3) Areas of the site to remain undisturbed shall be protected from
encroachment by construction equipment/vehicles to maintain the
existing infiltration characteristics of the soil. Four-foot-high
orange safety fence or other similar protection fence approved by
the Borough must be installed around the entire limit of
§ 158-20 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-20
152:399
disturbance/clearing prior to commencement of earthmoving
activities, and maintained until completion of all construction
activity.
G. Peak discharge rates from the site during land disturbance shall comply
with the appropriate sections in this chapter related to allowable postdevelopment
stormwater runoff rates, with the following additions:
(1) For purposes of calculating required detention storage during land
disturbance, peak discharges shall be calculated based upon the
runoff coefficients for bare soils during the period of maximum
anticipated disturbance from clearing and grading, in combination
with the entire quantity of proposed impervious surface
installation, indicated on the development plan. Runoff controls
shall insure that the peak rate of "during construction" runoff does
not exceed predevelopment runoff rates for the one-year frequency
through one-hundred-year frequency design storm events.
Detention storage during the period of land disturbance and prior
to establishment of permanent cover may require additional
detention facilities on a temporary basis. Such measures shall be
located so as to preserve the natural soil infiltration capacities of
the planned infiltration areas. Calculations based on the above
parameters must be submitted to verify compliance with this
requirement.
(2) Wherever soils, topography, cut and fill or grading requirements or
other conditions suggest substantial erosion potential during land
disturbance, the Borough may require that the entire volume of all
storms up to a two-year storm from the disturbed areas be retained
on site and that special sediment trapping facilities (such as check
dams, etc.) be installed.
H. Areas of the site to remain undisturbed shall be protected from
encroachment by construction equipment/vehicles to maintain the
existing infiltration characteristics of the soil.

Stormwater Management Application and Permit Requirements
§ 158-21. General requirements.
§ 158-22. Stormwater management site plan (SMSP) contents and
requirements.
For all regulated activities not exempt from provisions of this chapter, a
stormwater management site plan (SMSP) is required and shall consist of
all applicable calculations, maps, and plans. A note on the maps shall refer
to the associated computations and erosion and sedimentation control plan
by title and date. The cover sheet of the computations and erosion and
sedimentation control plan shall refer to the associated maps by title and
date. All SMSP application documents shall be submitted to the Borough in
a format that is clear, concise, legible, neat, and well organized; otherwise,
A. For any of the development activities regulated by this chapter as
defined pursuant to § 158-4E, the final approval of subdivision and/or
land development plans, the issuance of any building, zoning, or
occupancy permit, or the commencement of any land disturbance
activity may not proceed until the property owner or developer or his/
her agent has received a stormwater management permit (permit) or
approval of a stormwater management exemption by the Borough. Final
approval of a subdivision and/or land development plan and recordation
of same with the Bucks County Recorder of Deeds, shall constitute
approval of the stormwater management permit for stormwater
facilities/BMPs proposed on the plan.
B. A stormwater management site plan (SMSP) shall be required in
conjunction with a stormwater management permit for all regulated
development activities that do not qualify for exemption from the
provisions of this chapter pursuant to § 158-5B and § 158-5C. The SMSP
shall include all items identified pursuant to § 158-22. The SMSP
approved by the Borough shall be on-site throughout the duration of the
regulated activity.
C. A simplified stormwater management site plan (SSMSP) shall be
required in conjunction with a permit for regulated development
activities qualifying for exemption of the provisions of this chapter
pursuant to § 158-5C. The SSMSP shall include all items identified
pursuant to § 158-23. The SSMSP approved by the Borough shall be onsite
throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
D. A stormwater management permit shall only be issued upon approval of
a stormwater management site plan or simplified stormwater
management site plan by the Borough. A stormwater management
permit is not required for regulated activities exempt pursuant to
§ 158-5B of this chapter, but approval of a stormwater management
exemption must be issued by the Borough pursuant to § 158-5B and
§ 158-5F, prior to commencement of regulated activities.
§ 158-21 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-22
152:401
the stormwater management site plan shall be disapproved and returned
to the applicant. The following items shall be included in the stormwater
management site plan:
A. Two copies of the completed Borough stormwater management
application form.
B. Grading/drainage review fee and escrow, as established by separate
resolution of Borough Council.
C. A feasibility analysis that evaluates the potential application of
infiltration, flow attenuation, bioretention, wetland, or wet pond BMPs
must be submitted with the stormwater management site plans
required in Article IV.
(1) The feasibility analysis must allow the Borough to review the
general soil characteristics of a site and the proposed development
for that site and determine if infiltration BMPs or wet pond or
artificial wetland BMPs could have been more thoroughly pursued
for use by the developer. The information required in the analysis
shall be detailed enough to determine the potential applicability of
these BMPs for a proposed development, but general enough not to
force a developer into incurring excessive cost associated with
conducting laborious field and/or laboratory soil testing for a site
which ultimately may not be suitable for infiltration or wet pond or
artificial wetland BMP implementation. However, with the
requirements for conducting a feasibility analysis, developers must
be aware that they are expected to use these BMPs wherever
possible and are required to provide adequate justification if these
BMPs are not to be implemented. Essentially, all developers will be
conducting feasibility analysis since such analysis would become
the preliminary step in evaluating the potential for implementation
of these mandatory BMPs where possible. Developers for those
sites that are determined to be generally suitable from these
analysis (taking into consideration the areal extent of suitable soils
necessary to accommodate an infiltration or wet pond or wetland
BMP for the type and size of development proposed) are required
to conduct the detailed soil testing and other feasibility testing
required in other sections of this chapter which contain the
description and additional design criteria of these BMPs. This
analysis shall provide:
(a) A general assessment of the anticipated additional runoff
based on the design storm and post-development condition and
utilizing the calculation procedures required in § 158-19;
(b) Indication of drainage areas on the development site resulting
in impervious, pervious, and rooftop runoff;
(c) Indication of type of land use (residential, nonresidential)
generating the impervious surface runoff;

B. Other items may be included in the agreement where determined
necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all facilities.
The O&M agreement shall be subject to review and approval of the
Borough.
C. The owner is responsible for the O&M of the SWM BMPs. If the owner
fails to adhere to the O&M agreement, the Borough may perform the
services required and charge the owner appropriate fees. Nonpayment
of fees may result in a lien against the property as described in
§ 158-38.
A. Stormwater management easements shall be granted by the property
owner as necessary to provide for:
(1) Access to the property by the Borough for facility inspections and
emergency maintenance.
(2) Preservation of stormwater runoff conveyance, infiltration, and
detention areas and facilities, including flood routes for the onehundred-
year storm event.
B. Stormwater management/BMP facilities easements are required for all
areas used for off-site stormwater control, unless a waiver is granted by

provision permitting access to such easement(s), at any reasonable
time, for inspection and/or emergency repair/maintenance, by Perkasie
Borough or its designee, of all facilities deemed critical to public
welfare.
A. If stormwater management/BMP facilities are accepted by the Borough
for dedication, persons installing stormwater management/BMP
facilities shall be required to pay a specified amount to the Borough
stormwater maintenance fund to help defray costs of periodic
inspections and maintenance expenses. The amount of the deposit shall
be determined as follows:
§ 158-40 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 158-42
152:421
§ 158-43. Post-construction maintenance inspections.
(1) If the facilities are to be owned and maintained by the Borough, the
deposit shall cover the estimated costs for maintenance and
inspections for 10 years. The Borough Engineer will establish the
estimated costs utilizing information submitted by the applicant.
(2) The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The Borough Engineer shall
determine the present worth equivalents, which shall be subject to
the approval of Borough Council.
B. If a stormwater management/BMP facility is proposed that also serves
as a recreation facility (e.g., ball field, pond), the Borough may, but is
not required to, reduce or waive the amount of the maintenance fund
deposit based upon the value of the land for public recreation purpose.
C. If at some future time a storage facility (whether publicly or privately
owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or other
storage facility, the unused portion of the maintenance fund deposit will
be applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to the
storm sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the deposit
remaining after the costs of abandonment are paid will be returned to
the depositor.
D. A financial deposit to the Borough stormwater maintenance fund shall
be required to be paid by the developer to help defray costs of periodic
inspections and maintenance expenses associated with all stormwater
management facilities, storm sewer, culverts, or other such
improvements required by PennDOT, to be constructed within the rightof-
way of public roadways or easement areas, that are to be maintained
after dedication by the Borough. The deposit shall cover the estimated
cost for maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The Borough
Engineer will establish the estimated cost upon review of information
submitted by the applicant. The amount of the deposit to the fund shall
be converted to present worth of the annual series values. The Borough
Engineer shall determine the present worth equivalents, which shall be
subject to the approval of Borough Council.
A. Stormwater management BMPs should be inspected for proper
operation by the landowner, or the owner's designee (including

waters of the commonwealth or U.S. by the Borough, then the Borough
will notify the responsible person to cease the discharge.
E. Upon notice provided by the Borough under § 158-44D, the discharger
will have a reasonable time to cease the discharge consistent with the
degree of pollution caused by the discharge.
F. Nothing in this section shall affect a discharger's responsibility under
state law.
A. Prohibited connections. The following connections are prohibited,
except as provided in § 158-44C above:
(1) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface,
which allows any nonstormwater discharge, including sewage,

made in the past, regardless of whether the connection, drain or
conveyance was previously allowed, permitted, or approved by a
government agency, or otherwise permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
A. Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers,
or roadside ditches and shall discharge to infiltration areas or
vegetative BMPs to the maximum extent practicable to satisfy the
criteria for disconnection of impervious surfaces. Roof drains may be
connected to streets, storm sewers or roadside ditches when it is more

system shall be the responsibility of the property owner, and all work
shall be performed as directed by the Borough. If a storm sewer is
not available for connection, then the property owner must pursue
other options for discharge, including the construction of a seepage pit
or on-site stormwater management facilities. Any deviation from this
requirement will only be permitted on a case-by-case basis after review
and approval by the Borough and/or the Borough Engineer.
A. No person shall modify, remove, fill, landscape, or alter any existing
stormwater management BMP, unless part of an approved maintenance

presence of hydrophytic or wetland vegetation. The second parameter
considers whether the soil develops under saturated conditions and will
exhibit certain morphological characteristics that distinguish it as a
hydric soil. Finally, the third parameter considers the hydrology, so that
an area must have either permanent surface water or be periodically
inundated during the growing season by ground- or surface
water.[Added 9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604]

connection therewith or for the common use of occupants of buildings
within the subdivision or land development unless and until final plans
of such subdivision or development have been prepared by a registered
professional engineer or registered land surveyor, submitted to and
approved in writing thereon by the Borough Council (except for minor
subdivisions) and recorded in the Bucks County Recorder of Deeds' office

connection therewith have either been constructed or guaranteed as
hereinafter provided.
B. No building in a subdivision or land development depending on ingress
and egress upon the improvement of any street or streets herein
provided for shall be permitted to be occupied before improvements are
fully completed from a now-existing paved street to and across the front
of the lot on which the building is located and/or to a sufficient depth
along the side of the lot to service any driveway, driveways or parking
spaces.
C. No building depending upon public water and sewer facilities shall be
permitted to be occupied before such facilities are fully provided and

institute and maintain appropriate actions in law or in equity to
restrain, correct or abate violations, to prevent unlawful construction,
recover damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building,
structure or premises. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling
or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such
penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
B. The Borough, its Zoning Officer or other officers, may refuse to issue
any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve or
develop any real property which has been developed or which has
resulted from a subdivision of real property in violation of any provision
of this chapter. This authority to deny any such permits or approvals
shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
C. No permit shall be issued nor shall any approval be granted to any
applicant identified in Subsection B above, unless such applicant
complies with the conditions which would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real

A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated any
of the provisions of this chapter, upon being found liable therefor in a
civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, shall pay a
judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs plus reasonable
attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment
shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice. If the defendant
neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the district justice determining that there has been a violation,
§ 164-7 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-7.1
152:467
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to
have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date
of the determination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter
each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition of the defendant, may grant

A. A tentative sketch plan is an optional submission. It is offered to give
the applicant an opportunity to consult early and informally in the plan
preparation phase with the municipality and the County Planning
Commission. The purpose of this submission is to allow the municipality
and the applicant the opportunity to discuss such things as the lot
layout, location of buildings, street layout, the arrangement and
location of open space and other matters dealing with the land
development and subdivision before detailed engineering is done. The
municipality will comment on not only whether the sketch plan meets
the objectives of the Borough ordinances but also if it feels it is
consistent with sound planning and design principles. It is not intended
in any way to replace the preliminary plan, but rather to give the
applicant guidance in preparing the much more detailed preliminary
plan. Recommendations and comments made by the Borough in
response to a tentative sketch plan submission shall in no way be
regarded as official approval, nor shall any such action grant any legal
rights to the applicant or immunity from full compliance with the
requirements and procedures set forth for preliminary and final plans.
B. Procedure. [Amended 9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604; 5-21-1990 by

B checklist133 for completeness and, if the submission is

resubdivision or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, suitable
access to street openings for such an eventuality shall be provided.
H. Stub streets shall only be permitted within a subdivision having phased
development in which the proposed street has been approved in its
entirety and where the proposed street is plotted in two or more
phases. No stub street shall be required when the subdivided parcel

A. General regulations.
(1) Buffer yards are required between subdivisions and land
developments and along existing and proposed streets, except in
the case of a lot line adjustment. The extent of buffering required
shall be determined by the type of use proposed and the adjacent
uses or streets surrounding the proposed development. The impact
of the proposed use on adjoining properties is the basis for
establishing buffer yard standards. [Amended 9-19-1988 by Ord.
No. 604; 11-21-2005 by Ord. No. 897]
(2) Trees in buffers along streets shall not be planted opposite each
other but shall alternate.
(3) At intersections, trees shall be located no closer than 30 feet from
the intersection of the street right-of-way lines.
(4) Where the planting strip between the curb and sidewalk is less
than seven feet wide, the street trees shall be planted on the lots.

B. Determination of required buffer. To determine the required buffer yard
and planting schedule, a three-step procedure shall be followed:
(1) Step 1: site analysis and determination of buffer yard class.
(2) Step 2: selection of the planting option for the buffer class.
(3) Step 3: selection of the plant materials from the plant materials list.
C. Step 1: site analysis and determination of buffer yard class.
(1) For each property boundary, the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land use or road classification. Land use information shall
be determined by an on-site survey, and the Perkasie Borough
Zoning Ordinance shall be utilized to determine road
classifications. Table 1 below154 specifies the buffer yard class for
each boundary.
(2) The applicant shall match his proposed land use with the
corresponding adjacent land use or road classification for each
property boundary. The letter indicates the buffer yard class.
D. Step 2: selection of the planting option for the buffer class.
(1) After determining the buffer class, the applicant shall select a
planting option from Table 2 to meet the buffer yard requirement
for each boundary. The Borough may consider an alternative
planting option which shall have a screening capability equal to or
greater than any of the available options.
(2) Table 2: planting options. The options below indicate the amount of
plant material that is required per linear foot of property line.
Plantings aligned on property or right-of-way boundaries shall be
located one to five feet inside of the boundary line. Plantings are
not required to be aligned on property or right-of-way boundaries
and may be sited on any portion of the property for buffering
purposes. The Borough may permit staggering or grouping of plant
materials if a satisfactory buffer is achieved. [Amended
9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604]
Class Option
A 1 canopy tree per 40 feet of boundary
B Within a 15-foot buffer yard: 1 canopy tree per 40 feet and 1
flowering tree per 60 feet of boundary
C Within a 30-foot buffer yard: 1 evergreen per 20 feet and 1

§ 164-39 PERKASIE CODE § 164-39
152:510
§ 164-40. Determining site capacity.
Each site is unique. It has physical features which are rarely precisely
duplicated on another site. Portions of some sites may not be usable and
a minimum amount of buildable land should be retained for recreation.
The purpose of this section is to determine the appropriate intensity of use
to which a specific tract may be put. For each tract that is five acres or
larger in R-1A and R-1B Residential Districts, the developer shall include
the following calculation with the initial plan submission:
(4) Dedication of development rights. The Borough or county may
accept, but shall not be required to accept, title to the development
rights to any portion or portions of the open space. In such cases,
the land remains in the ownership of the individual while the
development rights are held in public ownership. The county shall
accept ownership only in accordance with the provisions of Act 442
and county plans; the Borough may accept such lands as it sees fit.
In either case, there shall be no cost for acquisition or maintenance
to county or Borough.
A. Base site area. Certain portions of a tract may not be usable for the
activities proposed for the site; these shall therefore be subtracted from
the site area to determine base site area:
(1) Site area as determined by actual on-site survey (acres).
(2) Subtract: land within ultimate rights-of-way of existing roads or
utility rights-of-way or easements (acres).
(3) Subtract: land which is not contiguous, i.e., a separate parcel which
does not abut or adjoin nor share common boundaries with the rest
of the development and/or land which is cut off from the main
parcel by a road, railroad, existing land uses or major stream so as
to serve as a major barrier to common use or so that it is isolated
and unavailable for building purposes (acres).
(4) Subtract: land which in a previously approved subdivision was
reserved for resource reasons, such as flooding or recreation
(acres).
(5) Subtract: land used or zoned for another use, i.e., land which is
used or to be used for commercial or industrial uses in a residential
development or land in a different zoning district than the primary
use (acres).
(6) Equals base site area (acres).
B. Resource protection land.
(1) All land within the base site area shall be mapped and measured for
the purpose of determining the amount of open space needed to
protect it.
§ 164-39 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-40
152:511
§ 164-41. Environmental protection.
The developer shall determine the presence of environmental or natural
features on the site and shall meet the following standards of environmental
protection. Site alterations, regrading, filling or clearing of vegetation prior
to submission of the plans for development shall be a violation of this
chapter.
(2) The resource protection land equals, for each resource, the acres of
land in the resource multiplied by the open space ratio for that
resource. The open space ratios are as follows:
Resource Open Space Ratio
Floodplain district 1.00
Floodplain soils 1.00
Lakes or ponds 1.00
Natural retention area .90
Steep slope (25% or more) .85
Steep slope (15% to 25%) .70
Steep slope (8% to 15%) .60
(3) The total land with resource restrictions equals the total of the
acres of land in each resource.
(4) The total resource protection land equals the total of all of the
lands resulting from the calculation in § 164-40B(2) above.
C. Determination of site capacity. Individual site capacity is found by
calculating net buildable site area. For single-family or performance
standard subdivisions, the number of allowable dwelling units is
determined by multiplying the density by net buildable site area. The
calculations are as follows:
(1) The base site area (acres) multiplied by the open space ratio
(Chapter 186, Zoning, § 186-44) (acres) equals the minimum
required open space (acres).
(2) The base site area (acres) minus the total resource protection land
or minimum required open space, whichever is greater (acres),
equals the net buildable site area (acres).
(3) The net buildable site area (acres) multiplied by the density
(Chapter 186, Zoning, § 186-44) (acres) equals the number of
dwelling units (do not round up).
A. Floodplains.157 All such lands shall remain as permanent open space,
except that roads and utilities may cross the floodplain where design
approval is obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
157. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 94, Floodplain Management.
§ 164-40 PERKASIE CODE § 164-41
152:512
Environmental Protection and where other applicable ordinances,
regulations and statutes are complied with.
B. Floodplain soils. All such lands shall remain as permanent open space,
except that roads may cross these soils where design approval is
obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and that recreational, conservation or agricultural open
space uses shall be permitted. Where floodplains are defined, they shall
be used rather than floodplain soils.
C. Steep slopes. In areas of steep slopes, i.e., those above 8%, the
following standards shall apply:
(1) Eight percent to 15%: No more than 40% of such areas shall be
developed and/or regraded or stripped of vegetation.
(2) Fifteen percent to 25%: No more than 30% of such areas shall be
developed and/or regraded or stripped of vegetation.
(3) Twenty-five percent or more: No more than 15% of such areas shall
be developed and/or regraded or stripped of vegetation.
(4) Notwithstanding any standards established herein, any slopes
having a grade of 15% or greater and being part of a woodland area
shall be preserved so that 80% of such slope shall remain in natural
cover and as permanent open space. [Added 9-19-1988 by Ord.
No. 604]
D. Lakes and ponds. These areas shall be left as permanent open space.
No development, filling, piping or diverting shall be permitted.
[Amended 9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604]
E. Natural retention areas. Such areas shall be 100% open space.
[Amended 9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604]
F. Wetlands. Such areas shall be left as permanent open space. No
development, filling, piping or diverting shall be permitted. In addition,
a buffer of 100 feet shall be maintained from the limits of the wetland
vegetation or the limit of the wetland soils, whichever is less, in order to
minimize hydrologic modifications and potential for pollution. Within
the buffer area, an 80% natural cover must be maintained as permanent
open space. The remaining 20% of the buffer area may be developed.
[Added 9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604; amended 2-20-1989 by Ord.
No. 615]
G. Woodlands. Such areas shall remain in at least 50% open space,
provided further that such open space area shall permanently retain the
original natural cover. [Added 9-19-1988 by Ord. No. 604]
H. Topsoil standards. [Added 10-16-1995 by Ord. No. 770]
(1) After final grading, there shall be a minimum of six inches of topsoil
on the entire site other than that portion of the site where there are
§ 164-41 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-41
152:513
§ 164-41.1. Tree protection standards. 158 [Added 8-7-1989 by Ord.
No. 621]
buildings or other impervious surface coverage. There shall be no
removal of excess topsoil permitted from the site until inspection
and approval of compliance with this section by the Borough
Engineer.
(2) The developer is not required to import topsoil to the site if a sixinch
final depth cannot be achieved. In cases where the original
site has less than six inches of topsoil at the start of the grading
activities, as determined by the Borough Engineer, the total amount
available on the site at that time will become the minimum topsoil
requirement. No topsoil will be allowed to be removed from the site
in that instance.
A. General requirements.
(1) Grade changes and excavations shall not encroach upon the tree
protection zone (TPZ).
(2) No toxic materials shall be stored within 100 feet of a tree
protection zone, including petroleum based and/or derived
products.
(3) The area within the TPZ shall not be built upon, nor shall any
materials be stored there, either temporarily or permanently.
Vehicles and equipment shall not be parked in the TPZ.
(4) When tree stumps are located within 10 feet of the tree protection
zone, the stumps shall be removed by means of a stump grinder to
minimize the effect on surrounding root systems.
(5) Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or
similar equipment aligned radially to the tree. This method reduces
the lateral movement of the roots during excavation which, if done
by other methods, could damage the intertwined roots of adjacent
trees.
(6) Within four hours of any severance of roots, all tree roots that have
been exposed and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and
covered temporarily with moist peat moss, moist burlap or other
moist biodegradable material to keep them from drying out until
permanent cover can be installed.
(7) Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not discharge into
the tree protection zone.
(8) Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not be located
within the tree protection zone.
158. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 175, Trees.
§ 164-41 PERKASIE CODE § 164-41.1
152:514
B. The tree protection zone. Prior to construction, the tree protection zone
shall be delineated by the following methods:
(1) The tree protection zone that is delineated on the site prior to
construction shall conform to the approved development plans.
(2) All trees scheduled to remain shall be marked; where groups of
trees exist, only the trees on the edge need to be marked.
(3) A forty-eight-inch-high wooden snowfence mounted on steel posts,
located eight feet on center, shall be placed along the boundary of
the tree protection zone.
(4) In addition to the tree protection zone, trees may be left standing
as protection between the trunks of the trees to be retained and the
limits of grading. When additional trees are used as protection, the
tree protection zone on the approved plan shall be marked in the
field so that the additional buffer area is delineated. When this
method of protection is used, these additional trees shall be
removed at the time of completion of the project.
(5) When the wooden snowfence has been installed, it shall be
inspected and approved by the Borough Arborist prior to
commencing clearing and further construction; the fencing along
the tree protection zone shall be maintained until all work/
construction has been completed; and damages to the protective
fencing shall be replaced and repaired before further construction
shall begin.
(6) Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a
tree protection zone or into trees that are to be retained.
C. Retaining walls.
(1) When the original grade cannot be retained at the tree protection
zone line, a retaining wall shall be constructed outside of the tree
protection zone.
(2) The retaining wall shall be designed to comply with the municipal
standards for retaining walls.
(3) In addition, the following methods shall be used to ensure survival
of the tree:
(a) The top of the wall shall be four inches above the finished
grade line.
(b) The wall shall be constructed of large stones, brick, building
tile, concrete blocks or treated woodbeams not less than six by
six inches; a means for drainage through the wall shall be
provided so water will not accumulate on either side of the
wall. Weep holes shall be required with any wall.
§ 164-41.1 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-41.1
152:515
(c) Any severed roots as a result of excavation shall be trimmed so
that their edges are smooth and are cut back to a lateral root if
exposed.
(d) A layer of clean stone (sized 3/4 inch to one inch) shall be
placed one foot out from the wall to aid in drainage.
D. Pruning methods. All final cuts shall be made sufficiently close to the
trunk or parent limb but without cutting into the branch collar or
leaving a protruding stub, according to the National Arborist
Association standards. All necessary pruning cuts must be made to
prevent bark from being torn from the tree and to facilitate rapid
healing. Flush cuts are unacceptable.
E. Fertilization methods.
(1) All trees which have experienced any disturbance or have had
damages to the roots or branches shall be fertilized.
(2) Trees shall be fertilized in early fall (September to October) or
midspring (April to May). Fall applications are preferred.
(3) Fertilizer shall be broadcast over the soil surface in an area twice
the size of the tree protection zone at the rates given in Subsection
E(5) below. A minimum of 1,000 square feet per tree will receive
fertilization.
(4) Fertilizer grade shall have approximately three parts nitrogen to
one part phosphorus and potassium (3:1:1 ratio).
(5) Fertilizer shall be applied at a rate equivalent to one pound
nitrogen per 1,000 square feet.
Example: How much 20:8:8 fertilizer needed to apply one
pound nitrogen over 1,000 square feet.
Need 1 pound nitrogen

x = 5 pounds
5 pounds 20:8:8 should be broadcast over an area of
1,000 square feet.
F. Trenching and tunneling.
(1) If there is no alternative but to locate a utility line through a TPZ,
tunneling shall be used instead of trenching, except where, in the
opinion of the Borough Arborist, survival of the tree would not be
affected by either method. The Borough Arborist shall determine
the most desirable location for the utility line.
(2) Trenches shall be filled as soon as possible and tamped lightly to
avoid air spaces.
A. Requirement for Transportation Impact Study. A Transportation Impact
Study shall be required for all major subdivisions and land
developments to enable the Borough to assess the impact of a proposed
development on the local transportation systems, both highways and
public transportation. The purpose of the study is to ensure that
proposed developments do not adversely affect the transportation
network and to identify any traffic problems that are created in the
existing highway network as a result of the development and to
delineate solutions to potential problems and to present improvements
to be incorporated into the proposed development or to the highway
and/or public transportation systems within the designated study area.
The study shall assist in the protection of air quality, the conservation of
energy and the encouragement of public transportation use.
B. Conduct of the Transportation Impact Study. The Transportation Impact
Study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic engineer and/or
transportation planner with previous traffic study experience in
accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section.
C. Applicability. A Transportation Impact Study shall be submitted as part
of the preliminary plan application for all subdivision and land
development proposals that have the potential of generating 250 or
more trips per day. The number of trips per day are determined through
the use of the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE), Trip Generation publication. The proposed
development shall be identified using the ITE land use code that best
describes the use of the proposed development. Where doubt exists, the
applicant shall seek guidance from the Borough Engineer or his/her
designee. The application shall not be considered complete until the
Transportation Impact Study is submitted to the Borough in accordance
§ 164-41.1 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-41.2
152:517
with the provisions of this section. Council may, at its discretion,
require any other application to be accompanied by a Transportation
Impact Study, provided that Council notifies the applicant immediately
following Council's first meeting to consider the proposal. Such
notification shall specify the reason for the requirement, citing the
proposal's particular location or existing problems or type of use (e.g.,
generation of heavy truck traffic).
D. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
CAPACITY ANALYSIS  The analysis compares the actual or projected
traffic volume to the intersection capacity and results in a volume/
capacity (v/c) ratio. Intersection approach capacity is the maximum rate
of vehicular flow that can pass through an intersection under prevailing
roadway, traffic and signalization conditions.
LANE GROUPS  Each individual vehicular movement that may be
completed from an existing lane, such as a left turn, right turn, or
through movement.
LEVEL OF SERVICE  Level of service (LOS) as described in the
Highway Capacity Manual 2000, Transportation Research Board, is
a qualitative measure of the operational conditions within a traffic
stream and their perceptions by motorists. Levels of service are defined
in terms of delay for signalized intersections and reserve capacity
for unsignalized intersections. Six levels of service (A through F) are
defined for a transportation facility. LOS A represents ideal operation
conditions with no congestion, and LOS F represents a breakdown in
operating conditions with severe congestion.
MAJOR INTERSECTION  Any intersection, either signalized or
unsignalized, where traffic generated by the proposal may have an
impact on the operation of the intersection. The transportation
engineer shall seek guidance from the Borough Engineer prior to the
initiation of the Transportation Impact Study to ensure agreement on
the location of major intersections.
OFF-SITE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS  Other
transportation improvements that are generally not contiguous with the
property being developed and not required as an on-site improvement,
but found to be necessary as a result of the proposed development.
ON-SITE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS  All improvements on
or adjacent to the development site in the public right-of-way required
to be constricted by the developer pursuant to any ordinance,
resolution or requirement of the Borough and/or directly related to the
transportation needs of the subdivision and/or land development.
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION  Transportation services for the general
public provided by a common carrier of passengers generally, but not
necessarily on a regular route basis, by the Southeastern Pennsylvania
§ 164-41.2 PERKASIE CODE § 164-41.2
152:518
Transportation Authority or a private operator operating service to the
public.
STUDY AREA  This area will extend along the adjacent roadways in all
directions approximately 1/2 mile from the site access points. The study
area will include all major intersections in the vicinity of the proposed
development. The transportation engineer will seek guidance from the
Borough Engineer prior to initiation of the Transportation Impact Study
to ensure agreement on the study area boundaries.
TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANTS  A series of tests that detail the
minimum traffic or pedestrian volumes or other criteria necessary for
the installation of a traffic signal. These warrants are outlined in the
then-current edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
for Streets and Highways, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal
Highway Administration.
TRIP GENERATION RATES  The total count of vehicular trips to and
from the study site per unit of land use, as measured by parameters
such as square footage or dwelling units. The latest edition of Trip
Generation by the ITE shall be referenced to determine trip generation
rates.
E. General requirements and standards.
(1) General site description. The site description shall include the size,
location, proposed land use(s), construction staging, and
completion date of the proposed development. If the development
is residential, a description of the types and number of dwelling
units shall also be included. The general site description shall also
include probable socioeconomic characteristics of potential site
users to the extent that they may affect the transportation needs of
the site (e.g., number of senior citizens). A brief description of
other major existing and proposed land developments within the
study area shall also be provided.
(2) Transportation facilities description.
(a) The description shall contain a full documentation of the
proposed internal and existing external transportation system.
This description shall include proposed internal vehicular,
bicycle and pedestrian circulation, all proposed ingress and
egress locations, all internal roadway widths and rights-of-way,
parking conditions, traffic channelizations, and any traffic
signals or other intersection control devices at all intersections
within the site. The site design shall be shown to maximize
potential public transportation usage to and from the
development, such as providing adequate turning radii at all
access points to allow a bus to enter the development and
designating bus shelters and sign locations where appropriate.
(b) The report shall describe the entire external roadway system
within the study area. Major intersections in the study area
§ 164-41.2 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-41.2
152:519
shall be identified and illustrated. All existing and proposed
public transportation services and facilities within a one-mile
radius of the site shall also be documented. All regional rail
stations within a three-mile radius of the site shall also be
documented. All future highway improvements, including
proposed constriction and intersection signalization, shall be
noted. This information shall be obtained from the latest
Regional Transportation Improvement Program maintained by
the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. Any
roadway improvements to be conducted in conjunction with
surrounding land developments shall be recorded.
(3) Existing traffic conditions.
(a) Existing traffic conditions shall be measured and documented
for all roadways and intersections in the study area, and shall
include current average daily traffic volumes, peak highway
hour(s) traffic volumes, and peak development-generated
hours(s) traffic volumes. Traffic counts date shall not be more
than one year old. Traffic counts shall be taken on a Tuesday,
Wednesday or Thursday of a nonholiday week. Additional
counts (Saturday for a commercial or tourist attraction) may
also be required in some cases. The individual or firm
performing the Transportation Impact Study shall obtain the
traffic counts during average volume conditions during fair
weather, and in consideration of any construction activities or
special events which may otherwise affect traffic volumes of
the roadway.
(b) Roadway characteristics shall be described and illustrated.
Features to be addressed shall include lane configurations,
geometry, signal timing, traffic control devices, posted speed
limits, and sight distance limitations. Existing levels of service
shall be calculated for all intersections and turning movements
within the study area.
(c) This analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing
roadway system to serve the existing traffic demand.
Roadways, signalized intersections, or individual movements
experiencing levels of service below C, and v/c rations greater
than or equal to 1.0 shall be noted as deficient. Unsignalized
intersections with levels of service below D shall also be
indicated.
(4) Transportation impact of development.
(a) Estimation of vehicular trips to result from the proposal shall
be completed for the average daily trips, average daily peak
highway hour(s) and peak development-generated hour(s).
Vehicular trip generation rates to be used for this calculation
shall be obtained from the latest edition of Trip Generation. For
§ 164-41.2 PERKASIE CODE § 164-41.2
152:520
land uses not listed in the document, the transportation
engineer shall seek guidance from the Borough Zoning Officer
and Borough Engineer.
(b) All turning movements shall be calculated. These generated
volumes shall be distributed to the study area and assigned to
the existing roadways and intersections throughout the study
area. Documentation of all assumptions used in the
distribution and assignment phases shall be provided. Traffic
volumes shall be assigned to individual access points.
Pedestrian volumes shall also be calculated, if applicable. If
school crossings are to be used, pedestrian volumes shall be
assigned for each crossing. Any characteristics of the site that
will cause particular trip generation or distribution problems
shall be noted.
(5) Analysis of transportation impact.
(a) The total future traffic shall be calculated, and shall consist of
the existing traffic volume expanded to the project completion
year using an annual background growth factor plus the
development-generated traffic and the traffic generated by
other developments in the study area. The annual background
growth factor shall be determined using the projected rates of
population and employment growth as determined by the
Bucks County Planning Commission, the average annual traffic
growth of the area's roadways as determined from the
Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's "Highway
Network Coverage Traffic Counts" or the Bucks County
Planning Commission's traffic count database, and current
twenty-four-hour traffic counts.
(b) The delay analysis shall be conducted using the total future
demand and the future roadway capacity. If staging of the
proposed development is anticipated, calculations for each
stage of development shall be made.
(c) The analysis shall be performed for the peak highway hour(s)
and peak development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and
intersections in the study area. Delay calculations shall be
made for all intersections in the study area as well as for all
access points into the development. It is usually at these
locations that capacity is most restricted. A volume/capacity
analysis shall be conducted for all intersections having a future
level of service below C.
(d) All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined
as to the feasibility of installing traffic signals. This evaluation
shall compare the projected traffic and pedestrian volumes to
the warrants for traffic signal installation.
(6) Conclusions and recommended improvements.
§ 164-41.2 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 164-41.2
152:521
(a) Levels of service and volume/capacity ratios shall be listed for
all roadways and intersection lane groups. All roadways,
signalized intersections, and/or lane groups showing levels of
service below C and volume/capacity ratios greater than or
equal to 1.0 shall be considered deficient. Specific
recommendations for the elimination of all deficiencies shall be
listed, and shall include but not be limited to the following
elements: internal circulation design, site access location and
design, external roadway intersection design and
improvements, traffic signal installation and operation
including signal timing, and transit design improvements. All
physical roadway improvements shall be illustrated. Signal
timing should be evaluated for any intersection with a level of
service below C but a volume/capacity ratio less than 1.0.
Warrants for signalization shall be examined for all
unsignalized intersections operating at deficient levels of
service.
(b) The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate
any changes to the level of service achieved by these
measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of
improvements shall be described. The mitigation measures
may include recommendations such as roadway widening,
turning lanes, deceleration lanes/tapers, changes to
signalization, use of access management techniques or a
reduction in the proposed intensity of use. The responsibility
and timing of all recommended roadway improvements shall
be described within the Transportation Impact Study.
(c) Existing and/or future public transportation service shall also
be addressed. Listings of all actions to be taken to encourage
public transportation usage for development-generated trips
and/or improve existing service, if applicable, shall be
included.
F. Submission procedures and implementation.
(1) Time of Submission.
(a) The Transportation Impact Study shall be submitted to the
Borough of Perkasie and the Bucks County Planning
Commission with the preliminary plan application. If a sketch
plan is submitted for the proposed development, it would be
advantageous to the applicant to submit a Transportation
Impact Study at this time. However, the Transportation Impact
Study shall be resubmitted at the preliminary plan stage.
Furthermore, if a preliminary plan is revised, the
Transportation Impact Study may also need to be revised,
depending upon the revisions to the plan.
§ 164-41.2 PERKASIE CODE § 164-41.2
152:522
(b) Improvement plans shall not be submitted to Penn DOT until
the plans have been reviewed by the Perkasie Borough
Planning Commission, the Perkasie Borough Engineer, the
Bucks County Planning Commission and the Perkasie Borough
Council. The submittal to Penn DOT shall be accompanied by
the comments of the Borough, Borough Engineer and the
Bucks County Planning Commission.
(2) Implementation. The Perkasie Borough Planning Commission, the
Bucks County Planning Commission, the Perkasie Borough
Engineer and the Perkasie Borough Council shall review the
Transportation Impact Study to analyze its adequacy in identifying
solutions to traffic problems that may occur either totally, or in part
as a result of the subdivision or land development. Transportation
improvements required in order to eliminate deficient conditions
on or adjacent to the site, that result from the development, may be
mandatory for plan approval. These necessary improvements may
be attached to the conditions of approval set forth by the Borough
prior to plan approval. If the Borough determines that additional
off-site improvements are necessary prior to plan approval, the
developer shall have the opportunity to resubmit alternative
improvement designs.

or individuals employing persons owing delinquent earned income taxes or
whose wife owes delinquent earned income taxes or having in possession
unpaid commissions or earnings belonging to any person or persons owing
delinquent earned income taxes or whose wife owes delinquent earned
income taxes upon the presentation of a written notice and demand under
oath or affirmation, containing the name of the taxable or the husband
thereof and the amount of tax due. Upon the presentation of such written
notice and demand, it shall be the duty of any such corporation, political
subdivision, association, company, firm or individual to deduct from the

political subdivision, association, company, firm or individual to deduct the
amount of such taxes or to pay the same over to the Tax Collector, less the
cost of bookkeeping involved in such transaction, as herein provided, within
the time required, such corporation, political subdivision, association,
company, firm or individual shall forfeit and pay the amount of such tax for
each such taxable whose taxes are not withheld and paid over or that are
withheld and not paid over, together with a penalty of 10% added thereto,
to be recovered by an action of assumpsit in a suit to be instituted by the
Tax Collector or by the proper authorities of the taxing district as debts of
like amount are now by law recoverable, except that such person shall not
have the benefit of any stay of execution or exemption law.

ARTICLE III
Real Estate Transfer Tax
[Adopted 1-19-1987 by Ord. No. 585]
§ 170-21. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Realty Transfer Tax Ordinance of the
Borough."
§ 170-22. Imposition of tax; statutory authority.
A realty transfer tax for general revenue purposes is hereby imposed upon
the transfer of real estate or interest in real estate situated within the
Borough, regardless of where the documents making the transfer are made,
executed or delivered, or where the actual settlements on such transfer took
place as authorized by Article XI-D, Local Real Estate Transfer Tax, 72 P.S.
§ 8101-D et seq.
§ 170-23. Definitions.171
As used in this article, the words and phrases defined in 72 P.S. § 8101-C,
as amended from time to time, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
said section.
§ 170-24. Rate and payment of tax; interest.
A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document, or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording, shall be
subject to pay for and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof, a
tax at the rate of 1% of the value of the real estate represented by such
document, which tax shall be payable at the earlier of the time the
document is presented for recording or within 30 days of acceptance of
such document or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.
B. The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder whereon the date
of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough under the authority of that
Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax exists, except as
hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and such one-half
rate shall become effective without any action on the part of the
171. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 170-21 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 170-24
152:563
§ 170-25. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment or the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 170-26. Excluded transactions.
Borough; provided, however, that the Borough and any other political
subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or transfer may
agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate
herein provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total
of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local
Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
A. The tax imposed by § 170-24 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation, which reconveyance may include property-line
adjustments, provided that said reconveyance is made within one
year from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which the Borough is prohibited from taxing under the
Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax-delinquent property at sheriff sale or Tax
Claim Bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passes by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
§ 170-24 PERKASIE CODE § 170-26
152:564
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of
a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or
the spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by
the grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor
were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to
successor trustee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the Department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
(13) A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
(a) The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona-fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona-fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.
(17) Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.
(18) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954
[68A Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its primary
purpose preservation of land for historic, recreational, scenic,

may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the
reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

152:566
§ 170-27. Documents.
Except as otherwise provided in § 170-26, documents which make, confirm
or evidence any transfer or demise of title to real estate between
associations or corporations and the members, partners, shareholders or
stockholders thereof are fully taxable. For the purposes of this article,
corporations and associations are entities separate from their members,
partners, stockholders or shareholders.
§ 170-28. Acquired companies.
§ 170-29. Credits against tax.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company; and, of itself or together
with prior changes, has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or

or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation
under this article.
C. Within 30 days after becoming an acquired company, the company shall
present a declaration of acquisition with the Recorder of each county in
which it holds real estate for the affixation of documentary stamps and
recording. Such declaration shall set forth the value of real estate
holdings of the acquired company in such county. A copy of the
Pennsylvania realty transfer tax declaration of acquisition may be
submitted for this purpose.
A. Where there is a transfer of a residential property by a licensed real
estate broker, which property was transferred to him within the

upon the transfer.
B. Where there is a transfer by a builder of residential property which was
transferred to the builder within the preceding year as consideration
for the purchase of new, previously unoccupied residential property, a
credit for the amount of the tax paid at the time of the transfer to the

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of the Pennsylvania realty transfer tax,
without compensation from the Borough.

A. For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging
in an occupation with a primary place of employment within the
Borough of Perkasie during the tax year.
B. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of time
during any tax year shall pay the tax for that year in the amount of $47,
assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
C. This tax may be used solely for the following purposes as the same may
be allocated by the Borough Council from time to time:
(1) Emergency services, which shall include emergency medical
services, police services and/or fire services;
(2) Road construction and/or maintenance;
(3) Reduction of property taxes; or
(4) Property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and
farmstead exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 85,
Subchapter F (relating to homestead property exclusion).
D. The Borough shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived from the

year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar
year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for
that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a

§ 170-40 PERKASIE CODE § 170-42
152:576
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total, one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and
with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Borough
utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the
exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall
have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2
forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to
the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until
otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Borough that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal to
or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within
the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax
from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
§ 170-42 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 170-42
152:577
§ 170-43. Duty of employers to collect.
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue
collection under this act.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from a local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
(NOTE: With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425; with respect
to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426.) Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to
remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is
later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for
amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Borough Manager or the Collector shall determine eligibility for
refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
A. Each employer within the Borough of Perkasie, as well as those
employers situated outside the Borough of Perkasie but who engage in
business within the Borough of Perkasie, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the Borough of Perkasie and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the Borough of
Perkasie.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
§ 170-42 PERKASIE CODE § 170-43
152:578
§ 170-44. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of
a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 140-42B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 170-43 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL § 170-45
152:579
§ 170-45. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 170-46. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the Borough of Perkasie shall be required to comply
with this part and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on
or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 170-47. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 170-48. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the Borough of Perkasie but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
Borough of Perkasie do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the Borough of Perkasie. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the Borough of Perkasie and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and

the one-hundred-year flood plain. The Flood District is a special zone
which overlies and supercedes rights granted by any provision of

to promote and encourage a unified district for airport supportive
commercial uses and other supportive/ancillary services, to capture the
economic benefits of proximity to the Pennridge Airport in a manner
that balances aviation safety with land uses that provide a transitional
buffer of intensity to surrounding areas. The purpose is to establish a
campus-like setting for a mix of light industrial, manufacturing and
office uses, with support retail, service business and related
establishments and uses which are planned for and developed as a
cohesive district, where access, infrastructure, and other
improvements are coordinated by integrating uses on one or more lots.

appropriate professional. The study shall demonstrate that the
proposed parking supply will be adequate to serve the parking
needs of the proposed use.
(c) Borough Council may, in its sole discretion and as part of the
subdivision/land development approval process, permit shared
parking and/or reserved parking. For properties with
woodlands, and where it is feasible, any reserve parking shall
be located in areas of woodlands in an attempt to protect such
woodlands if additional parking is not required for the users,
unless otherwise directed by Borough Council as part of the
subdivision/land development approval process. If reserved
parking is provided, Borough Council shall have the right to
require the reserved parking to be constructed in the future if
the Zoning Officer confirms the need for the additional
parking.

a further reduction or elimination of the woodland protection
ratio on the property in exchange for the applicant installing a
replacement tree for every tree removed over the permitted
70% disturbance; provided, however, if such replacement trees
cannot be installed on the property, after taking into account
§ 186-20 WATER § 186-20
185:749
the landscaping requirements and other development
requirements in this chapter, the applicant shall be permitted
to make a contribution to the Borough to plant replacement
trees in other places in the Borough, in an amount determined
by Borough Council, as part of the subdivision/land
development approval process.

General Performance Standards
§ 186-46. Compliance required.
All uses and activities established after the effective date of this chapter
shall comply with the following performance standards.
§ 186-47. Noise.
A. The sound level of any operation (other than the operation of motor
vehicles or other transportation facilities, operations involved in the
construction or demolition of structures, emergency alarm signals or
time signals) shall not exceed the decibel levels in the designated
octave bands and center frequency as stated below. The sound pressure
level shall be measured with a sound level meter and an octave band
analyzer that conforms to specifications published by the American
National Standards Institute, Inc. [American National Standard
Specification for Sound Level Meters, S1. 4-1971, American National
Standards Institute, Inc., New York and the American Standard
Specification for Octave, Half-Octave and Third-Octave Band Filter
Sets, S1. 11-1966 (R 1971), American Standards Association, Inc., New

§ 186-51. Odorous emissions.
No use shall emit odorous gases or other odorous matter in such quantities
as to be offensive at any point on or beyond its lot lines. The guide for
determining such quantities of offensive odors shall be the 50 Percent
Response Level of Table 1 (Odor Thresholds in Air), Research on Chemical
Odors: Part I - Odor Thresholds for 53 Commercial Chemicals, October
1968, Manufacturing Chemists Association, Inc., Washington, D.C.
§ 186-52. Outdoor lighting.
A. General standards: Outdoor lighting for all residential and
nonresidential uses shall be designed to minimize undesirable offpremises
effects.
(1) No use shall produce glare off the premises by illumination
originating on the premises. Glare is defined as the sensation
produced by light within the visual field that is sufficiently greater
than the light to which the eyes are adapted and which causes
annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance or visibility,
for any period of time, no matter how short in duration.
(2) No bare or direct light source shall be visible beyond the lot lines.
All lights shall have a full cutoff fixture, which is defined as a light
fixture with light distribution pattern that results in no light being
projected at or above a natural plane located at the bottom of the
fixture. This applies to all pole-mounted lights, building-mounted
lights, sign lights, walkway lights, and any other type of
illumination. No light shall shine directly into windows or onto
streets and driveways off the premises. These standards shall not
apply to holiday lights that are temporarily displayed during
holiday seasons.
(3) Outdoor light fixtures lawfully installed prior to and operable on
the effective date of this amendment to the zoning chapter are
exempt from all requirements of this chapter. There shall be no
change in use or lamp type, or any replacement (except for sametype
and same-output lamp replacement) or structural alteration
made, without conforming to all applicable requirements of this
chapter. Further, if the property is abandoned, or if there is a
change in use or ownership of the property, the provisions of this
chapter will apply when the abandonment ceases or the new use or
ownership commences.
B. Types of pole-mounted lights permitted: Lighting shall be provided by
fixtures with a height not more than 18 feet above finished grade in all
zoning districts. Height shall be measured from the ground to the
uppermost point of the light fixture. Light fixtures shall be fully shielded
fixtures where the light source is not visible from the property line.
Borough Council may consider other type of light fixtures, provided that
the intent of this chapter is met.
§ 186-51 WATER § 186-52
185:759
§ 186-53. Vibrations.
No use shall cause earth vibrations or concussions detectable beyond its
lot lines without the aid of instruments, with the exception of that vibration
produced as a result of construction activity.
§ 186-54. Buffering.
C. Lighting plan required: Any outdoor lighting such as pole-mounted,
building, sign, canopy, or sidewalk illumination, and driveway lights,
shall be shown on the lighting plan in sufficient detail to allow
determination of the effects to adjacent properties, traffic safety, and
overhead sky glow.
D. Light at the property line: Illumination from light originating on the site
shall not exceed 0.5 footcandles at the lot line. Overhead light pollution
caused by unshielded or bright lights shall not be permitted.
E. Maximum lighting levels: The maximum lighting level at areas within
each Borough property shall not exceed five footcandles at building
entrances and three footcandles elsewhere on the lot.
A. Buffering serves to soften the outline of buildings, to screen glare and
noise and to create a visual and/or physical barrier between conflicting
land uses. Except in cases of lot line adjustments, buffer yards are
required between various land uses and along existing and proposed
streets. The extent of buffering required shall be determined by the
type of use proposed and the adjacent uses or streets surrounding the
proposed development. The impact of the proposed use on adjoining
properties is the basis for establishing buffer yard standards.
(1) The standards of this section are minimum design requirements.
The Borough reserves the right to request that the minimum
requirements listed herein be exceeded if conditions so warrant. All
landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect familiar
with this section to promote the proper use and arrangement of
plant materials.
B. To determine the required buffer yard and planting schedule, a threestep
procedure shall be followed:
(1) Step 1: site analysis and determination of buffer yard class.
(2) Step 2: selection of the planting option for the buffer class.
(3) Step 3: selection of the plant materials from the plant materials list.
C. Step 1: site analysis and determination of buffer yard class.
(1) For each property boundary, the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land use or road classification. Land use information shall
be determined by an on-site survey, and this chapter shall be
§ 186-52 PERKASIE CODE § 186-54
185:760
utilized to determine road classifications. Table 1 below specifies
the buffer yard class for each boundary.202
(2) The applicant shall match his proposed land use with the
corresponding adjacent land use or road classification for each
property boundary. The letter indicates the buffer yard class.
(3) If other uses are determined to be potential conflicts or where
unique site conditions warrant, the applicant shall provide a buffer
class as specified by Borough Council, upon recommendation by
the Borough Planning Commission.
D. Step 2: selection of the planting option for the buffer class.
(1) After determining the buffer class, the applicant shall select a
planting option from Table 2 to meet the buffer yard requirement
for each boundary. The Borough may consider an alternate planting
option which shall have a screening capability equal to or greater
than any of the available options.
(2) Table 2: Planting options. The options below indicate the amount of
plant material that is required per linear foot of property line.
Plantings aligned on property or right-of-way boundaries shall be
located one foot to five feet inside of the boundary line. Plantings
are not required to be aligned on property or right-of-way
boundaries and may be sited on any portion of the buffer yard for
buffering purposes. The Borough may permit staggering or
grouping of plant materials if a satisfactory buffer is achieved.
Class Option
A Within a 10-foot buffer yard: 1 canopy tree per 40 feet of
boundary; or 1 flowering tree per 30 feet of boundary.
B Within a 15-foot buffer yard: 1 canopy tree per 40 feet and
1 flowering tree per 60 feet of boundary; or 1 canopy tree
per 40 feet and 1 evergreen tree per 30 feet; or a 4-foot
high opaque fence and 1 flowering tree per 40 feet.
C Within a 20-foot buffer yard: 1 evergreen tree per 20 feet
and 1 flowering tree per 60 feet of boundary; or a hedge
or large shrub (4 foot centers) along property boundary
and 1 evergreen tree per 25 feet of boundary; or an
opaque fence 4 feet high and 1 flowering tree per 40 feet
and 1 shrub per 20 feet.
D Within a 50-foot buffer yard: 2 staggered rows of
evergreen trees spaced no more than 20 feet apart; or a
combination of trees and shrubs which achieve a similar
level of vegetative density; or an opaque fence 6 feet high
and 1 canopy tree per 40 feet.
202. Editor's Note: Said table is included is an attachment to this chapter.
§ 186-54 WATER § 186-54
185:761
E. Step 3: selection of plant materials from the plant materials list.
(1) Each planting option may utilize any of the plant materials outlined
in Table 3. Minimum plant size, given either in height or caliper, is
indicated on this table. The Borough may permit other planting
types if they are hardy to the area, are not subject to blight or
disease, and are of the same general character and growth habit as
those listed in Table 3. All planting material shall meet the
standards of American Nursery and Landscape Association (ANLA).
(2) Where vegetation, topography, or man-made structures exist which
can meet the objectives of the buffer requirements, they may be
preserved and may be used to meet the buffer and planting
requirements. Quantities, size, species, and locations of existing
plant materials and other features must be shown on plans and
verified by the Borough. Where the Borough allows existing
vegetation and features to be counted toward meeting the buffer
requirements of this chapter, the vegetation or features shall not be
removed and shall be protected by recorded plan note to insure
that it remains as a part of the subdivision or land development.

property line.
[2] The buffer yard may overlap the required front, side, or
rear yards and, in case of conflict, the larger yard
requirements shall apply. The lot shall provide a minimum
of 10 feet of usable, nonbuffer yard between the rear of the
principal structure and the required buffer yard setback
line.
§ 186-54 PERKASIE CODE § 186-54
185:764
[3] The buffer yard may be part of the lot area assigned to a
dwelling unit. A deed restriction conforming to the
dimensions of the buffer yard shall be placed on the lot.
[4] All buffer yards shall be maintained and kept clean of all
debris, rubbish, and weeds.
[5] No structure, play structure, driveway, sign, stormwater
detention facility, manufacturing or processing activity,
commercial activity, parking, storage or display of
materials shall be permitted in the buffer yard, except that
a driveway may cross a required buffer area in order to
connect the street with a parking area or driveway lying

a required buffer yard as specified in this section.
[6] Required plant materials shall be permanently maintained
and any plant material which dies shall be replaced.
(b) Planting requirements near overhead utility lines. Where trees
are to be planted near overhead power lines, the following
requirements shall be met:
[1] If trees are to be planted within 15 feet of a utility pole or
line, measured along the ground from the base of the pole,
only trees which grow no taller than 25 feet shall be
planted.
[2] If trees are to be planted within 15 feet to 25 feet of a
utility pole or line, measured along the ground from the
base of the pole, only trees which grow no taller than 40
feet shall be planted.
(c) Guarantee: All plant material shall be guaranteed for 18
months from the day of final approval of the landscape
installation by the Borough in accordance with the provisions
of the Borough's developer's agreements, escrow agreements,
and maintenance agreements. Any plant material 25% or more
of which is dead shall be considered dead. A tree shall be
considered dead when the main leader has died or 25% or
more of the crown is dead. Any dead plant material shall be
replaced and installed according to the approved planting
practices.
(d) Berming shall be provided where the Borough determines that,
due to topography or other factors, the buffer classes in Table
1203 do not provide an adequate buffer between adjoining
incompatible uses.
203. Editor's Note: Said table is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 186-54 WATER § 186-54
185:765
§ 186-55. Transportation impact study.
(e) In general, to prevent the planting of a monoculture, at least
two different genus of each type of plant should be specified.
F. Supplemental regulations. The minimum buffer requirement to be
provided by either Open Space Preservation Performance Subdivision 1
or Open Space Preservation Performance Subdivision II shall be a Class
C twenty-foot buffer yard. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of
this chapter, the required buffer yard for an Open Space Preservation
Performance Subdivision I and Open Space Preservation Performance
Subdivision II may be permitted within the rear or side yards of
individual lots and may be included in the area of required open space.
Any portion of the required buffer yard located on an individual lot shall
be subject to a restriction prohibiting disturbance of or construction
within the buffer yard. [Added 10-6-2014 by Ord. No. 978]
A. Requirement for transportation impact study. A transportation impact
study shall be required for all rezoning applications and in all
applications for a zoning variance, special exception and conditional
use to enable the Borough and/or the Zoning Hearing Board to assess
the impact of a proposed rezoning or zoning application on the local
transportation systems, both highways and public transportation. The
purpose of the study is to ensure that the proposed rezoning or zoning
application does not adversely affect the transportation network and to
identify any traffic problems that may be created in the existing
highway network as a result of the rezoning or zoning relief and to
delineate solutions to potential problems and to present improvements
to be incorporated into the proposed rezoning or zoning relief or to the
highway and/or public transportation systems within the designated
study area. The study shall assist in the protection of air quality, the
conservation of energy and the encouragement of public transportation
use.
B. The transportation impact study shall be performed in accordance with
the provisions set forth in Chapter 164, Article III, § 164-41.2, titled,
"Transportation impact study."
C. The transportation impact study shall be submitted as part of all
rezoning applications and zoning applications that have the potential of
generating 250 or more trips per day. Where doubt exists as to the need
for the study, the applicant shall seek guidance from the Borough
Engineer or his/her designee. The application shall not be considered
complete until the transportation impact study is submitted to the
Borough in accordance with the provisions of this section and
§ 164-41.2. Council may, at its discretion, require any other application
to be accompanied by a transportation impact study, provided that
Council notifies the applicant immediately following Council's first
meeting to consider the proposal. Such notification shall specify the
reason for the requirement, citing the proposal's particular location or
existing problems or type of use (e.g., generation of heavy truck traffic).
§ 186-54 PERKASIE CODE § 186-55
185:766
§ 186-56. Site capacity calculation.
Each site is unique. It has physical features which are rarely precisely
duplicated on another site. Portions of some sites may not be usable, and
a minimum amount of buildable land should be retained for recreation.
The purpose of this section is to determine the appropriate intensity of use
to which a specific tract may be put. For each tract that is five acres or
larger in R-1A and R-1B Residential Districts, the developer shall include
the following calculation with the initial plan submission.
D. Submission procedures and implementation.
(1) Time of submission. The transportation impact study shall be
submitted to the Borough of Perkasie or the Zoning Hearing Board
with the rezoning or zoning application. In the case of rezoning
applications, a copy of the study shall also be submitted to the
Bucks County Planning Commission.
(2) Implementation. The Perkasie Borough Planning Commission, the
Bucks County Planning Commission (in the case of rezoning
applications only), the Perkasie Borough Engineer and the Perkasie
Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board shall review the
transportation impact study to analyze its adequacy in identifying
solutions to traffic problems that may occur either totally, or in part
as a result of the application. Transportation improvements
required in order to eliminate deficient conditions may be required.
These necessary improvements may be attached to the conditions
of approval set forth by the Borough or the Zoning Hearing Board
prior to approval.
A. Base site area: Certain portions of tract may not be usable for the
activities proposed for the site; these shall therefore be subtracted from
the site area to determine base site area.
(1) Site area as determined by actual on-site survey (acres).
(2) Subtract: land within ultimate right-of-way of existing roads or
utility rights-of-way or easements (acres).
(3) Subtract: land which is not contiguous, i.e., a separate parcel which
does not abut or adjoin nor share common boundaries with the rest
of the development, and/or land which is cut off from the main
parcel by a road, railroad, existing land use or major stream so as
to serve as a major barrier to common use or so that is isolated and
unavailable for building purposes (acres).
(4) Subtract: land which in a previously approved subdivision was
reserved for resource reasons, such as flooding or recreation
(acres).
(5) Subtract: land used or zoned for another use, i.e., land which is
used or to be used for commercial or industrial uses in a residential
§ 186-55 WATER § 186-56
185:767
development, or land in a different zoning district than the primary
use (acres).
(6) Equals base site area (acres).
B. Resource protection land: All land within the base site area shall be
mapped and measured for the purpose of determining the amount of
open space needed to protect it.
(1) The resource protection land equals, for each resource, the acres of
land in the resource multiplied by the open space ratio for that
resource. The open space ratios are as follows: [Amended
3-16-2015 by Ord. No. 985]
Resources Open Space Ratio
Floodplain district 1.00
Soils on floodplain 1.00
Watercourses, waters of the
commonwealth
1.00
Steep slope (25% or more) 0.85
Steep slope (15% to 25%) 0.70
Steep slope (8% to 15%) 0.60
Wetlands 1.00
Wetland buffer 0.80
Woodlands
Environmentally sensitive 0.80
Other 0.50
(2) The total land with resource restrictions equals the total of all the
acres of land in each resource.
(3) The total resource protection land equals the total of all the lands
resulting from the calculation in § 186-56B(1).
C. Determination of site capacity: Individual site capacity is based on net
buildable site area. For single-family cluster or performance standard
subdivisions, the number of allowable dwelling units is determined by
multiplying the density by net buildable site area. The calculations are
as follows:
(1) The base site area (acres) multiplied by the open space ratio [see
§ 186-20A(3), 186-20B(4), and 186-20B(5)] equals the minimum
required open space.
(2) The base site area (acres) minus the total resource protection land
or minimum required open space, whichever is greater (acres)
equals the net buildable site area.
§ 186-56 PERKASIE CODE § 186-56
185:768
§ 186-57. Environmental performance standards.
(3) The net buildable site area (acres) multiplied by the density [see
§ 186-20A(3), § 186-20B(4), and § 186-20B(5)] equals the number of
dwelling units (do not round up).
A. Floodplains: All such lands shall remain as permanent open space,
except that roads and utilities may cross the floodplain where design
approval is obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection and where other applicable ordinances,
regulations and statutes are complied with.
B. Soils on floodplain: All such land shall remain as permanent open space,
except that roads may cross these soils where design approval is
obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and that recreational, conservation or agricultural open
space uses shall be permitted. Where floodplains are defined, they shall
be used rather than soils on floodplain. [Amended 3-16-2015 by Ord.
No. 985]
C. Steep slopes: In areas of steep slopes, the following standards shall
apply:
(1) No more than 40% of steep slopes (8% to 15%) shall be altered,
regraded, cleared or built upon. The remaining 60% shall
permanently remain undisturbed in existing natural cover and as
permanent open space.
(2) No more than 30% of steep slopes (15% to 25%) shall be altered,
regraded, cleared, or built upon. The remaining 70% shall
permanently remain in existing natural cover and as permanent
open space.
(3) No more than 15% of steep slopes (25% or more) shall be altered,
regraded, cleared, or built upon. The remaining 85% shall
permanently remain in existing natural cover and as permanent
open space.
D. Watercourses, waters of the commonwealth: These areas shall be left as
permanent open space and free flowing. Such areas shall not be
altered, regraded, filled, piped, diverted or built upon, unless design
approval is obtained from the Borough and the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection as required.
E. Wetlands.
(1) All such lands shall remain as permanent open space. No
development, grading, filling, piping, diverting, or disturbance of
any kind shall be permitted in wetlands except that bridges, roads,
and utilities may cross wetlands where design approval is obtained
from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
and the United States Army Corps of Engineers or their successor
§ 186-56 WATER § 186-57
185:769
§ 186-58. Open space standards. [Added 10-6-2014 by Ord. No. 978]
On any site developed for an Open Space Preservation Performance
Subdivision I or Open Space Preservation Performance Subdivision II
development, naturalized stormwater management facilities in accordance
agencies, and where other applicable ordinances, regulations and
statutes are complied with.
(2) All wetland determinations shall be performed by the Army Corp of
Engineers or by an independent party certified by the Army Corp of
Engineers to be expert in wetland delineations, in which case a
copy of such certification shall be provided with the subdivision or
land development application and all wetland delineations shall be
attested to and sealed.
(3) At the time of application, the applicant shall file for review a
wetlands report that shall identify and delineate all wetlands on the
plan set in sufficient detail as to make on-site verification possible.
All wetland areas shall be clearly staked at the time of application
and throughout the review period to allow the entire perimeter of
the wetland area(s) to be located.
F. Wetlands buffer: In addition to the wetlands preservation, a buffer of
100 feet shall be maintained from the limits of any wetland as
delineated through the requirements in § 186-57E, in order to minimize
hydrologic modifications and potential for pollution. Within the buffer
area, an eighty-percent existing natural cover must be undisturbed and
maintained as permanent open space. The remaining 20% of the buffer
area may be disturbed. Any permanent wetland crossing in the buffer
area shall be part of the twenty-percent maximum allowable
encroachment.
G. Woodlands: In areas of woodlands, the following standards shall apply:
(1) No more than 20% of a woodland area associated with another
environmentally sensitive resource shall be altered, regraded,
cleared, or built upon. The remaining 80% shall permanently
remain in existing natural cover. For the purposes of this section
(§ 186-57G), an environmentally sensitive resource shall include
floodplains, soils on floodplain, steep slopes (15% and greater),
wetlands, and wetland buffers. [Amended 3-16-2015 by Ord. No.
985]
(2) No more than 50% of a woodland area not associated with another
environmentally sensitive resource shall be altered, regraded,
cleared or built upon. The remaining 50% shall permanently
remain in existing natural cover.
H. Tree protection zone: Such areas shall be 100% open space. No land
within the tree protection zone shall be altered, regarded, compacted,
or built upon or used for storage or parking of vehicles.
§ 186-57 PERKASIE CODE § 186-58
185:770
with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection BMP
Manual and approved by the Borough Engineer, shall be permitted in the
required open space. Additional stormwater management facilities,
including retention basins, shall be limited to 20% of the required open
space area on a site, at the discretion of the Borough Engineer.

article so long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that
any parking facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced below such requirements.
B. Change in requirements. Whenever there is an alteration of a structure
or a change or extension of a use which increases the parking
requirements according to the standards of § 186-61, the total
additional parking required for the alteration, change or extension shall
be provided in accordance with the requirements of that section.
C. Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any use that

long as the use exists which the facilities were designed to serve.
(2) Off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced in total extent after
their provision, except upon the approval of the Zoning Hearing
Board and then only after proof that, by reason of diminution of
floor area, seating area, the number of employees or change in
other factors controlling the regulation of the number of parking
spaces, such reduction is in conformity with the requirements of
this article.
(3) Reasonable precautions shall be taken by the owner or sponsor of
particular uses to assure the availability of required facilities to the
§ 186-61 PERKASIE CODE § 186-62
185:780
employees or other persons for whom the facilities are designed to
serve. Such facilities shall be designed and used in such a manner
as to at no time constitute a nuisance or a hazard or unreasonable
impediment to traffic.
F. Common parking facility. Two or more uses may provide for required
parking in a common parking lot if the total space provided is not less
than the sum of the spaces required for each use individually. However,
the number of spaces required in a common parking facility may be
reduced below this total by special exception under Article XI if it can
be demonstrated to the Zoning Hearing Board that the hours or days of
peak parking needed for the uses are so different that a lower total will
provide adequately for all uses served by the facility.
G. Fractional parking calculation. Where the computation of required
parking spaces shall be in a fractional number, any fraction of the next
highest number shall be counted as one.
H. Location of parking areas. Required off-street parking spaces shall be
on the same lot or premises with the principal use served or, where this
requirement cannot be met, within 300 feet of the principal use served
and within the same district. The applicant or developer shall provide
proof of the availability of parking spaces which are not needed to meet
the requirements of another use within 300 feet of the premises and
which can be used for parking purposes by the applicant. If spaces are
leased, the Borough shall require proof of the leasing arrangement to
be kept on file. Proof of ongoing leases will be required.
I. Maintenance of parking areas. For parking areas of three or more
vehicles, the area not landscaped and so maintained, including
driveways, shall be graded, surfaced with asphalt or other suitable
material and drained to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer to the
extent necessary to prevent dust, erosion or excessive water flow
across streets or adjoining property.
J. Reduction of nonresidential parking requirements. In order to prevent
the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces than is
actually required to serve the needs of nonresidential uses, Borough
Council, after consulting with the Planning Commission and Borough
Engineer, may permit a conditional reduction of parking space through
either joint use or reservation of land for future parking.
(1) Joint use: The number of spaces required in a common parking
facility may be reduced below this total if it can be demonstrated
that the hours or days of peak parking needed for the uses are
different and that a lower total will provide adequately for uses
served by the parking area. The total number of spaces shall not be
less than 75% of what would be required under strict ordinance
interpretation.
(2) Reservation of land for future parking: The design of the parking
lot, as indicated on the land development plan, must designate

The plan also shall illustrate the layout for the total number of
parking spaces which must be in compliance with the impervious
surface and yard requirements of this chapter.
(a) The balance of the parking area reserved shall not include
areas for required buffer yards, setbacks, or area which
otherwise would be unsuitable for parking spaces due to the
physical characteristics of the land or other requirements of
this chapter. This parking area which is reserved shall be
landscaped and shall be located so that it can be used for
additional parking spaces if required.
(b) The developer shall enter into a written agreement with
Borough Council that, after one year following the issuing of
the last occupancy permit, the additional parking spaces shall
be provided at the developer's or owner's expense should it be
determined at the sole discretion of Borough Council that the
required number of parking spaces are necessary to satisfy the
need of the land development. The applicant shall establish a
performance bond with adequate security to cover the cost of
paving the additional spaces and shall enter into an agreement
with the Borough to ensure that the paving will be provided by
the current or any future owners when it is determined the
paving is needed.
A. Parking lot dimensions shall be no less than those listed in the following

including traffic signs and similar regulatory notices, shall be
allowed within five feet of the rear edge of a sidewalk and within 10
feet behind the proposed curbline of the street in those areas not
having a sidewalk. The proposed curbline shall be determined by
reference to the existing ordinance of Perkasie Borough which

such ordinance, by reference to the cartway width specified for the
classification of said street as set forth in § 164-20 of the Code of

(2) No person shall affix, by any means, a sign to any electric or light
pole, facility or structure of the Borough without the Borough's
authorization.

through glare, through blocking of reasonable sight lines for
streets, sidewalks or driveways, through confusion with a traffic
control device (by reason of color, location, shape or other

questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption,
which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after
the effective date of said ordinance.

limited to the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act on the
application therefore, or the issuance of any cease and desist order.
D. Applications for variances pursuant to § 186-101 of this chapter.
E. Applications for special exceptions pursuant to § 186-102 of this
chapter.
F. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and
stormwater management insofar as the same relate to developments
not involving applications for subdivisions or land developments, as
defined by the Act, as amended.
G. Appeals from a determination by the Borough Engineer or Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or flood
hazard ordinance.
H. Appeals from a determination by the Zoning Officer involving the
interpretation of any provision of this chapter, including the

the enforcement of this chapter.
I. Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under Section 916.2 of

§ 186-99 WATER § 186-101
185:809
§ 186-101. Variances.
The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of the zoning chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and
may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may
grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
§ 186-102. Special exceptions.
Where this chapter has provided for stated special exceptions to be granted
or denied by the Board pursuant to express standards and criteria, the
Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in
accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
§ 186-103. Additional factors to be considered.
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
the provisions of the zoning chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of the zoning chapter and that the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible
of the regulation in issue.
F. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter.

related to a use or activity within the Floodplain District, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall refer to Chapter 94, Floodplain Management, of
the Code of the Borough of Perkasie.
B. Special exceptions and/or variances shall only be issued after the Board
has determined that the granting of such will not result in additional
threats to the public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with the
local laws or ordinances.

the Board fails to render the decision within the period required by
this subsection or fails to commence, conduct or complete the required

have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has

decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the
failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as herein above
provided, the Board shall give public notice of said decision within
10 days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in
the same manner as provided in Subsection A of this section. If the

officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal
or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and
proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such

§ 186-108. Stay of proceedings.
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in § 186-106 and during its
pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant
to any challenged chapter, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or
of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed
in accordance with the provisions of Section 915.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.
§ 186-109. through § 186-110. (Reserved)
§ 186-111. Validity of chapter; substantive questions.
predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner
to appeal from an adverse decision by a zoning officer on a challenge
to the validity of an ordinance or map pursuant to Section 916.2 of the
Act, as amended, shall preclude an appeal from a final approval.
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
A. A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits
or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest
shall submit the challenge either:
(1) To the Zoning Hearing Board under § 186-100A of this chapter or;
(2) To the Borough Council under § 186-114.1D of this chapter,
together with a request for a curative amendment.
B. Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of
another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desire to
challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their
challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon under
§ 186-100A of this chapter.
C. The submissions referred to in Subsections A and B shall be governed
by the following;
(1) In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging
party shall make a written request to the Zoning Hearing Board
that it hold a hearing on its challenge. The request shall contain the
reasons for the challenge. Where the landowner desires to
challenge the validity of such ordinance and elects to proceed by
curative amendment, his application to the Borough Council shall
contain, in addition to the requirements of the written request
hereof, the plans and explanatory materials describing the use or
development proposed by the landowner in lieu of the use or
development permitted by the challenged ordinance or map. Such
plans or other materials shall not be required to meet the standards
§ 186-107 WATER § 186-111
185:815
prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the
issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable notice
of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for
evaluating the challenged ordinance or map in light thereof.
Nothing herein contained shall preclude the landowner from first
seeking a final approval before submitting his challenge.
(2) If the submission is made by the landowner to the Borough Council
under Subsection A(2), the request also shall be accompanied by an
amendment or amendments to the ordinance proposed by the
landowner to cure the alleged defects therein.
(3) If the submission is made to the Borough Council, the Borough
Solicitor shall represent and advise it at the hearing or hearings.
(4) The Borough Council may retain an independent attorney to
present the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its
behalf and to present its witnesses on its behalf.
(5) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be,
shall determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is
defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a challenge heard by the
Borough Council is found to have merit, the Council may accept a
landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision, or may
adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged
defects. If a challenge heard by the Zoning Hearing Board is found
to have merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall
include recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance
which will cure the defects found. In reaching its decision, the
Zoning Hearing Board or the Borough Council, as the case may be,
shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory material
submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available
to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources
and natural features, the degree to which these are protected
or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development
and any adverse environmental impacts.
§ 186-111 PERKASIE CODE § 186-111
185:816
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(6) The Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may
be, shall render its decision within 45 days after the conclusion of
the last hearing.
(7) If the Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case
may be, fails to act on the landowner's request within the time
limits referred to in Subsection C(6), a denial of the request is
deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last
hearing.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be,
shall commence its hearings within 60 days after the request is filed
unless the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time. The
hearings shall be conducted in accordance with §§ 186-104F through J
of this chapter.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the
ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory
material or proposed amendments, may be examined by the public.
F. The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be,
fails to commence the hearing within the time limits set forth in
Subsection C;
(2) The Borough Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment;
(3) The Borough Council adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner; or
(4) The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be,
fails to act on the request 45 days after the close of the last hearing
on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by
the landowner and municipality.
G. Where, after the effective date of this chapter, a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application
by the Borough Council pursuant to § 186-114.1D of this chapter or a
validity challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to
§ 186-100A of this chapter or the Court acts finally on appeal from
denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge and the
proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two years
from the date of such approval to file an application for preliminary
approval pursuant to Chapter 164, Subdivision and Land Development,
§ 186-111 WATER § 186-111
185:817
§ 186-112. Court appeals.
All appeals from all land use decisions rendered pursuant to this chapter
shall be taken to the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district wherein
the land is located and shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
decision, or in the case of a deemed decision, within 30 days after the notice
of said deemed decision is given as set forth in § 186-105K of this chapter.
Such appeals shall be made in accordance with the Act, as amended.
of the Code of the Borough of Perkasie. Within the two-year period,
no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision and
land development or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied
in any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as
granted in the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge.
Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment application
or the validity challenge is approved but does not require further
application under any subdivision or land development ordinance, the
developer shall have one year within which to file for a building permit
within the one-year period, no subsequent change or amendment in the
zoning, subdivision and land development or other governing ordinance
or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the
right of the applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the
sustained validity challenge. During these protected periods, the Court
shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such
supplemental relief as may be necessary.
H. If the Borough does not accept a landowner's curative amendment and
a court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the court's
decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for the entire
Zoning Ordinance and Map, but only for those provisions which
specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment and
challenge.
I. A landowner who has challenged on substantive grounds the validity of
a zoning ordinance or map either by submission of a curative
amendment to the governing body under Subsection A(2) or to the
Zoning Hearing Board under § 186-100A shall not submit any additional
substantive challenges involving the same parcel, group of parcels or
part thereof until such time as the status of the landowner's original
claim has been finally determined or withdrawn; provided, however,
that if after the date of the landowner's original challenge the
municipality adopts a substantially different zoning ordinance or zoning
map, the landowner may file a second substantive challenge to the new
or different zoning ordinance or zoning map under Subsection A.

project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend
a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the
approach surface and at 90° to the extended runway centerline.
TREE  Any object of natural growth.
C. Airport hazard zoning boundaries. In order to carry out the provisions
of this chapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones
which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces,
transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they
apply to the Pennridge Airport. Such zones are shown on the Pennridge
Airport Imaginary Surfaces Map which is attached to this chapter and
made a part hereof.204 An area located in more than one of the following
zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined
as follows:
(1) Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/
4 mile nonprecision instrument approach surface zone. The inner
edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface
and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the
primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline
of the runway.
204. Editor's Note: Said map is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 186-130 WATER § 186-130
185:831
(2) Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
(3) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual
and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the
primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs
by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does
not include the approach and transitional zones.
(4) Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends
outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
D. Airport zone height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained and no
tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a
height in excess of the applicable height herein established for such
zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each
of the zones in question as follows:
(1) Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/
4 mile nonprecision instrument approach surface zone. Slopes 34
feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway
centerline.
(2) Transitional zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150
feet above the airport elevation which is 567 feet above mean sea
level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height
limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface and
extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
(3) Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation
or at a height of 717 feet above mean sea level.
(4) Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet
above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet
above the airport elevation.
(5) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any
structure or growth of any tree to a height up to 35 feet above the
surface of the land.
E. Use Restriction. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this
§ 186-130 PERKASIE CODE § 186-130
185:832
chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of the pilots using the airport,
impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards,
or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff
or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
F. Nonconforming uses or structures.
(1) The regulations prescribed in this section shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any
nonconforming structure or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of a nonconforming structure, except as provided in
§ 186-130G. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in
the construction, alteration, or intended use of any nonconforming
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior
to the effective date of this chapter and is diligently executed.
(2) Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner
of any existing nonconforming structure is hereby required to
permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Zoning
Officer of Perkasie Borough pursuant to guidelines and regulations
adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United
States Department of Transportation to indicate to the operators of
aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport
obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated
and maintained at the expense of the owners of the Pennridge
Airport.
G. Special airport hazard permits.
(1) Applicability. Except as specifically provided hereunder, no
material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure or
use shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be
planted in any airport hazard zone herein created unless a permit
therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the Zoning
Officer. Each application shall indicate the purpose for which the
permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination
is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a
use inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be granted
unless a variance has been granted in accordance with this section.
(2) Airport hazard exceptions. Nothing contained in any of the
following exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending
to permit the construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth
of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by any
applicable section of this section.
§ 186-130 WATER § 186-130
185:833
(a) In the area lying within the limit of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no special airport hazard permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographical features, such tree or structure
would extend above the height limit prescribed for such zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no special airport hazard permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure because
of terrain, land contour, or topographical features would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach
zones.
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the transitional zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal, no special airport
hazard permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when
such tree or structure because of terrain, land contour or
topographical features would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transitional zones.
(3) Existing uses.
(a) No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment
or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation
than it was on the effective date of this section or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a
permit is made. Before any nonconforming structure may be
replaced, substantially altered or rebuilt or nonconforming
tree allowed to grow higher or replanted, a special airport
hazard permit must be secured authorizing the replacement or
change.
(b) Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt, or any tree allowed to grow
higher or replanted, a special airport hazard permit must be
secured authorizing the replacement or change.
(c) Whenever the Zoning Officer of Perkasie Borough determines
that a nonconforming use, structure or tree has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated or decayed, no special airport hazard permit shall
be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed
the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the
zoning regulations.
(4) Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure, or increase
the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use
§ 186-130 PERKASIE CODE § 186-130
185:834
of property, not in accordance with the airport hazard regulations
prescribed herein, shall apply to the Zoning Hearing Board of
Perkasie Borough for a variance in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this chapter. In addition to the requirements for a
variance contained in this chapter, the application for an airport
hazard variance shall be accompanied by a written determination
from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the
proposal upon the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances may be allowed
where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement
of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and the
relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not
create an airport hazard, will do substantial justice and will be
in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this chapter may
be considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the owner or manager of the
Pennridge Airport for comments as to the aeronautical effects of
the variance. If the owner or manager of the Pennridge Airport
does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt,
the Zoning Hearing Board may act on its own to grant or deny said
application.
(5) Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
may be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or
tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's
expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Zoning Hearing Board this condition may be modified
to require the owner to permit the Pennridge Airport, at its own
expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings
and lights.
(6) Required notification. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
either the Zoning Officer or the Zoning Hearing Board who may
decide to grant a permit or variance under this chapter shall notify
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation of its decision. This
notice shall be in writing and shall be sent so as to reach the
Department of Transportation at least 10 days before the date upon
which the decision is to issue. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed as impairing the rights of any person to judicial review
as provided under Article XI, Hearings, Variances and Zoning
Hearing Board, of this chapter.
