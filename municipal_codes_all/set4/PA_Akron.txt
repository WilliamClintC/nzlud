Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
The repeal of a Code section or ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any provision
contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued or any offense committed, any penalty or
punishment incurred, or any proceeding commenced before the repeal took effect or the
ordinance expired.
When any ordinance repealing a former Code section, ordinance, clause or provision shall
itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former Code section,
ordinance, clause or provision, unless it shall be expressly so provided.
Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same as those ordinances and
regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption of this Code, are intended as a continuation
of such ordinances, resolutions and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of
this Code shall not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any of the
prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this Code or in the ordinance
adopting this consolidation, codification and revision of ordinances and regulations of the Borough
of Akron, it is the intention of the Borough Council that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough
be amended, revised or repealed by implication.
Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain resolutions, that is, actions of
the Borough Council of the Borough of Akron (in written form and designated "resolution") which
did not require prior public notice in accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S.
§ 45101 et seq., at the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions" are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend by their inclusion
herein to require prior public notice before amending, revising or repealing such resolution or
resolutions as may have been included herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough
Council that such actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance (requiring prior
public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
§ 1-107. Normal Numbering.
[Ord. 00037, 10/8/2007]
Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
Whenever other divisions are necessary, chapters shall be divided into subchapters, parts into
subparts and designated with the chapter or part number followed by a capital letter. For instance,
Chapter 1 may be divided into Subchapters 1A and 1B.
Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a chapter and a Part such that the first
number or numbers is the chapter number, followed by a hyphen, followed by the Part number,
followed by the section number within the Part. For example, "§ 1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part
1, Section 1. Similarly, "§ 27-305" designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are necessary, sections shall be divided
into subsections, subsections into paragraphs, paragraphs into subparagraphs, subparagraphs
into clauses, and clauses into subclauses, and subclauses into items, designated as follows:
1. Subsection.
A. Paragraph.

§ 1-108. Special Numbering Problems.
[Ord. 00037, 10/8/2007]
Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary to introduce a new chapter,
part or section between existing chapters, parts or sections, the new chapter, part or section shall
be designated by the addition of a capital letter suffix to the preceding chapter, part or section
number. Thus, a chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A, and
sections in that chapter would be numbered, for instance, "§ 5A-101." If it becomes necessary to
introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6, the new Part would be Part 5A, and sections in
that Part would be numbered, for instance, "§ 5-5A01." A new section introduced between existing
§§ 5-105 and 5-106 would be "§ 5-105.1." When a number of new parts or sections have been
introduced, the chapter or part shall be renumbered.
If it becomes necessary to introduce a subsection between subsections, for instance, Subsections
5 and 6, the new subsection would be numbered Subsection 5.1.
If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a subsection between existing unites, the
entire subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or repeal, the remaining
elements in the overall unit shall retain their old numbers until the overall unit is completely
revised. Prior to revision, the vacated number may be marked:
"(Reserved)"
§ 1-109. Amending Code.
[Ord. 00037, 10/8/2007]
All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which amend, repeal or in any way
affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and
printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters, parts, sections, paragraphs, clauses
or other part or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent
ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie
evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances
omitted are readopted as a new Code by the Borough Council.
Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific reference to the chapter, part,
section and/or subsection number of this Code in the following language:
Amendment or Revision. "Chapter _____, Part _____, Section _____, Subsection _____, is
hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . . . ." The amended or revised provisions may
then be set out in full as desired.
Addition. "Chapter _____, Part _____, Section _____, Subsection _____, is hereby amended
by the addition of the following . . . ." The new provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
Repeal. "Chapter _____, Part _____, Section _____, Subsection _____, is hereby repealed in
its entirety."

It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of this Code be adhered to in
enacting future ordinances. In the event that any ordinance or other enactment be adopted which
does not conform to the numbering system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that such enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or updating this
Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council hereby
acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease of reference and that
the renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code shall not in any manner affect the
validity of said enactment.
§ 1-110. Altering Code.
[Ord. 00037, 10/8/2007]
It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or deletion any part or portion of this
Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any
manner whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the Borough Council.

issue tickets to the owner and/or occupant of the property (real or personal) at issue or to the

serve the ticket by handing it to an adult member of the household or the person in charge of
the residence at the residence of the person to be served, or by leaving or affixing the ticket at

If the person in receipt of a ticket does not pay the penalty within 10 days, such failure shall
make the person subject to a citation for the fines indicated in enforcement of the other
relevant sections of the Code and for collection in judicial proceedings.
The Borough may, with its ticket, direct a person to abate the violation noticed on such ticket
or, if the Borough determines that the immediate abatement of the same by the Borough is
necessary, the Borough may take the necessary action to abate the violation at the violator's
expense.
Abatement.
In all instances where the Borough abates the violation, in addition to the penalty set forth
in the ticket, the Borough is authorized to recover from the offending party, the owner of
the property or the tenant the abatement charges and expenses established by resolution
of the Borough Council.

All funds collected pursuant to former Ord. 254 and the resolutions adopted thereof, shall be hereby

[Ord. 314, 10/4/1982, § 32; as amended by Ord. 00038, 11/12/2007, § 3]
The early retirement benefit shall be provided to a member of the police force with 20 or more
years of service who terminates employment prior to the completion of superannuation retirement
age and service requirements and who files a written application for an early retirement benefit
with the governing body of the municipality. The early retirement benefit shall become effective as
of the date the application is filed with the governing body or the date designated on the
application, whichever is later, and shall be the actuarial equivalent of a partial superannuation
retirement benefit calculated as follows:
A partial superannuation retirement benefit shall be determined by applying the percentage
that the member's years of service bears to the years of service that the member would have
rendered had the member continued to be employed until his superannuation retirement date
to the gross pension amount calculated using the monthly average salary during the
appropriate period prior to his termination of employment.
The actuarial equivalent of the partial superannuation retirement benefit shall be determined
by actuarially reducing the partial superannuation retirement benefit to reflect that it will
commence on the effective date of the early retirement rather than on the date on which the
member would have completed superannuation age and service requirements. The actuarial
reduction shall be calculated using the actuarial assumptions reported in the last actuarial
valuation report filed with the Public Employee Retirement Commission under the Act of
December 18, 1984, P.L. 1005, No. 205, known as the "Municipal Pension Plan Funding
Standard and Recovery Act."

§ 1-635. Deferred Retirement Option Plan.
[Ord. No. 00092, 2/12/2018]
Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
DROP
Deferred retirement option plan.
DROP ACCOUNT
An account established for the purpose of accepting DROP participants' monthly pension
checks, which will remain in the pension trust fund.
Eligibility. Effective January 1, 2018, members of the Akron Borough Police Department who have
not retired prior to the implementation of the DROP program may enter into DROP on the first day
of any month following the date on which the officer reaches his normal retirement date. The
length of DROP participation shall be a maximum of 36 months.
Written Election.
To participate in DROP, the officer must identify a date certain in the future ("termination
date") on which he will cease employment. The termination date can be no sooner than 12
months from the date DROP participation begins, and no later than 36 months from the date
DROP participation begins. Election to participate in DROP is irrevocable, and, therefore,
once an officer elects to participate in DROP, the officer cannot thereafter leave DROP and

resume participation in the Borough's pension plan. However, the officer may cease
employment at any time during DROP participation, but in no event shall the officer's
employment continue after the identified termination date.
The officer shall make the election to participate in DROP by using forms and procedures as
prescribed by the plan trustee. Such election shall be made at least 31 days in advance of the
officer's effective date of participation in the DROP. The documentation that must be executed
before an officer may participate in the DROP program shall include a provision releasing the
Borough from any liability with regard to investment and other losses (subject to the
guaranteed rate of return set forth herein). As a condition precedent to participation in DROP,
the officer must also acknowledge and agree to hold the Borough harmless for any
consequences flowing from the officer's decision to participate in DROP, including, but not
limited to, any tax consequences or other financial or other implications of DROP
participation.
In addition, all retirement documents required by the Police Pension Board Administrator must
be filed and presented to the Borough Council for acceptance and approval of retirement and
payment of pension. Once a retirement application has been approved by the Akron Borough
Council, it is irrevocable.
Limitation on Pension Accrual. As of the effective date of DROP participation, the officer shall no
longer earn or accrue additional years of continuous service for pension purposes, and the officer
shall no longer make any required contributions to the Borough's Police Pension Fund.
Benefit Calculation. For all Borough Police Pension Fund purposes, continuous service of an
officer participating in DROP shall remain as it existed on the day prior to the effective date of
commencement of participation in DROP (the "effective retirement date"). Service thereafter shall
not be recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the
Akron Borough Police Pension Fund. The officer's pension benefit shall remain as it existed on the
effective retirement date. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or
used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the Borough Police Pension
Fund. The pension benefit payable to the officer shall increase only as a result of cost-of-living
adjustments in effect on the effective retirement date or by applicable cost-of-living adjustments
granted thereafter. Entry into the DROP shall be construed as "retirement" for the purposes of
leave sell-back. At the time of entry into the DROP, the participant shall be permitted to sell back
leave as if he or she had retired pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. It is the specific
intent of the parties that sums so paid be captured in the calculation of salary for pension
purposes to the extent permitted by the plan.
Payments to DROP Account. The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had
the officer elected to cease employment and receive a normal retirement benefit instead of
entering DROP shall, upon the officer commencing participation in DROP, be paid into the DROP
account. Payments to the DROP account shall be made only while the member is a participant in
the DROP program. Upon entry into the DROP, an amount equal to the member's monthly
retirement benefit shall be transferred to Akron Borough to be held in an interest-bearing ledger
account in its pension trust fund. Interest shall be compounded and credited monthly at an annual
rate earned by the DROP participant's account that shall not be less than 0% or more than 4.5%.
The DROP shall at all times comply with the annual benefit limitations of IRC § 415 and the
regulations thereunder.
Accrual of Nonpension Benefits. After an officer elects to participate in the DROP program, all
other contractual benefits shall continue to accrue with the exception of those provisions relating
to the Borough's Police Pension Plan and the buyback of any qualifying accrued but unused leave
time. An officer may utilize leave time during the DROP period, but the Borough shall not be
required to buy back any such unused leave time at the end of the DROP period.
Payout.

or officer's beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid to the officer or beneficiary and shall no
longer be paid to the officer's DROP account. Following termination of an officer's
employment pursuant to their participating in the DROP program, the balance in the officer's
DROP account shall be paid pursuant to one of the following options:
The balance of the officer's DROP account, less withholding taxes, if any, remitted to the
Internal Revenue Service, shall be paid within 45 days of receipt of the election form by
the plan from the account to the officer or the officer's surviving beneficiary.
The balance in the officer's DROP account shall be paid within 45 days of the receipt of
the election form by the plan from the account directly to the custodian of an eligible
retirement plan, as defined by Internal Revenue Service Code § 402(c)(8)(B), or in the
case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased DROP
participant, to an eligible retirement plan that is an individual retirement account or an
individual retirement annuity as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 402(c)(9).
If the officer or the officer's beneficiary fails to make an election within 60 days following
the date of termination of DROP participation, then the Borough shall pay the lump sum
as provided in Subsection 8A(1), above.
The form of payment selected by the officer or surviving beneficiary shall comply with the
minimum distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
As a condition of participation in DROP, the officer acknowledges that the Borough plays no
role nor has any responsibility in advising the officer regarding the appropriate payout vehicle.
Accordingly, any officer participating in DROP assumes all financial consequences for his/her
participation in DROP, including, but not limited to, the manner in which a permitted payout
from the DROP account is made. The participating officer agrees to hold the Borough
harmless for any tax or other financial consequences which flow directly or indirectly from the
officer's participation in DROP. It is strongly suggested that officers participating in DROP
obtain appropriate financial advice and guidance.
Disability During DROP.
If an officer becomes temporarily disabled during his participation in DROP, any such time lost
due to disability shall be counted towards the officer's termination date. Upon return to duty,
membership in DROP shall continue with the remaining time left until the officer's termination
date. If eligible, the officer shall receive temporary disability pay in the same amount as
disabled police officers that are not participating in DROP. In no event shall an officer on
temporary disability have the ability to draw from his DROP account. However,
notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, if an officer is disabled and has not
returned to work as of the termination date identified prior to DROP participation, then such
resignation shall take precedence over all other provisions herein, and said officer shall be
required to resign. Nothing contained in this plan shall be construed as conferring any legal
rights upon any officer or other person to the continuation of employment, nor shall
participation in the DROP program supersede or limit in any way the right of the Borough to
grant the officer an honorable discharge based upon an inability to perform his or her full
duties as a police officer.
If an officer is determined to have sustained a permanent work-related injury in the course of
employment, the officer's participation in DROP shall immediately cease. In such case, the
officer shall have the same options for the payout of the officer's DROP account and,
thereafter, shall receive a normal monthly pension benefit payment in the same manner as an
officer who completed his full participation in DROP.

Death.
If an officer participating in DROP dies, the officer's eligibility for the DROP shall terminate
upon the date of death. If such death occurs before the DROP account balances are paid, the
officer's legal beneficiary shall have the same rights as the officer to withdraw or roll over the
account balance.
Except in the case of death benefits specifically payable as a result of death incurred in the
course of performing hazardous public duty, the only death benefits to which a DROP
participant's survivor shall be entitled are those normally payable in the death of a retired
officer.
Forfeiture of Benefits. Notwithstanding an officer's participation in DROP, an officer who is
convicted or pleads guilty to engaging in criminal misconduct which constitutes a "crime related to
public office or public employment," as that phrase is defined in Pennsylvania's Pension Forfeiture
Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311 through 1314, shall forfeit his right to receive a pension, including any
amounts currently deposited in the DROP account. In such a case, the officer shall only be entitled
to receive the contributions, if any, made by the officer to the Borough's Police Pension Fund,
without interest.
Cost of Management for DROP Program. The Police Association and the Borough agree that any
costs or fees associated with the management of the DROP accounts shall be paid directly from
the Police Pension Fund and not by the Borough.
Amendment. Any amendments to this DROP enclosure shall be consistent with the provisions
covering deferred retirement option plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining
agreement and shall be binding upon all future DROP participants and upon all DROP participants
who have balances in their deferred retirement option accounts. The DROP plan may only be
amended by a written instrument, not by any oral agreement or past practice.
Effective Date. The effective date of this agreement is January 1, 2018; however, the
implementation of the DROP program will be provided as in this section.
Construal of Provisions. An officer's election to participate in the DROP program shall in no way
be construed as a limitation on the Borough's right to suspend or terminate an officer or to grant
the officer an honorable discharge based upon a physical or mental inability to perform his or her
duties. To the extent this section is inconsistent with any other section of Chapter 1, this section
shall control.
Severability.
The provisions of this section shall be severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held to
be unconstitutional or illegal, the validity of any of the remaining provisions of the section shall
not be affected thereby. It is hereby expressly declared as the intent of the Borough Council
that this section would have been adopted had such unconstitutional or illegal provision or
provisions not been included herein.
In the event that the DROP provision is declared invalid or illegal by a court of competent
jurisdiction or through an administrative determination of the Office of the Auditor General, the
Police Association shall have the right to bargain in accordance with Act 111 over deletion of
this benefit. It is expressly understood that this shall not involve bargaining over a
replacement provision.

Violations of any existing ordinance of the Borough of Akron or laws or regulations of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or laws or regulations of the United States of America which
results in a disturbance of the quiet use and enjoyment of neighboring properties and/or the
public and is a nuisance in fact.
§ 6-404. Nuisance Properties Prohibited.
[Ord. No. 00098, 8/12/2019]
Except as otherwise provided in this Part, it shall be unlawful for any person, property owner or
person responsible, to maintain, operate or use a nuisance property after the property has been
designated a nuisance property as provided for in this Part.
The Borough Manager shall first determine that a nuisance in fact exists or existed (as the case
may be). In so doing, the Borough Manager shall affirmatively establish that such a nuisance in
fact exists as is described in the definition of "nuisance" hereinbefore, including, but not limited to,
where there is an infringement on public safety that is common to the neighborhood or where it is
committed as well against those in the public who may be traveling in the vicinity. Examples only
are criminal conduct on the property or curtilage or nearby streets or sidewalks or the use of loud
and indecent language on the property or curtilage or on the public streets or sidewalks nearby
with great noise and clamor sufficient to annoy or alarm neighbors and the public.
When the Manager determines that the owner(s), person(s) responsible, tenant(s) or occupant(s)
of a property, or any person(s) present at a property with the permission and knowledge of the
owner(s), person(s) responsible, tenant(s) or occupant(s), has been found guilty or has pleaded
guilty to any nuisance activity (following the conviction for a citation or summons or arrest
occurring on the property) or a determination that there is a nuisance in fact on three separate
occasions within any one-year period and no related appeals are pending, the Manager may
declare the property to be a nuisance property and proceed with the notice and enforcement
procedures set forth in this Part.
For all properties, including rental properties, containing two or more dwelling units, each
individual unit shall be considered a "separate property" for purposes of enforcement of this Part,
thus requiring that three separate citations, summonses and/or arrests for nuisance activity must
be made involving the same dwelling unit in order to declare the individual unit a nuisance
property. Any occurrence of nuisance activity in the common area or others covered by the
definition of "property" shall be charged to the specific rental unit that the actor occupies or where
the actor is an invitee or guest, and not the property in whole.
If, after a property has been declared a nuisance property and no nuisance activities have
occurred for a period of 12 consecutive months from the date of the notice of the declaration of the
property as a nuisance property, the property will no longer be classified as a nuisance property.
Any criminal conviction or other nuisance activity perpetrated by a tenant who is already in the
process of being evicted shall not count towards the declaration of a nuisance property pursuant
to Subsection 2 above, provided that the property owner can prove that an eviction action has
been commenced in a court of law and that the property owner is actively prosecuting said
eviction action against the tenant.
An offense shall not be considered a nuisance activity if it is committed by a person having no
association with the property by acquaintance with, relation to or expressed or implied invitation
from the owner, occupant, operator or agent of the property.

Declaration.
[Ord. No. 00098, 8/12/2019]
The Manager shall provide written notice to the occupant of any property at which there has been
a nuisance activity. A separate notice shall be provided to the property owner for each nuisance
activity occurring on a property.
The notice shall contain the following information:
The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property;
A description of the nuisance activity and the date on which the nuisance activity occurred;
A statement that the property is declared a nuisance property or, if the property has not yet
been declared a nuisance property, a statement of the number of nuisance activities or
nuisance activity which will result in such a declaration;
If the property has been declared a nuisance property, a statement that the occurrence of any
subsequent nuisance activity at this property within 12 months following the date of the notice
may result in the property owner being cited with a summary violation and charged with the
costs incurred by the Borough to abate nuisance activity;
If the property has been declared a nuisance property, a statement that the occurrence of any
subsequent nuisance activity at this property within six months following the date of the notice
may result in the suspension or revocation of the use and occupancy under Chapter 27 of the
Borough of Akron Code of Ordinances.
Notice of property owner's right to appeal pursuant to § 6-407 of this Part and to obtain, upon
written request for such, copies of all documentation supporting the Manager's determination
that nuisance activity has occurred at the property; and
A statement that the property owner shall, within 15 business days of the date of the notice,
respond to the Manager in writing, either:
Appealing the finding of the Manager, or his/her designee; or
Providing a proposal detailing a course of action by which nuisance activities will be
abated at the property.
§ 6-406. Abatement of Nuisance Activity or Condition.
[Ord. No. 00098, 8/12/2019]
Within 15 business days of service of the notice of a nuisance property, the property owner may
submit in writing a plan to the Borough Manager by which the property owner proposes to prevent
further nuisance activities from occurring at the property. The time period for implementation of
any proposed plan shall not exceed 60 days from the date of plan submission approval or such
greater time period as may be extended for good cause by the Borough Manager. The Borough
Manager shall, within 15 business days of receipt of said proposal, either approve or disapprove of
the proposal and provide the property owner with written notice of his/her decision. The denial of a
plan by the Manager may be appealed by the property owner pursuant to § 6-407 of this Part.
If the Manager determines that any subsequent nuisance activity occurred within 12 months after
a property was declared a nuisance property, and the property owner failed to file either an appeal

of the declaration pursuant to § 6-407 of this Part or an approved plan to abate the nuisance
property pursuant to Subsection 1 above, the property owner may be assessed all costs incurred
by the Borough to abate the subsequent nuisance activity. Within 30 days of the Borough incurring
any costs set forth in this subsection, the Manager shall present the property owner with a written
demand for payment containing a description/summary of all costs incurred by the Borough and a
notice that the property owner has the right to appeal the demand pursuant to § 6-407 of this Part.
The written demand shall be delivered to the property owner in accordance with § 6-405 of this
Part. Failure to pay any such costs of abatement to the property shall be cause for the Borough to
file either or both an in rem judgment against the property or an in personam (personal) action
against the property owner(s) for recovery of the costs incurred by the Borough.
Costs of abatement shall be determined based on the time required to abate the nuisance activity
multiplied by an hourly rate based upon the wages and benefits of the employee, vehicle and
equipment costs, supervisory and administrative costs, and those of any contractors employed by
the Borough to abate the nuisance activity. The hourly rate may be adjusted based on the number
of employees and contractors required to abate the nuisance activity and shall be calculated by
the Borough Manager, and shall include, but not be limited to, actual costs and/or actual expenses
incurred to abate the infraction and associated property inspections. No such costs shall be
assessed for any public safety services. The failure to pay any cost imposed upon the property
owner shall constitute a lien against the property and may be enforced and/or collected as
provided by law.
In the case of professionals engaged by the Borough to provide services pursuant to the terms of
this Part, the regular fees and costs incurred by the Borough of those professionals providing
services pursuant to this Part shall also be recovered as herein set forth.
The Borough shall not assess any costs of abatement unless/until a final determination has been
made by the Board of Appeals pursuant to the provisions of this Part or a court of competent
jurisdiction on any appeal filed by the property owner pursuant to § 6-407 of this Part or the
property owner has failed to successfully implement a plan approved by the Manager pursuant to
Subsection 1 above. Following the aforesaid, costs of abatement may be assessed retroactively to
the beginning of action by the Borough.
The Borough may alternatively or concurrently take one or more of the following options as to
recovery of the aforesaid:
Institute suit before the Magisterial District Judge for the recovery of all such costs of
abatement, together with the filing fees and costs of recovery, including reasonable attorney's
fees and costs before the Magisterial District Judge.
Institute suit before the Court of Common Pleas for the recovery of all such costs of
abatement, together with the filing fees and costs of recovery, including reasonable attorney's
fees and costs before the Court of Common Pleas.
Undertake to file a lien against the property for said recovery pursuant to applicable laws
associated with recovery of liens against property owners, together with reasonable attorney's
fees and costs.
§ 6-407. Appeal.
[Ord. No. 00098, 8/12/2019]
Any property owner or other person aggrieved by a notice of a nuisance activity at his/her
property, a notice declaring his/her property a nuisance property, or a notice demanding payment
for costs of abatement of a nuisance activity at a nuisance property may, within 15 business days
of the service date of the notice, appeal the violation to the Board of Appeals pursuant to the
provisions of this Part. The fee for such appeal shall be set, from time to time, by resolution of

Council. The Board of Appeals shall conduct a hearing and render a decision in accordance with
the provisions of this Part and such other Borough ordinances, laws and regulations as may
govern its conduct and procedures.
The owner may prevail on appeal of any notice, if the owner demonstrates that:
He/she was not the owner of the property at the time of any of the nuisance activity that was
the basis of the notice;
He/she had knowledge of the nuisance activity but promptly, within the confines of existing
laws and regulations governing landlord actions, vigorously took all actions necessary to
prevent the occurrence of future nuisance activity; or
He/she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not, with reasonable care and
diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and upon receipt of the notice of the
declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he/she promptly, within the confines of
existing laws and regulations governing landlord actions, took all actions necessary to prevent
an existing nuisance activity or condition or the occurrence of a future nuisance activity or
condition.
Upon appeal of a notice declaring his/her property a nuisance property or a notice demanding
payment for costs of abatement of a nuisance activity at a nuisance property, if a property owner is
able to demonstrate to the Board that an eviction action has been commenced in a court of law
and that the property owner is actively prosecuting said eviction action against the offending
tenant within the confines of existing laws and regulations governing landlord actions, then the
Board of Appeals shall order a stay of any/all further enforcement of this Part by the Borough
pending a determination by the Magisterial District Judge or Lancaster County Court of Common
Pleas on the eviction action. If the property owner is successful in the eviction action, then the
property will no longer be classified as a nuisance property.
Upon appeal of a notice declaring his/her property a nuisance property or a notice demanding
payment for costs of abatement of a nuisance activity at a nuisance property, if a property owner is
able to demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that one or more of the nuisance activities which was
the basis of the declaration of nuisance property is subject to a "not guilty" decision relating to the
offending party, then the Board of Appeals shall order a stay of any/all further enforcement of this
Part by the Borough pending a determination by the Magisterial District Judge or Lancaster
County Court of Common Pleas on the citation or summons. If the offending party is found to be
"not guilty" on one or more of the citations or summonses, then the "not guilty" event or events
shall not count toward the declaration of the property as a nuisance property. No occurrence shall
be considered a violation as hereinabove set forth where such occurrence was included in an
accelerated rehabilitative disposition pursuant to the provisions of Pa.R.Crim.P. § 300 et seq., and
the defendant has completed all conditions of that disposition.
§ 6-408. Violations and Penalties.

fully abated as determined by the Borough Manager.
Where suit is brought by the Borough for the abatement of the nuisance activity or for the recovery

imposed for any other criminal offense arising from the same conduct, except for provisions of the
Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A., § 6504, relating to public nuisances.

Waiving anything desirable to waive that is prohibited or regulated by this Part.
Applications for Permits.
Any person or association of persons desiring to obtain a permit shall make written request at
the office of the Borough in person.
When a fee is required, permits will not be issued, nor will any activity be reserved until
payment is received. The Borough may make periodic or monthly payment arrangements with
groups requiring additional services, with ballfield leagues, and with other groups, where a
single payment is not practical for proper accounting procedures established by the Borough.
Fees may be established, from time to time, by resolution of Council.
Permits are issued on a first-come, first-served basis; however, priority shall be given to the
activities of the Borough residents. Requests for permits can be made for any dates, up to no
more than one year in advance.
No person under the age of 18 years shall be issued a permit.
Guidelines for Issuance of Permits.
Chairperson of the Parks Committee, Borough Manager or designated representative may
issue a permit hereunder when it is satisfied that:
The proposed use will not unreasonably interfere with or detract from the general public
use and enjoyment of any park.
The proposed use does not present a substantial or unwarranted safety hazard.
The facilities desired have not been already reserved.
The proposed use will not cause damage or injury to property.
The Borough shall take the following additional considerations into account in considering
permit requests to fairly determine as to whether a permit should be issued hereunder and
may require the requester to complete a special event application to aid in its determination.
The size and purpose for which the park is normally used.
The location of the park and the area surrounding it.
The facilities available to accommodate the intended use.
Any person or association of persons denied the issuance of a permit or a fee waiver may
appeal to the Council of Akron Borough in writing within 10 business days of being notified of
said denial.
The appeal will be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Borough Council
occurring more than 15 days after receipt of the appeal.

Part 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 17-101. Short Title.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-101]
This chapter shall be enacted as a substitute for current Chapter 17 of the Borough of Akron Code of
Ordinances and may hereinafter be known and may be cited as the "Akron Borough Stormwater
Management Ordinance" ("SWMO").
§ 17-102. Statement of Findings.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-102]
Council of the Borough of Akron finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management ("SWM"), including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the
public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the Municipality and all the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.

Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of
stormwater controls. Akron Borough is required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges
from its municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
Riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering pollutants in runoff, providing light
control and temperature moderation, processing pollutants, increasing infiltration and
providing channel and shoreline stability thus decreasing erosion.
§ 17-103. Purpose.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-103]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare by minimizing the harm and
maximizing the benefits described in § 17-102 of this chapter through provisions designed to:
Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code,
Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the
waters of this commonwealth.
Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as practicable.
Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality
and to otherwise protect water resources.
Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater management best management
practices (SWM BMPs) that are implemented within the Borough.
Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
Promote stormwater runoff prevention through the use of nonstructural best management
practices (BMPs).
Provide a regulatory environment that supports the proportion, density and intensity of
development called for in the Borough's Comprehensive Plan; allow for creative methods of
improving water quality and managing stormwater runoff; and promote a regional approach to
water resource management.
Help preserve and protect exceptional natural resources, and conserve and restore natural
resource systems.
Promote stormwater management practices that emphasize infiltration, evaporation, and
transpiration.

For all regulated activities, erosion and sediment control and stormwater management BMPs shall
be designed, implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and requirements of
this chapter and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean
Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual (E&S Manual),[1] No. 363-2134-008 (March 2012), as amended
and updated, and the BMP Manual.
Editor's Note: See Part 10, Reference 9.
Developers have the option to propose a Regional Stormwater Management Plan or participate in
a Regional Stormwater Management Plan developed by others. A Regional Stormwater
Management Plan may include off-site volume and rate control, as appropriate and supported by a
detailed design approved by the Municipality in accordance with Subsection 4. A Regional
Stormwater Management Plan must meet all of the volume and rate control standards required by
this chapter for the area defined by the Regional Stormwater Management Plan, but not
necessarily for each individual development site. Appropriate agreements must be established to
ensure the requirements of this chapter and the requirements of the Regional Stormwater
Management Plan are met.
Unless prohibited by Akron Borough.
Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] or any ordinance which regulates construction and development
within the areas of the Borough subject to flooding, and any other applicable requirements of the
Floodplain Management Act, stormwater management facilities located in the floodplain are
permitted when designed and constructed in accordance with the more strict provisions of Chapter
27 of the Akron Borough Code of Ordinances and the BMP Manual, regulatory requirements and
the requirements of this chapter.
Impervious Areas.
The measurement of impervious area shall include all of the impervious areas in the total
proposed development even if development is to take place in stages or phases.
For development taking place in stages or phases, the entire development plan must be used
in determining conformance with this chapter.
Any areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be impervious.
All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
Protect health, safety, and property.
Meet the water quality goals of this chapter by implementing measures to:
Protect and/or improve the function of floodplains, wetlands, and wooded areas.
Protect and/or improve native plant communities including those within the riparian
corridor.
Protect and/or improve natural drainageways from erosion.
Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this commonwealth.
Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious areas, wherever possible.
The design of all stormwater management facilities over karst shall include an evaluation of
measures to minimize adverse effects.
Infiltration BMPs shall be spread out, made as shallow as practicable, and located to maximize
use of natural on-site infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.

Infiltration BMPs shall include pretreatment BMPs unless shown to be unnecessary.
Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected based on
suitability of soils and development site conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the facility and the limiting zone, unless
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Borough that the selected BMP has design criteria
which allow for a smaller separation.
A stabilized infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater load and drain
completely as determined by field tests conducted by the applicant's professional designer.
The stabilized infiltration rate is to be determined in the same location and within the
same soil horizon as the bottom of the infiltration facility.
The stabilized infiltration rate is to be determined as specified in the BMP Manual.
The calculation methodology to be used in the analysis of volume and peak rates of discharge
shall be as required in § 17-305.
A planting plan is required for all vegetated stormwater BMPs.
Native or naturalized/noninvasive vegetation suitable to the soil and hydrologic conditions of
the development site shall be used unless otherwise specified in the BMP Manual.
Invasive vegetation may not be included in any planting schedule. [See invasive plants in
Pennsylvania by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR).]
The limit of existing, native vegetation to remain shall be delineated on the plan along with
proposed construction protection measures.
Prior to construction, a tree protection zone shall be delineated at the dripline of the tree
canopy. All trees scheduled to remain during construction shall be marked; however, where
groups of trees exist, only the trees on the outside edge need to be marked. A forty-eight-inch
high snow fence or forty-eight-inch high construction fence mounted on steel posts located
eight feet on center shall be placed along the tree protection boundary. No construction,
storage of material, temporary parking, pollution of soil, or regrading shall occur within the
tree protection zone.
All planting shall be performed in conformance with good nursery and landscape practice.
Plant materials shall conform to the standards recommended by the American Association of
Nurseryman, Inc., in the American Standard of Nursery Stock.
Planting designs are encouraged to share planting space for optimal root growth
whenever possible.
No staking or wiring of trees shall be allowed without a maintenance note for the stake
and/or wire removal within one year of planting.
Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and compaction during
the construction phase to maintain maximum infiltration capacity. Staging of earthmoving activities
and selection of construction equipment should consider this protection.
Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff from disturbed areas until the entire
contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has achieved final stabilization.
A minimum ten-foot wide access easement shall be provided for all stormwater facilities with
tributary areas equal or greater than 1,000 square feet and not located within a public right-of-way.

Drainage easements shall be provided where the conveyance, treatment, or storage of
stormwater, either existing or proposed, is identified on the SWM site plan. Drainage easements
shall be provided to contain and convey the one-hundred-year frequency flood.
The Borough may require additional stormwater control measures for stormwater discharges to
special management areas including, but not limited to:
Water bodies listed as "impaired" on Pennsylvania's Clean Water Act 303(d/305(b))
Integrated List.
Any water body or watershed with an approved total maximum daily load (TMDL).
Critical areas with sensitive resources (e.g., state designated special protection waters, cold
water fisheries, carbonate or other groundwater recharge areas highly vulnerable to
contamination, drainage areas to water supply reservoirs, source water protection zones, etc.)
Roof drains and sump pumps shall be tributary to infiltration or vegetative BMPs. Use of
catchment facilities for the purpose of reuse is also permitted.
Nonstructural BMPs shall be utilized for all regulated activities unless proven to be impractical.
§ 17-302. Volume Controls.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-302]
Volume control BMPs are intended to maintain existing hydrologic conditions for small storm
events by promoting groundwater recharge and/or evapotranspiration as described in this section.
Runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method described in
paragraph .A below, or through continuous modeling approaches or other means as described in
the BMP Manual. Small projects may use the method described in paragraph .B to design volume
control BMPs.
The design storm method is applicable to any size of regulated activity. This method requires
detailed modeling based on site conditions.
Do not increase the post development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less
than the two-year twenty-four-hour storm event.
For modeling purposes:
Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow
in good condition.
When the existing project site contains impervious area, 20% of existing impervious
area to be disturbed shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.
The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in Karst areas shall be 3:1
impervious drainage area to infiltration area and 5:1 total drainage area to infiltration
area. The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in non-Karst areas shall
be 5:1 impervious drainage area to infiltration area and 8:1 total drainage area to
infiltration area. A higher ratio may be approved by the Borough if justification is
provided. Hydraulic depth may be used as an alternative to an area based loading
ratio if the design hydraulic depth is shown to be less than the depth that could result
from the maximum area loading ratio.

Volume Control for Small Projects.
At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces or an equivalent volume
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow  i.e., it shall not be released into the
surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration and infiltration.
A detailed geologic evaluation of the development site shall be performed in areas of
carbonate geology to determine the design parameters of recharge facilities. A report shall be
prepared in accordance with § 17-405, Subsection 1, of this Borough.
Storage facilities, including normally dry, open top facilities, shall completely drain the volume
control storage over a period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from
the end of the design storm. Any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt from the
minimum twenty-four-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter period of time, provided
that none of this water will be discharged into waters of this commonwealth.
Any portion of the volume control storage that meets the following criteria may also be used
as rate control storage:
Volume control storage that depends on infiltration is designed according to the infiltration
standards in § 17-301.
The volume control storage which will be used for rate control is that storage which is
available within 24 hours from the end of the design storm based on the stabilized
infiltration rate and/or the evapotranspiration rate.
Volume control storage facilities designed to infiltrate shall avoid the least permeable
hydrologic soil group(s) at the development site.
§ 17-303. Rate Controls.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-303]
Rate control for large storms, up to the one-hundred-year event, is essential to protect against
immediate downstream erosion and flooding.
Match Pre-development Hydrograph. Applicants shall provide infiltration facilities or utilize
other techniques which will allow the post-development one-hundred-year hydrograph to
match the pre-development one-hundred-year hydrograph, along all parts of the hydrograph,
for the development site. To match the pre-development hydrograph, the post development
peak rate must be less than or equal to the pre-development peak rate, and the post
development runoff volume must be less than or equal to the pre-development volume for the
same storm event. A shift in hydrograph peak time of up to five minutes and a rate variation of
up to 5% at a given time may be allowable to account for the timing affect of BMPs used to
manage the peak rate and runoff volume. "Volume control" volumes as given in § 17-302
above may be used as part of this option.
Where the pre-development hydrograph cannot be matched, one of the following shall apply:
For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Plan:
Post development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates
for the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm
events.* If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post
development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by
the predevelopment analysis for two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour storms,* then the requirements of this section have been met.

Table 17-3-1 in § 17-305.
For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Plan:
For the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm events,* the post
development peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps.
* A twenty-four-hour SCS type II storm or an IDF curve rational method storm. See
Table 17-3-1 in § 17-305.
Normally dry, open top, storage facilities shall completely drain the rate control storage over a
period of time less than or equal to 24 hours from the peak one-hundred-year water surface
design elevation.
A variety of BMPs should be employed and tailored to suit the development site. The
following is a partial listing of BMPs which can be utilized in SWM systems for rate control
where appropriate:
Decreased impervious surface coverage.
Routed flow over grass.
Grassed channels and vegetated strips.
Bioretention areas (rain gardens).
Concrete lattice block or permeable surfaces.
Seepage pits, seepage trenches or other infiltration structures.
Rooftop detention.
Parking lot detention.
Cisterns and underground reservoirs.
Amended soils.
Retention basins.
Detention basins.
Other methods as may be found in the BMP Manual.
Small projects are not required to provide for rate control.
§ 17-304. Stormwater Management Performance Standards.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-304]
Runoff from impervious areas shall be drained to pervious areas within the development site,
unless the site has 85% or more impervious cover and is a redevelopment,[1] in which case the
portion of the site that discharges to pervious areas shall be maximized.

Editor's Note: See Part 10, Reference 10.
Stormwater runoff from a development site to an adjacent property shall flow directly into a natural
drainageway, watercourse, or into an existing storm sewer system, or onto adjacent properties in a
manner similar to the runoff characteristics of the pre-development flow.
Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created, increased, decreased, relocated, or
otherwise altered without written notification of the adjacent property owner(s) by the developer.
Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this Borough, including the
establishment of a drainage easement. Copies of all such notifications shall be included in SWM
site plan submissions.
Existing on-site natural and man-made SWM facilities shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable.
Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one sub-watershed to another unless they are
sub-watersheds of a common watershed that join together within the perimeter of the development
site and the effect of the transfer does not alter the peak discharge onto adjacent lands.
Minimum floor elevations for all structures that would be affected by a basin, other temporary
impoundments, or open conveyance systems where pending may occur shall be two feet above
the one-hundred-year water surface elevation. If basement or underground facilities are proposed,
detailed calculations addressing the effects of stormwater ponding on the structure and waterproofing
and/or flood-proofing design information shall be submitted for approval.
All stormwater conveyance facilities (excluding detention, retention, and wetland basin outfall
structures) shall be designed to convey a twenty-five-year storm event.* All stormwater
conveyance facilities (excluding detention, retention, and wetland basin outfall structures)
conveying water originating from off site shall be designed to convey a fifty-year storm event.*
Safe conveyance of the one-hundred-year runoff event* to appropriate peak rate control BMPs
must be demonstrated in the design.
* A twenty-four-hour SCS Type II storm or an IDF curve rational method storm.
Erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels, and at all points of discharge. Flow
velocities from any storm sewer may not result in erosion of the receiving channel.
§ 17-305. Calculation Methodology.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-305]
Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater than 200 acres and time of
concentration (T ) greater than 60 minutes, including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally
accepted calculation techniques based on the NRCS soil-cover complex method.
Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the modified rational
method, a soil-cover-complex methodology, or other method acceptable to the Borough. Table 17-
3-1 summarizes acceptable computation methods. It is assumed that all methods will be selected
by the design professional based on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a
particular development site.

If the SCS method is used, Antecedent Moisture Condition 1 is to be used in areas of carbonate
geology, and Antecedent Moisture Condition 2 is to be used in all other areas. A type II distribution
shall be used in all areas.
If the rational method is used, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas
14 data (see Subsection 2 above) or PennDOT Publication 584 "PennDOT Drainage Manual,"
2008 Edition, or latest, shall be used to determine the rainfall intensity in inches per hour based on
the information for the five through 60 minute duration storm events.
Hydrographs may be obtained from NRCS methods such as TR-55, TR-20, or from use of the
"modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational methods. If "modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational
methods are used, the ascending leg of the hydrograph shall have a length equal to three times
the time of concentration (3xT ) and the descending leg shall have a length equal to seven times
the time of concentration (7xT ) to approximate an SCS Type II hydrograph.[1]
Editor's Note: See Part 10, Reference 11.
Runoff calculations shall include a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis indicating volume and
velocities of flow and the grades, sizes, and capacities of water carrying structures, sediment
basins, retention and detention structures and sufficient design information to construct such
facilities. Runoff calculations shall also indicate both predevelopment and post-development rates
for peak discharge of stormwater runoff from all discharge points.
For the purpose of calculating pre-development peak discharges, all runoff coefficients, both onsite
and off-site, shall be based on actual land use assuming summer or good land conditions.
Post-development runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to design conveyance facilities
shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land conditions.
Criteria and assumptions to be used in the determination of stormwater runoff and design of
management facilities are as follows:
Runoff coefficients shall be based on the information contained in Appendix 17-B-1 and 17-B-

these appendices, runoff coefficients shall be chosen from other published documentation,
and a copy of said documentation shall be submitted with the SWM site plan.
A sample worksheet for calculating T is provided in Appendix 17-B-4. Times of concentration
(T ) shall be based on the following design parameters:
Sheet Flow. The maximum length for each reach of sheet or overland flow before shallow
concentrated or open channel flow develops is 150 feet. Flow lengths greater than 100
feet shall be justified based on the actual conditions at each development site. Sheet flow
may be determined using the nomograph in Appendix 17-B-3, or the Manning's kinematic
solution shown in the sheet flow section of Worksheet No. 1 in Appendix 17-B-4.
Shallow Concentrated Flow. Travel time for shallow concentrated flow shall be
determined using Figure 3-1 from TR-55, Urban Hydrology for small watersheds, as
shown in Appendix 17-B-5.
Open Channel Flows. At points where sheet and shallow concentrated flows concentrate
in field depressions, swales, gutters, curbs, or pipe collection systems, the travel times to
downstream end of the development site between these design points shall be based
upon Manning's equation and/or acceptable engineering design standards as determined
by the Municipal Engineer.
The developer may use stormwater credits for nonstructural BMPs in accordance with the
BMP Manual. The allowable reduction will be determined by the Borough.
Peak rate control is not required for off-site runoff. Off-site runoff may be by-passed around
the site provided all other discharge requirements are met. If off-site runoff is routed through
rate control facilities, runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to design those rate
control facilities shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land conditions.
Times of concentration shall be calculated based on the methodology recommended in the
respective model used. Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's equation. Supporting documentation and calculations must be submitted for review and
approval.
§ 17-306. Riparian Corridors.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-306]
In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian corridor easement shall be created and
recorded as part of any subdivision or land development that encompasses a riparian corridor.
Except as otherwise required by Chapter 102, the riparian corridor easement shall be measured to
be the greater of the limit of the one-hundred-year floodplain or 35 feet from the top of streambank
(on each side).
Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Corridors.
Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within the riparian corridor
easement.
Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively removed and the riparian corridor
easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse
native plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.
The riparian corridor easement shall be enforceable by the Borough and shall be recorded in the
Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the

resolution. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall count toward
the minimum lot area as required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in Chapter 27 of the
Borough of Akron Code of Ordinances.
Any permitted use within the riparian corridor easement shall be conducted in a manner that will
maintain the extent of the existing one-hundred-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream
stability, and preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private recreation trails are permitted
within riparian corridors:
Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant species and other sensitive
environmental features.
Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted within the riparian corridor
easement and shall comply with setback requirements established under 25 Pa Code, Chapter 73.

[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-604]
The Borough reserves the right to accept or reject any proposal to dedicate ownership and
operating responsibility of any SWM facilities to the Borough.
If SWM facilities are accepted by the Borough for dedication, the land-owner/developer shall be
required to pay a specified amount to the municipal stormwater maintenance fund to defray costs
of periodic inspections and maintenance expenses. This fee shall be provided to the Borough prior
to unconditional plan approval. The amount of the deposit shall be determined as follows subject
to the approval of the municipal governing body:
The deposit shall cover the estimated costs for maintenance and inspections for 25 years.

§ 17-605. Maintenance of Existing Facilities/BMPs.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-605]
SWM facilities existing on the effective date of this chapter, which have not been accepted by the
Borough or for which maintenance responsibility has not been assumed by a private entity such as a
homeowners' association shall be maintained by the individual landowners. Such maintenance shall
include at a minimum those items set forth in Subsection 2A above. If the Borough determines at any
time that any permanent SWM facility has been eliminated, altered, blocked through the erection of
structures or the deposit of materials, or improperly maintained, the condition constitutes a nuisance
and the Borough shall notify the landowner of corrective measures that are required, and provide for a
reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, within which the property owner shall take such
corrective action. If the landowner does not take the required corrective action, the Borough may either
perform the work or contract for the performance of the work and bill the landowner for the cost of the
work plus a penalty of 10% of the cost of the work. If such bill is not paid by the property owner within
30 days, the Borough may file a municipal claim against the property upon which the work was
performed in accordance with the applicable laws. The Borough shall have the right to choose among
the remedies and may use one or more remedies concurrently.
§ 17-606. Akron Borough Stormwater Maintenance Fund.
[Ord. 00075, 4/14/2014, § 17-606]
Persons (other than the Borough) installing stormwater storage facilities shall be required to pay a
specified amount to the Akron Borough Stormwater Maintenance Fund to help defray costs of
periodic inspections and administrative expenses.
The amount of the deposit shall be determined as follows:
If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained, the deposit shall cover the cost
of periodic inspections performed by the Borough, for a period of 10 years.
If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the Borough, the deposit shall cover
the cost of periodic inspections performed by the Borough and for maintenance costs, for a
period of 10 years.
Borough Engineer's initial estimate shall be based upon a reasonable estimate to inspect the
stormwater facilities on each property four times. Those four times include the completion of
work, three years later, six years later, and nine years after completion. The calculation
includes a 3% increase each year to address salary costs increases. The formula is as
follows:

The Borough's Engineer will establish the estimated costs utilizing information submitted by
the applicant. If the applicant is not satisfied with costs prepared by the Borough Engineer,
applicant may appeal the same pursuant to the Local Agency Law.
If at some future time a storage facility (whether publicly or privately owned) is eliminated due to
the installation of storm sewers or other storage facility the unused portion of the maintenance
fund deposit will be applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to the storm
sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the deposit remaining after the costs of
abandonment are paid will be returned to the depositor.
No interest shall be earned on any deposits by any person and all interest shall become the
property of the Borough to be further used for inspection, maintenance and correction of privately
and publicly owned stormwater storage facilities.
Nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of any duty of any private owner to maintain its

In each case of commercial or industrial users, the total tapping fee shall be modified by
adding a capacity fee and collection fee parts sum computed by multiplying the sums set forth
in the capacity fee and collection fee parts times the number of equivalent dwelling units
estimated, in good faith, by the applicant to be the applicant's average daily usage over the
term of the first five years of use, but will never be less than one capacity fee and collection
fee part.
In the event that the Borough is not satisfied with applicant's estimate, the Borough's

believed that sewage usage has changed from that previously approved and previously
assessed. Owner will promptly pay to the Borough the corrected capacity fee and collection
fee parts then in effect times the number of increased equivalent dwelling units actually used
or anticipated to be used. Any overpayments hereunder shall be considered for reservation of
capacity and costs in processing and shall not be refunded. Capacity fee and collection fee
components shall be used for increased usages of equivalent dwelling units of sewage
capacity and shall be charged at the capacity fee and collection fee components then in

separate unit and a separate capacity fee and collection fee parts shall be paid thereafter,
except when a business or professional use is in connection with a dwelling unit occupied by
the same person who owns and operates the business or profession (and no persons are
employed therein). This provision shall apply to tapping fees only. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit, if otherwise authorized (and if all applicable monies are paid), single
laterals for multiple units under one ownership.
All fees shall be due and payable at the time application is made to the Borough to make any
such connection to the sewer system or upon the date when the Borough shall connect any

"facilities") and these provisions assist both Boroughs in complying with all applicable state
and federal laws including but not limited to the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et
seq.,) and the Federal General Pretreatment Regulation (40 CFR 403). The objectives of
these provision are:
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the facilities which will interfere with the
operation of the facilities or contaminate the resulting biosolids.
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the facilities that will pass through the
facilities, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be
incompatible with the facilities.
To help protect personnel who work at the facilities and to help protect the public from
unnecessary biological or chemical hazards.
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and biosolids from the
facilities.
To provide for fees for equitable distribution of the cost of operation of the facilities.
To enable the Borough of Ephrata to comply with its National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System Permit condition, biosolids use and disposal requirements, and for
the Borough of Ephrata and the Borough of Akron to comply with any other federal or
state laws to which the facilities are subject.
To provide a database for future facilities designs and operation work.
These regulations define certain terms and provide for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the facilities through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users.
Through enforcement of general requirements for the other users.
Authorizes monitoring, inspection, and enforcement activities.
Requires user testing and reporting.
Provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
treatment of nondomestic wastewater and of the costs resulting from the program
established herein.
These regulations and fees shall apply to the users located in the Borough of Akron or
serviced by the Borough of Akron and to all users who are, by contract or agreement, users of
the facilities, whether or not they are located in the Borough of Akron.
These regulations establish fines and penalties for noncompliance with the regulations and
further establish additional provisions for corrective action in cases of such noncompliance.

National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, are hereby incorporated.
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or
the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Borough of Ephrata and or the Borough of
Akron (or the Administrator) may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standards is mixed with wastewater
not regulated by the same standard, the Borough of Ephrata or the Borough of Akron (or the
Administrator) shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
A user may obtain an EPA variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial
user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that
factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by
EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40
CFR 403.15.
Local Limits.
Local limits on the concentration of special pollutants are hereby established on all industrial
users as listed in Table 1 in this section. These limits are established in accordance with 40
CFR 403.5(C).
The Borough of Akron (or the Administrator) and the Borough of Ephrata reserve the right to
establish alternate special pollutant discharge limitations in individual industrial waste
discharge permits, but only in accordance with regulatory requirements. At no time will the
summation of the industrial users' discharges be greater than the allowable industrial
headworks loading as defined in 40 CFR, Part 403. The specific pollutant discharge
limitations, if more stringent than the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard shall
immediately supersede that National Categorical Pretreatment Standard. To the extent that
any federal or state requirements and limitations on discharges are more stringent than the
local limits, the most stringent requirement and limitations shall apply.
The pollutant concentrations shall be measured in a representative sample collected at the
point of discharge of the industrial user to a public wastewater collection system. The
concentrations shall be based on a twenty-four-hour composite sample, except however, for
certain pollutants the industrial user may request and the Borough of Akron (or the
Administrator) and the Borough of Ephrata may allow that this concentration be determined
by analyses of grab sample. Certain pollutants such as temperature and grease must be
determined on the basis of a grab sample (see § 18-306, Subsection 10). Any sampling
criteria shall be described in the industrial waste discharge permit.

The waste contribution report shall be on a form provided by the Administrator and shall
indicate the nature and concentration of pollutants in the industrial waste effluent. The waste
characteristics shall be based on the results of analysis of the waste performed by a qualified
laboratory acceptable to the Administrator. Upon specific approval of the Administrator the
permittee may elect to employ in-house facilities for the analysis of certain parameters being
monitored. However, at least once per year, a split sample shall be analyzed for all
parameters being monitored in-house by both the in-house laboratory and a qualified
independent laboratory. The results of both laboratories shall then be submitted to the
Administrator for review. The Administrator reserves the right to deny and/or withdraw the
approval for the use of in-house facilities at any time.
This report shall also include the average daily flow for the reporting period.
At the discretion of the Administrator and in consideration of such factors as production
schedules, budget cycles, etc., the Administrator may agree to alter the months during which
the above reports are to be submitted.
Significant industrial users shall also be subject to the reporting requirements of § 18-306 of
this Part.
Sampling, Flow Measurement, Testing and Inspection.
All major industrial users and minor industrial users shall install at their expense a suitable
control manhole, (together with meters if required by the Boroughs as a condition of the
permit) and other appurtenances in the sewer to provide for inspection, sampling and
measurement of the waste.
The control manhole should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the
Administrator may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near the control manhole to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis.
The control manhole, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Construction of the
control manhole shall be completed within 90 days following the date of written notice by
the Administrator.
In the event that no control manhole has been constructed, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which
the building sewer is connected.
Users discharging industrial waste to the POTW shall provide the Administrator and its
representatives the opportunity of access at any time, upon reasonable notice, to any
improved property served by the wastewater system as shall be required for purposes of
inspection, measurement, sampling, testing and records examination to ascertain whether the
purpose of this Part is being met and all requirements are being complied with, and for
performance of other functions relating to service rendered by the Administrator. The
Administrator shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations.
All measurements, samplings, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes
to which reference is made in this Part shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical

techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in
accordance with procedures approved by E.P.A.
Twenty-four hour composite samples shall be considered the standard for all sampling
performed in accordance with the Part, except where grab samples are required in § 18-306,
Subsection 10, hereof. However, other appropriate sampling procedures may be acceptable
at the discretion of the Administrator, if previously approved and included as part of the permit
conditions.
The costs of all measurement, sampling, testing, inspection and other monitoring activities
incurred by the Administrator while enforcing the provisions of this Part shall be the sole
responsibility of and paid by the applicable industrial user. Such costs shall be additional
sewer user charges and shall be charged directly to the user using the same procedures for
billing and collection as used for the billing and collection of surcharges, as described in § 18-
305.
§ 18-305. Pretreatment Charges, Fees and Surcharges.
[Ord. 00042, 6/9/2008, § 305]
Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The Administrator may adopt from time to time, subject to review
and approval by Akron Borough Council, reasonable charges and fees which may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Administrator's pretreatment
program including, but not limited to, legal and engineering costs.
Fees for industrial waste discharge permit application.
Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; including the cost of collecting
and analyzing a user's discharge and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users.
Fees for filing appeals.
Fees for consistent removal by the Administrator of pollutants otherwise subject to Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Other fees as the Administrator may deem necessary to carry out the requirements of this
Part.
These fees relate solely to matters covered by this Part and are separate from other fees, fines
and penalties chargeable by the Administrator, the Borough of Akron or the Borough of Ephrata.
Surcharges.
Certain portions of the facilities have been designed to accommodate treatment of
wastewater BOD, suspended solids, Phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen. Certain costs of
operations of the facilities are incurred by Ephrata and/or Akron for the removal of BOD,
suspended solids, phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen from the wastewater flows. If all users
discharged wastewater with similar concentration of BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and
ammonia nitrogen, then the imposition of user rates on the flow basis would be fair and
equitable. Certain users of the facilities, however, discharge wastewater with concentrations
of BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen that are significantly greater
than average concentrations of these pollution parameters. Since Ephrata has provided
certain equipment and expends certain operating costs that are provided to accommodate the
treatment of BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen, it has determined
that those costs of equipment and operation should be allocated onto the users on a pro rata

basis for those users that discharge their waste with concentrations of BOD, suspended
solids, phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen that exceed the average wasteload concentrations.
This allocation is imposed by surcharges established by Ephrata. Because of the high cost of
analyzing BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen concentrations. These
surcharges will only be imposed upon users that generate large wastewater flows. These
Surcharges are imposed only on major and minor industrial users. (Discharges generated by
major industrial users and minor industrial users containing concentrations of BOD and/or
suspended solids in excess of 250 mg/l shall be subject to a surcharge factor. Discharges
generated by major industrial users and minor industrial users containing concentrations of
phosphorus in excess of 15 mg/l and/or ammonia nitrogen concentrations in excess of 50
mg/l shall be subject to a surcharge factor.) Surcharge factor shall be applied to the standard
user fee.
For the purposes of this section, the term "standard user fee" shall be that fee that
municipalities and/or municipal authorities pay to the Borough of Ephrata for the pro rata cost
of operation for Plant No. 1 and the pro rata payment of total annual capital cost as
established in accordance with the procedures described in the sewage service agreement.
The major industrial user and minor industrial user shall be charged their regular customer
charge for normal strength wastewater directly by the Borough of Akron. This charge must be
paid to the Borough of Akron in accordance with the Borough of Akron's ordinances. The
surcharges imposed by this Part are separate charges that will be charged directly by the
owner of the facilities, i.e., the Administrator, the Borough of Ephrata, or the Borough of
Akron, as the case may be, on the major industrial user and minor industrial user and this
separate charge will be payable directly to the Borough of Ephrata, the Administrator and/or
Borough of Akron as that use may be.
The surcharge factors shall be imposed on the user fees as described above in paragraph .B
herein, and not on the user fees charged by the collection system owner.
The surcharge factors shall be imposed on the user fees as described above in paragraph .B
herein, and not on any base minimum quarterly charge.
The surcharge factors shall be imposed on the user fees calculated on existing customer or
user flows and not projected on future flows and, therefore, no surcharge shall be imposed
upon any user reservation fee or tapping fee.
Surcharge factors shall be computed on the basis of the measured or estimated concentration
of pollutants for data as may be available to the Administrator. The basis for calculation of
these factors shall be average daily loading concentrations based upon thirty-day averages. If
the data is available based upon an analysis of daily testing of twenty-four-hour composite
samples, that data will be used to compute the surcharge factor. If less detailed data is
available, the Administrator shall use its discretion to select the loading concentration based
upon the best available information. This concentration data may, therefore, only be based
upon an analysis of periodic grab samples. If the industrial user objects to the loading
concentration used for the calculation of these factors the industrial user can provide the
Administrator with more complete test data.
The establishment of concentration loads for billing purposes shall be made no more
frequently than annually, unless otherwise established for major industrial users; as quarterly
as a condition of the Industrial Waste Discharge Permit. That is, the Borough of Ephrata,
Borough of Akron or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall establish the surcharge
factor annually (except as noted) and bill for the following year using that factor.
Surcharge Factor. For the major industrial user and/or minor industrial user whose discharge
has a total BOD concentration in excess of 250 mg/l and/or suspended solids concentration in
excess of 250 mg/l and/or phosphorus concentrations in excess of 15 mg/l and/or ammonia
nitrogen concentrations in excess of 50 mg/l, a surcharge factor will be applied to the

standard user fee to arrive at the industrial surcharge bill. This surcharge is imposed upon
major industrial users and minor industrial users to allow the pro rata normal costs incurred by
the Borough to provide the facilities and facility operation and maintenance for removal of
BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen when discharged into the POTW
in a concentration higher than the concentration of those components in sanitary wastewater.
The surcharge factor will be established by resolution of Ephrata.
Collection. Any and all charges, costs, fees, surcharges, expenses, etc shall be due and
collectible by the Borough of Akron or Administrator in the same manner as sewer charges are
due and collectible by the Borough of Akron.

Periodic Compliance Reports.
All major industrial users shall cause to be submitted to the Borough original monitoring
results from an independent laboratory at a frequency determined by the Borough but in no
case less than four times per year (by March, June, September and December). The
monitoring results shall indicate the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by pretreatment standards. The independent laboratory shall be of the
user's choice and approved by the Borough, and will conduct sampling without prior notice to
the user. Measured or estimated average and if required maximum daily flows for the
reporting period shall be obtained from the municipality and cause to be submitted to the
Borough quarterly. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management
practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required
by the Borough or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard at
least quarterly. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with § 18-306, Subsection 4, hereof.
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. Wastewater meters shall be calibrated at least
annually, water meters shall be calibrated at least once every 10 years. The failure of a user
to keep its monitoring facility(ies) in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to
claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Administrator, using the procedures prescribed in Subsection
11 of this Part, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the Borough of any planned changes to the
user's operations or system which might affect the potential for a slug discharge or has the
potential to alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the
change.
The Administrator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed
necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of an industrial waste
discharge Permit application under Subsection 2B of this Part.
The Administrator may issue an industrial waste discharge permit under § 18-304, Subsection
1F, of this Part or modify an existing industrial waste discharge permit under § 18-304,
Subsection 2B(1), of this Part in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
For purposes of this requirement, the term "changes" include, but are not limited to, flow
increases of 20% or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
Reports of Potential Problems.
In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of
a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may
cause potential problems for the POTW, a user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Administrator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the Administrator,
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor

shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed pursuant to this Part.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place
advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph .A,
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur,
are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain an industrial waste discharge
permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Administrator as the Administrator may require.
Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a
violation, the user must notify by telephone the Administrator within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the violation and shall provide written notice within five days. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Administrator within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the
Administrator monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the Administrator samples
between the user's initial sampling, and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of an Industrial waste discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
Sample Collection.
Except as indicated in paragraph .B, below, the industrial user must collect wastewater
samples using flow-proportional twenty-four-hour composite wastewater sample collection
techniques. The Borough may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a grab
sample where the industrial user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample
of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
Samples for fats, oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile
organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
Timing. Unless otherwise indicated, written reports shall be deemed to have been submitted on
the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of actual receipt of the report shall govern.
Record Keeping. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this section shall retain
and make available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained pursuant to any
monitoring activities or BMPs required by this article and any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities or BMPs undertaken by the industrial user independent
of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling
and the same of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. Also records necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable BMPs must be kept.
This may include records of pH or flow meter calibration. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the Borough, or applicable municipal owner of a collection system
used by the industrial user, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the Borough.

assurances or voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken
by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such
documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
Subsections 4 and 5 of this Part and shall be judicially enforceable. Issuance of a consent order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefore.
After the hearing board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user
responsible for the violation, directing that following a specific time period, the sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances have been installed and existing treatment facilities, devices
or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives

responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided by installing and properly
operating adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances, sewer service
may be discontinued. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend
the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.

action against the user.

violate, any provision of this Part, an industrial waste discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
recur, the Administrator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such

damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Akron
Borough and/or the Administrator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Borough that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in Subsection 8 of this Part are initiated against
the user.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Borough of
Akron and the Administrator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under

Conditions and Terms of Agreement. In the agreement:
The County agrees(a) to arrange for the provision of municipal waste disposal facilities
for the economical and environmentally sound disposal of municipal waste generated
within the participating municipalities, (b) to coordinate recycling activities and marketing
and (c) to assure continuing municipal waste planning for the County and all participating
municipalities by entering into an agreement with LCSWMA.
The County and the participating municipalities representing, in the aggregate, not less
than, 60% of the population of the County, each agree to enact a waste flow ordinance in
a form substantially similar to this Part and to assure otherwise that all acceptable
municipal waste be delivered to the County system.
The County agrees (a) to enact rules and regulations, (b) to cause LCSWMA to enact
additional rules and regulations and to administer a licensing program, and (c) to enforce
this Part and parallel municipal waste flow ordinances.
The County agrees to assure reasonable and uniform solid waste disposal fees for
residents of the participating municipalities.
The parties agree to cooperate in the joint enforcement of the intermunicipal agreement
and all ordinances enacted pursuant to the intermunicipal agreement and the
participating municipalities thereby agree cooperatively to exercise, to delegate to the
County, and to allow delegation of such powers, duties and responsibilities as set forth in
the intermunicipal agreement.
Duration of Term of the Agreement. The term of the intermunicipal agreement shall
commence upon the date on which the County and municipalities representing at least 60%
of the population of the County have executed the intermunicipal agreement and shall
terminate 40 years following that date, unless terminated earlier for cause.
Purpose and Objectives of Agreement. The purpose of the intermunicipal agreement is to

system to serve the County and the municipalities within the County, (2) to administer a
countywide recycling program, and (3) to provide continuing municipal waste planning, as
more fully set forth in the recitals to the intermunicipal agreement and this Part.
Manner and Extent of Financing the Agreement. Enforcement of this Part shall be financed by
the County's general revenues, except insofar as any participating municipality elects to
enforce this Part; administration of this Part, the recycling program, and planning shall be
financed by LCSWMA with revenues received from operation of the County system; and
construction and operation of the County system shall be financed by debt instruments issued
by LCSWMA and by operating revenues.
Organizational Structure Necessary to Implement the Agreement. LCSWMA shall be formed
from LARA by amendment of LARA's Articles of Incorporation; LCSWMA shall (1) construct
and operate or arrange for the construction and operation of the County system and (2)
administer this Part and waste flow ordinances adopted by participating municipalities
pursuant to the intermunicipal agreement; and the County and each participating municipality
shall enforce said waste flow ordinances with assistance from LCSWMA.
Management and Acquisition of Property. All property within the County system shall be
acquired, managed and disposed of by LCSWMA, in accordance with its separate agreement
with the County and the powers and duties imposed upon LCSWMA by law.
Execution. Appropriate officers of the County are authorized and directed to execute the
intermunicipal agreement on behalf of the County.
§ 20-112. County/LCSWMA Operations and Charges.
[Ord. 354, 1/12/1987, § 12]
The solid waste processing and disposal facilities proposed by the plan shall be operated efficiently
and economically by LCSWMA in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. All charges for
solid waste processing or disposal within the system shall be reasonable and uniform among all
classes of the users of the plant or plants from participating municipalities which execute the
intermunicipal agreement within 90 days of the date upon which DER grants preliminary approval to
the plan, provided, however, that different fees may be charged for different categories of waste and
for different points of entry into the system. Charges for disposal of solid waste generated outside of
the County shall be at least $2 per ton greater than for waste generated within a participating
municipality. Charges for disposal of solid waste generated within the County but not within a
participating municipality which executed the intermunicipal agreement within 90 days of the date upon
which DER grants preliminary approval to the plan may be the greater of $1 per ton greater than for
solid waste generated within a participating municipality or an amount sufficient to compensate
LCSWMA for any additional costs (administrative, engineering or construction) incurred or to be
incurred as a result of the municipality not executing the intermunicipal agreement within 90 days of
DER granting preliminary approval to the plan, provided, however, that the municipality may pay this
amount as a lump sum.
§ 20-113. Construction.
[Ord. 354, 1/12/1987, § 13]
The terms and provisions of this Part are to be liberally construed, so as best to achieve and to

[Ord. 00030, 7/11/2005, § 310; as amended by Ord. 00077, 4/14/2014, § 7]
When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the Borough shall furnish the
developer with a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon
the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan shall neither be signed nor
recorded until the financial improvement agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of

is not executed within 90 days from the date of said resolution unless a written extension is
granted by the Borough; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in
writing at the request of the developer.
Financial security required herein shall be in the form of a federal or commonwealth chartered
lending institution irrevocable letter of credit, a restrictive or escrow account in such institution or
with a financially responsible bonding company, or such other type of financial security which the
Borough may approve in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et
seq.
The said financial security shall provide for, and secure to the public the completion of all
subdivision improvements for which such security is being posted within one year of the date fixed
in the subdivision plan and subdivision agreement for such completion of such improvements
unless a later date is agreed to between the applicant and Borough Council. The amount of
financial security required shall be based upon estimates of the cost of completion of the required
improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and prepared by a professional engineer,
licensed in Pennsylvania, and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such costs. Borough Council, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate should the Borough Engineer feel that the estimate is unrealistically low. If
the applicant and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, the estimate shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of § 509(g) of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§ 10509(g).
Where development is projected over a period of years, Borough Council may authorize
submission of final plans by section or stage of development, subject to such requirements of
guarantees as to improvements in the future sections or stages of developments as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the development, and consistent with
the terms of § 508(4) of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10508(4).
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial
security may request Borough Council to release or authorize to be released, from time to time,
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor performing the
work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to Borough Council, and Borough Council
shall act on said request pursuant to the provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§ 10101 et seq. The Borough Engineer, in certifying the completion of work for a partial release,
shall not be bound to the amount requested by the applicant, but shall certify to Borough Council
his independent evaluation of the proper amount of partial releases. Borough Council may prior to
final release at the time of completion and certification by the Borough Engineer, require retention
of 10% of the estimated cost of the said improvements for maintenance and repair thereto for a
period of no more than 18 months following final release in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
The Borough shall have the right, but no duty, to allow the developer to combine security under
this chapter and Chapter 17 relating to stormwater management facilities if such combination is

the proposed use and the impacts associated with the proposed development plan.
Following is a brief narrative for each section of a traffic impact study:
Introduction. This section identifies the land use and transportation setting for the
site and its surrounding area.
Site and Study Area Boundaries. A brief description of the size of the land
parcel, general terrain features, legal right-of-way lines of the highway, and the
location within the jurisdiction and the region should be included in this section.
In addition, the roadways that afford access to the site and are included in the
study area should be identified. The exact limits of the study area should be
based on engineering judgment and an understanding of existing traffic
conditions at the site. In all instances, however, the study limits must be
mutually agreed upon by the developer, its engineer, and the Borough.
Site Description. This section should contain a brief narrative which describes
the proposed development in terms of its function, size and near and long term
growth potential. This description should be supplemented by a sketch which
clearly shows the proposed development within the site boundaries, its internal
traffic circulation pattern, and the location and orientation of its proposed access
points.
Existing and Proposed Site Uses. The existing and proposed uses of the site
should be identified in terms of the various zoning categories in the jurisdiction.
In addition, identify the specific use on which a request is made since a number
of uses may be permitted under the existing ordinances.

Existing and Proposed Nearby Uses. Include a complete description of the
existing land uses in the vicinity of the site as well as their current zoning. The
applicant should also state the proposed uses for adjacent land, if known. This
latter item is especially important where large tracts of underdeveloped land are
in the vicinity of the site and within the prescribed study area.
Existing and Proposed Roadways and Intersections. Within the study area,
describe existing roadways and intersections (geometries and traffic signal
control) as well as improvements contemplated by government agencies.
Analysis of the Existing Conditions. This section describes the results of the
volume/capacity analysis to be completed for the roadways and intersections in the
vicinity of the site under existing conditions as well as any data collection efforts that
are required.
Daily and Peak Hour(s) Traffic Volumes. Provide schematic diagrams depicting
daily and peak hour(s) traffic volumes for roadways within the study area.
Turning movement and mainline volumes are to be presented for the three peak
hour conditions (a.m., p.m., and site generated) while only mainline volumes are
required to reflect daily traffic volumes. Include the source and/or method of
computation for all traffic volumes.
Volume/Capacity Analysis at Critical Points. Utilizing techniques described in the
Highway Capacity Manual or derivative nomography, include an assessment of
the relative balance between roadway volumes and capacity. Perform the
analysis for existing conditions (roadway geometry and traffic signal control) for
the appropriate peak hours.
Level of Service at Critical Points. Based on the results obtained in the previous
section, levels of service (A through F in the Highway Capacity Manual) are to
be computed and presented. This section should also include a description of
typical operating conditions at each level of service.
Analysis of Future Conditions Without Development. This section describes the
anticipated traffic volumes in the future and the ability of the roadway network to
accommodate this traffic without the proposed zoning or subdivision request. The
future year(s) for which projections are made will be specified by the Borough and
will be dependent on the timing of the proposed development.
Daily and Peak Hour(s) Traffic Volume. Clearly indicate the method and
assumptions used to forecast future traffic volumes in order that the Borough
can duplicate these calculations. The schematic diagrams depicting future traffic
volumes will be similar to those described in subparagraph (3)(a) in terms of
locations and times (daily and peak hours).
Volume/Capacity Analyses at Critical Locations. Describe the ability of the
existing roadway system to accommodate future traffic (without site
development). If roadway improvements or modifications are committed for
implementation, present the volume/capacity analysis for these conditions.
Levels of Service at Critical Points. Based on the results obtained in the
previous section, determine levels of service (A through F in the Highway
Capacity Manual).
Trip Generation. Identify the amount of traffic generated by the site for daily and the
three peak conditions. Trip generation shall be based on published trip rates on the
latest revision of Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation Engineers.

Trip Distribution. Identify the direction of approach for site generated traffic for the
appropriate time periods. As with all technical analysis steps, the basic method and
assumptions used in this work must be clearly stated in order that the Borough can
replicate these results.
Traffic Assignment. Describe the utilization of study area roadways by site generated
traffic. The proposed traffic volumes should then be combined with anticipated traffic
volumes from subparagraph (2)(c) to describe mainline and turning movement
volumes for future conditions with the site developed as the applicant proposes.
Analysis of Future Conditions With Development. This section describes the
adequacy of the roadway system to accommodate future traffic with development of
the site:
Daily and Peak Hour(s) Traffic Volumes. Provide mainline and turning
movement volumes for the highway network in the study area as well as
driveways and internal circulation roadways for the appropriate time periods.
Volume/Capacity Analyses at Critical Points. Perform a volume/capacity
analysis for the appropriate peak hours for future conditions with the site
developed as proposed, similar to subparagraphs (3)(b)2) and (3)(b)3).
Levels of Service at Critical Points. As a result of the volume/capacity analysis,
compute and describe the level of service on the study area roadway system.
Final design must address both traffic flow and traffic safety considerations to
provide safe operational characteristics.
Recommended Improvements. In the event that the analysis indicates unsatisfactory
levels of service will occur on study area roadways, a description of proposed
improvements to remedy deficiencies should be included in this section. These
proposals would not include committed projects by the state and local jurisdictions.
Proposed Recommended Improvements. Describe the location, nature and
extent of proposed improvements to assure sufficient roadway capacity.
Accompanying this list of improvements are preliminary cost estimates, sources
of funding, timing, and likelihood of implementation.
Volume/Capacity Analyses at Critical Points. Another iteration of the
volume/capacity analysis will be described which demonstrates the anticipated
results of making these improvements.
Levels of Service at Critical Points. As a result of the revised volume/capacity
analysis presented in the previous section, present levels of service for the
highway system with improvements.
Conclusion. The last section of the report should be a clear concise description of
the study findings. This concluding section should serve as an executive summary.
Implementation. All requirements and suggestions arising out of such traffic studies
and/or those performed independently by municipal representatives on behalf of the
Borough, shall be designed and implemented by the owner as part of the
subdivision/land development process.

§ 22-504. Street Design.
[Ord. 00030, 7/11/2005, § 504]
Street Classification. Six functional classifications are hereby established for the streets and roads
in Akron Borough:
Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide intracounty or intermunicipal
traffic of substantial volumes where the average trip lengths are usually five miles or greater.
Generally, these highways should accommodate operating speeds of 35 to 55 miles per hour.
Arterial streets include: 7th Street (also designated Rt. 272), Main Street and Rothsville Road.
Collector. This classification is intended to include those highways which connect local access
highways to arterial highways. They may serve as traffic corridors connecting residential
areas industrial, shopping and other service areas. They may penetrate residential areas.
Generally, these highways will accommodate operating speeds of 35 miles per hour. Collector
streets include: Fulton Street, 3rd Street, 9th Street, 11th Street, Diamond Street.
Local Access. This classification is intended to include streets and roads that provide direct
access to abutting land and connections to higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will
be low and travel distances generally short. These streets and roads should be designed for
operating speeds of 25 miles per hour or under. Local access streets include all others as
listed on the Official Zoning Map.

Private Street. A local access street serving only abutting lots, that is not offered or required
to be offered for dedication.
Cul-de-sac Street. A local access street intersecting another street at one end, and
terminating at the other end by a permanent vehicular turnaround.
Alley. A public or private right-of-way width of 20 feet or less, which affords secondary means
of access to the rear or side of abutting commercial or industrial property and is not intended
for general traffic circulation. Regardless of whether an alley is given a street name, no
principal building shall have its frontage on an alley.
New Roads. The classifications for new roads shall be set, from time to time, by resolution of
Borough Council.
Right-of-Way Widths.
Minimum widths for each type of street shall be as follows:
Type of Street Right-of-Way Width Cart-way Width
Access 0 feet Two-way - 24 feet
One-way - 14 feet
Arterial PennDOT Standard PennDOT Standard
Collector 60 feet 38 feet
Local Access 50 feet 34 feet
Private 50 feet 20 feet
Alley 20 feet 16 feet
Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing public street or road having a
right-of-way width less than would be required if said street or road were created under this
chapter, sufficient additional width for right-of-way shall be provided and dedicated to meet
the forgoing standards.
Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the Borough Council to
promote public safety and convenience when special conditions require it and to provide
parking space in areas of intensive use.
Cul-de-Sac Streets.
Cul-de-sac streets, whether permanent or temporary, shall be provided at the closed end with
a turnaround having a minimum radius to the edge of the finished street or curbline of not less
than 50 feet. The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall be 10 feet greater than the radius of the
street.
Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turnaround right-of-way shall
be placed adjacent to a property line and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall
be carried to the property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the
adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is extended, the overage created by the
turnaround outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the
property owners fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround.
All commercial and industrial culs-de-sac shall be reviewed for adequacy by the Akron
Borough Engineer. His recommendations will be given to the Borough Council who shall have
final authority in this matter.
Permanent cul-de-sac streets shall have a minimum length of 250 feet and shall not exceed
500 feet in length, measured from the edge of the road/curbline of the intersected street to the

Ongoing Tax. The tax shall continue at the above rates during the current tax year and each tax
year thereafter, without annual re-enactment, until this Part is repealed or the rate is changed.
Combined Tax Rate Applicable to Residents. Currently, the total rate applicable to residents of the
taxing authority, including the tax imposed by the school district and municipality in which the
individual resides, is 1%. This combined tax rate is included solely for the purpose of providing
information applicable on the date of adoption of this Part. This combined tax rate might change if
the school district changes the tax rate imposed by the school district.
Local Tax Enabling Act Applicable. The tax is imposed under authority of the Local Tax Enabling
Act, and all provisions thereof that relate to a tax on earned income or net profits are incorporated
into this Part. Any future amendments to the Local Tax Enabling Act that are required to be applied
to a tax on earned income or net profits will automatically become part of this Part upon the
effective date of such amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this Part, to the
maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.

§ 24-104. Exemption From Tax-Individuals Under Age 16.
[Ord. 00060, 10/10/2011, § 24-104]
This Borough Council finds that:
Minors of various age groups have traditionally, and with judicial sanction, been considered as
comprising separate classes for many legislative purposes.
Minors under the age of 16 are generally unemancipated and subject to compulsory school
attendance and child labor laws, and therefore have limited earned income and net profits
and control of money such that enforcement of reporting and collection of tax hereunder
against them would yield inconsequential amounts and be unduly difficult, expensive, and not
in the public interest. For these reasons, individuals under the age of 16 years are exempt
from liability for the tax.
§ 24-105. Individual Tax Returns and Payments.
[Ord. 00060, 10/10/2011, § 24-105]

[Ord. 00060, 10/10/2011, § 24-109]
The primary purpose of this Part is to conform the earned income and net profits tax currently imposed
to the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended and restated by Act 32 of 2008, and to do so within the
time frame required by Act 32. Any prior enactment imposing a tax on earned income or net profits of
individuals is amended and restated in its entirety to read as stated in this Part. Any other prior
enactment or part of any prior enactment conflicting with the provisions of this Part is rescinded insofar
as the conflict exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in force immediately prior to adoption
of this Part, the provisions of this Part are intended as a continuation of such prior enactment and not
as a new enactment. If this Part is declared invalid, any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this Part. If any part of this Part
is declared invalid, the similar part of any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall remain in effect
and shall not be affected by adoption of this Part. The provisions of this Part shall not affect any act
done or liability incurred, nor shall such provisions affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be
initiated to enforce any right or penalty or to punish offense under the authority of any enactment in
force prior to adoption of this Part. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, this Part shall
amend and restate on the effective date any enactment levying a tax on earned income or net profits in
force immediately prior to the effective date. According the repeal of prior Chapter 24, Part 1, is subject
to the provisions of the aforesaid.

or specifically named. A trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by reference
to the heirs of the trust settler as determined by the law of the intestate succession shall not
disqualify a transfer from the exclusion provided by this clause. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the collector is presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly
identifies the grantor and all possible beneficiaries.

property, both real and personal, of such person but only after said lien has been entered and
docketed of record by the prothonotary of the county where such property is situated.
At any time after it makes an assessment of additional tax, penalty or interest, the Department
may transmit to the prothonotaries of the respective counties certified copies of all liens for
such taxes, penalties and interest, and it shall be the duty of each prothonotary receiving the
lien to enter and docket the same of record in his office, which lien shall be indexed as
judgments are now indexed. After the Department's assessment becomes final, a writ of
execution may directly issue upon such lien without the issuance and prosecution to judgment
of a writ of scire facias: Provided, that not less than 10 days before issuance of any execution
on the lien, notice shall be sent by certified mail to the taxpayer at his last known post office
address. No prothonotary shall require as a condition precedent to the entry of such liens, the
payment of any costs incident thereto.
The lien imposed hereunder shall have priority from the date of its recording as aforesaid, and
shall be fully paid and satisfied out of the proceeds of any judicial sale of property subject
thereto before any other obligation, judgment, claim, lien or estate to which said property may
subsequently become subject, except, costs of the sale and of the writ upon which the sale
was made, and real estate taxes and municipal claims against such property, but shall be
subordinate to mortgages and other liens existing and duly recorded or entered of record prior
to the recording of the tax lien. In case of a judicial sale of property subject to a lien imposed
hereunder upon a lien or claim over which the lien imposed hereunder has priority, as
aforesaid, such sale shall discharge the lien imposed hereunder to the extent only that the
proceeds are applied to its payment, and such lien shall continue in full force and effect as to
the balance remaining unpaid.
The lien imposed hereunder shall continue for five years from the date of its entry of record,
and may be renewed and continued in the manner now or hereafter provided for the renew of
judgments, or as may be provided in the Act of April 9, 1929, PL. 343, No. 176, known as the

the writ upon which the sale is made, and the sheriff, or other officer, conducting said sale shall pay the
tax herein imposed out of the first monies paid to him in connection therewith. If the proceeds of the
sale are insufficient to pay the entire tax herein imposed, the purchaser shall be liable for the remaining
tax.
§ 24-220. Enforcement.
[Ord. 00040, 12/10/2007, § 24-220]
In order to determine whether the proper amount of tax has been paid, without limiting any other

available to the Municipality any documents or records requested by the Municipality.

§ 5]
Upon the request of the owner of any property within the corporate limits of the Borough of Akron,
abutting upon a street wherein a water main exists or is reasonably adjacent thereto, the Borough
of Akron will approve a connection to the main, for said owner, to be constructed at said owner's
sole expense. All piping from the main to the property served, including curb shut off valve located
within five feet of curbline or edge of cartway and meter shall be installed for the owner at his
expense by a plumber recognized by the Borough of Akron. The Borough reserves the right to
require, in lieu of the meter being located in a building, a suitable protective pit directly opposite
the point at which the connection is made to the curb shut off valve. The Borough of Akron
reserves the right to repair at the property owner's expense any leak on a customer's service pipe
between the curb shut off valve and the water meter. A water meter shall be installed in such
piping, located inside the building equipped with an outside remote reading device which conforms
to municipal standards. On all existing connections and upon final inspection for new connections
the property owner is responsible for all maintenance of the water line from the building to the curb
shut off valve, for new connections on the building to within five feet of the curbline or cartway.
Each new water meter shall be furnished by the Borough of Akron at the expense of the property
owner. The Borough of Akron shall have the right to remove any such water meter for testing or for
maintenance and may furnish in its place another meter substantially the equal thereto as the
need for such replacement may occur, without incurring liability therefore to the owner. The
Borough of Akron shall inspect, test, adjust, maintain, and/or replace such meters at its own
expense, except that any meter damaged in service through the negligent act or omission of the
property owner or his tenant or agent shall be replaced by the Borough of Akron at the expense of
the property owner. Meter damage resulting from freezing or back flow of hot water shall be
considered to be the result of negligence on the part of the owner or tenant.
The accuracy of the water meters on the Borough of Akron's system shall be determined in
accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by resolution by Akron Borough Council. Upon
request of any user, the Borough of Akron will remove the meter from his premises and test the
accuracy thereof. If the said meter is found to register a greater quantity of water than passed
through it, to a degree exceeding the tolerance of accuracy prescribed by the Borough for such
cases, no charge shall be made for such test, and the bills for water rendered on the basis of the
registration of said meter for a period of not more than three months preceding the removal
thereof may be adjusted on an equitable basis. If the said meter is found to register a smaller
quantity of water than that passed through it, or to be within the prescribed tolerances of accuracy,
a charge shall be paid by the user for the testing of the meter in accordance with the schedule of
charges adopted from time to time by the Borough of Akron Council. Upon prior request, the water
user may witness the water test during normal working hours.
As long as water is piped to any building, the proper officials of the Borough of Akron shall at all
reasonable times have free access to the meters or service pipes to inspect, test, read, repair,
remove, or replace the same, whether or not the occupant of the building is a water user, and such
access shall not be impeded by coal, ashes, or rubbish, nor in any other manner. Failure to

Any customer of the Borough of Akron can request a supplementary meter for the purpose of
accessory uses that prohibit said water from entering the sanitary sewer system. All cost
associated with purchase and installation are the responsibility of the water customer. The
Borough will prescribe proper installation and conduct final inspection. Supplementary meters will
not be subject to minimum purchases.
In the event that a customer's water meter fails to register or is not read at the scheduled time, the
Borough of Akron may issue an estimated bill for the period involved based upon the records of
the same customer's usage for comparable past periods. Any inaccuracy resulting from failure to
read a user's meter at the regularly scheduled time will be corrected in the preparation of the bill
based upon the next reading of the meter.

Bills for water furnished for all purposes shall in general be rendered on a quarterly basis, a
quarter to consist of any period of approximately 90 days. A fractional part of a quarter equal to or
exceeding 45 days shall be considered a full quarter for the purpose of determining the minimum
charge. Upon request of any user, the Borough of Akron will remove the water meter from his
property and discontinue minimum charges thereon, and will thereafter upon request and payment
of a reconnection charge, established pursuant to a resolution of the Akron Borough Council,
reinstall the meter or a similar meter at the property and reestablish service.
Usage, service and minimum charges shall be payable at the Borough office on the date shown
on the bill rendered. Thereafter, a penalty, as set from time to time by resolution, shall become due
and payable. Failure to receive a bill shall not entitle an owner or user to an extension of time for
payment. Any owner or user whose account for utility service is in arrears shall pay the gross
amount of each bill until all outstanding indebtedness is paid.
If an employee or the Borough of Akron collects the amount of delinquent bill at the user's or
owner's premises prior to termination of service, a collection charge, established pursuant to a
resolution of the Akron Borough Council, shall be collected therewith.
Failure to pay either usage, service, or minimum charges within 10 days after the gross bill
becomes due shall be cause for termination of water service until payment is made of all
outstanding charges for water service; provided, in no case shall the water supply be shut off until
10 days after written notice of an intention so to do has been mailed to the person liable for
payment and a written notice has been posted at a main entrance to the premises where the water
supply is to be shut off. If during such ten-day period, the person liable for payment delivers to the
Borough of Akron a written statement which states under oath or affirmation that such statement is
not executed for purpose of delay and that he has a just defense to the claim for payment or to
part of such claim, the water supply shall not be shut off until such claim has been determined.
In the event that any property is disconnected from water service, because of failure to pay an
invoice or for any other reason relating to a violation of the provisions of this Part, a disconnection
charge shall be assessed (by resolution by Borough Council) against the delinquent invoice (in the
event of a non-delinquency against the rate payer). Further, a re-connection charge shall be
established (by resolution by Borough Council), which shall be paid in advance of such reconnection.

Akron, in writing, shall have been secured and only subject to such rules, regulations and
conditions as may be prescribed by the Borough of Akron.

Part 6. CONNECTION AND OTHER FEES
§ 26-601. Connection and Related Fees.
[Ord. 146, 6/4/1962, § 600; as added by Ord. 3-93, 11/1/1994, § II.C; and amended by Ord. 00065,
1/14/2013, § 1]
This Borough shall charge a connection fee in the amount of the actual cost incurred by the
Borough for each connection to the Borough's water lateral. In lieu of payment of said connection
fee the Borough may, at the discretion of the Borough, require the construction and dedication of
those facilities by the property owner or the owners requesting such connection. Upon the
occurrence of said event, the property owner or owners shall reimburse the Borough for its
reasonable expenses in supervising such connections.
The Borough does also hereby impose a customer facilities fee in the amount of the actual costs
incurred by the Borough for the facilities serving the connected property from the property line or
curb stop to the proposed dwellings or buildings to be served, where the Borough and not the
property owner or owners install the customer facilities. In lieu of the payment of the customer
facilities fee the Borough may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner or
owners requesting customer facilities. Upon occurrence of said event, the property owner or
owners shall reimburse the Borough for its reasonable expenses in supervising the construction of
such facilities.
The Borough Council shall, from time to time, establish a water tapping fee, by resolution of
Council, against the owner of any improved property whenever such owner hereafter shall connect
any such improved property with the water system or in the case as to capacity fee and
distribution fee parts, whenever use of the system is proposed to be increased. Said tapping fee

shall be established pursuant to provisions of applicable codes and may include a capacity fee, a
distribution fee, and reimbursement fee.
The capacities fee and the distribution fee parts of each tapping fee shall be due and payable for
each dwelling unit in multi-dwelling situations.
In each case of commercial or industrial users, the total tapping fee shall be modified by
adding a capacity fee and distribution fee parts sum computed by multiplying the sums set
forth in the capacity fee and the distribution fee parts times the number of equivalent dwelling
units estimated, in good faith, by the applicant to be the applicant's average daily usage over
the term of the first five years of use, but will never be less than one capacity fee and
distribution fee part.
In the event that the Borough is not satisfied with applicant's estimate, the Borough's
Engineer shall submit its own estimate. If the applicant is unwilling to accept the estimate of
the Borough's Engineer, then, in said event, a hearing shall be held before Council at which
time Council shall make a final decision on the matter.
The Borough shall have the right to actually measure water usage during each of said five
years and in the event that the applicant's good faith estimates prove too low or in the event
that the decision of the Borough is too low, applicant will promptly pay to the Borough, on an
annual basis, the corrected capacity fee and distribution fee parts then in effect times the
number of increased equivalent dwelling units actually used. Any overpayment made
hereunder shall be considered used for reservation of capacity and costs in processing and
shall not be refunded. Such capacity fee and distribution fee components shall be charged for
connection of each improved property or for adding of additional uses or units of occupancy
by the owner of such improved property.
The Borough shall also have the right to measure water usage at any time during which it is
believed that water usage has changed from that previously approved and previously
assessed. Owner will promptly pay to the Borough the corrected capacity fee and distribution
fee parts then in effect times the number of increased equivalent dwelling units actually used
or anticipated to be used. Any overpayments hereunder shall be considered for reservation of
capacity and costs in processing and shall not be refunded. Capacity fee and distribution fee
components shall be used for increased usages of equivalent dwelling units of water capacity
and shall be charged at the capacity fee and distribution fee components then in effect.
In the case of mobile home parks, trailer courts, campgrounds, shopping centers, apartments,
office buildings, hotels, motels, rooming house, nursing homes, industrial parks and all other
tracts wherever by lease, ownership, or contract there are multiple structures, divisions of
structures or separate sleeping quarters, or units of occupancy among separate owners,
lessees or residents, each unit of use or occupancy shall be considered as though it were a
separate unit and a separate capacity fee and distribution fee parts shall be paid thereafter,
except when a business or professional use is in connection with a dwelling unit occupied by
the same person who owns and operates the business or profession (and no persons are
employed therein). This provision shall apply to tapping fees only. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit, if otherwise authorized (and if all applicable monies are paid), single
laterals for multiple units under one ownership.
All fees shall be payable to the Treasurer of this Borough or to such other officer or
representative of this Borough as shall be authorized, from time to time, by resolution of this
Borough, to accept payment thereof.

Where a water line is to be extended at the expense of the owner or owners of property or where
this Borough otherwise would construct the customer facilities, the property owner or owners shall
have the right to construct the extension or install the customer facilities himself or themselves
through a subcontractor approved by the Borough, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, that the Borough shall have the right, at its option, to perform the construction
itself only if the Borough provides the extension or customer facilities at a lower cost and within the
same timetable specified or proposed by the property owner or owners or his or their approved
subcontractor.
Construction by the property owner or owners shall be in accordance with an agreement for the
extension of the Borough's system and plans and specifications approved by the Borough and
shall be undertaken only pursuant to the existing regulations, requirements, rules and standards of
the Borough applicable to such construction and shall be further subject to inspection by an
inspector authorized to approve such construction and employed by the Borough during
construction.
When a main is to be extended at the expense of the owner or owners of properties, in advance of
construction, the Borough's estimated reasonable and necessary costs of reviewing plans,
construction, inspections, administrative, legal and engineering services. Construction shall not
commence until the property owner or owners has posted appropriate financial security.
The property owner or owners shall reimburse the Borough for all its reasonable and necessary
expenses incurred as a result of the extension.
Upon completion of the construction, the property owner or owners shall dedicate, and the
Borough shall accept the extension of the Borough's system, provided dedication of facilities and
the installation complies with plans, specifications and regulations of the Borough and the
agreement between the Borough and the property owner.
Where the property owner constructs or causes to be constructed at his expense any extension of
the water system of the Borough, the Borough shall provide for the reimbursement to the property
owner when the owner of another property not in the development for which the extension was
constructed connects a service line directly to the extension to the Borough in accordance with the
following provisions:
Such reimbursement shall be equal to the distribution or collection part of each tapping fee
collected as a result of subsequent connections. The Borough shall deduct from each
reimbursement payment an amount equal to 5%, which shall be deemed to represent the
appropriate charge for administrative expenses and services rendered in calculating,
collecting, monitoring, and disbursing the reimbursement payments to the property owner
entitled thereto.
Reimbursement shall be limited to those lines which have not previously been paid for by the
Borough.
The Borough shall, in the preparation of the necessary reimbursement agreement with the
property owner or owners for whose benefit reimbursement will be provided, attach as an
exhibit an itemized listing of all water facilities for which reimbursement shall be provided.
The total reimbursement to which a property owner or owners shall be entitled shall not
exceed the cost of all labor and material, engineering design charges, the cost of
performance and maintenance bonds, Borough review and inspection charges, and any and
all charges involved in the acceptance and dedication of such facilities by the Borough, less
the amount which would be chargeable to such property owner based upon the Borough's
collection and distribution tapping fees which would be applicable to all lands of the property
owner or owners served directly or indirectly through such extensions if the property owner or
owners did not fund the extension.

In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general
welfare. Where the provisions of this chapter impose greater restrictions than those of any statute,
other ordinance, or regulation, the provision of this chapter shall be controlling. Where the
provisions of any statute, other ordinance or regulation impose greater restrictions than this
chapter, the provisions of such statute, other ordinance, or regulation shall be controlling. This

agreement between private parties. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions than
those imposed by such easement, covenant, or agreement, the provisions of this chapter shall
govern.
Further, this chapter shall be interpreted consistent with the provisions of the SWMO [Chapter 17]

are similar provisions between the SWMO [Chapter 17], the SALDO [Chapter 22] and this chapter,
the greater restrictions shall apply, including provisions that can be consistently applied among the
three Chapters.

From the late 1950s to the present, the type of housing in the Borough changed substantially from
that found in the central core of the Borough to that found in those areas other than the central
core.
The primary type of housing previously was single-family detached dwellings on small lots. Such
dwellings were constructed of wood or similar materials, with vary small yards.
That changed in the 1950s and continues to this day, so that almost all the construction of singlefamily
detached dwellings has been on substantially larger lots (12,000 square feet or more) and a
substantial number of those dwellings have been built of brick, stone or masonry and have
significant setbacks and yards. The purpose of the R-1 District is to recognize the historical
evolution of those types of dwellings in those areas and to preserve that legitimate dwelling type
for future generations. The Borough has made adequate provisions for other types of dwellings in
its other districts and believes that the preservation of single-family detached dwellings on what
are relatively large lots (although quite small compared to surrounding municipalities and
surrounding townships) is a legitimate community development objective of the Borough that shall
be pursued.
To this end the Borough has created the R-1 zoning district where the only permitted residential
use is single-family detached dwellings on larger lots (12,500 square feet or more) and only those
other uses that encourage the open use of space so to . . . Additionally, businesses in these areas
should be severally restricted so that they do not create any kind of intrusion on this legitimate
residential usage.

Part 8. RESIDENTIAL-2 (R-2)
§ 27-801. Purpose.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 801]
The R-2 zoning district is the remainder of what was formerly zoned R-2 in the Borough and what
has not been rezoned as R-1 and is not part of the new zoning district R-3.
The purpose of the R-2 zoning district is to provide a transition between the R-1 and the R-3, to
reflect a different legitimate housing need, and to also reflect a different currently existing housing
type.
The housing types in the R-2 District consist of mixtures of single-family detached and multifamily.
The density however is much higher than in the R-1.
The Borough believes that the essential character of the R-2 District should be preserved by
allowing single-family detached dwellings as of right, and other types of nondense residential uses
as special exceptions. Lots should not have significant lot size requirements and setbacks should
be significantly smaller then in the R-1, but because of the already built up nature of most of this
area it is important that parking and similar issues be addressed. Again the primary purpose of the
district is residential dwelling. Therefore, commercial uses should be restricted so to not impose
an unnecessary burden on the residential uses. These community development objectives are
legitimate and shall be implemented in the Borough.

[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1001]
The Borough of Akron, being a community created well over 100 years ago, significantly prior to
zoning, found the evolution of its industrial uses dependent more on foot and rail traffic than
anything else.
Accordingly, in 1996, there are at most three operating industrial establishments left in the
Borough, none of which are of any size, and all which are scattered at locations and in buildings
where similar uses existed for well over 40 years.
Because of the extreme density of residential development in the Borough and the lack of land for
any size of industrial use, the Borough believes it would be ill-advised to allow major industrial
uses to be permitted. The Borough with its history of experiencing some industrial uses in the
middle of residential districts has found that these existing industrial uses in residential areas have
caused significant problems. There is no other land on which to build any kind of substantial
industrial use. Additionally, any substantial industrial use would significantly intrude upon the
residential bedroom community character of the Borough.
Accordingly, the Borough has eliminated the very small Industrial District from its zoning (all the
land in that district is now occupied by commercial uses) but will allow the provision of light
industry of a limited nature within its C-1 District. The C-1 District's primary purpose, however, is
for commercial development along the transportation corridor of Route 272.
Towards that end, residential development in that area should be discouraged and the inter-mixing
of residential, commercial, and industrial should be prevented to the greatest extent possible.
Accordingly, the Borough has re-zoned a significant portion of both sides of Route 272 for
commercial uses so to encourage those uses along that transportation corridor where there can
be access to them by the traveling public from adjacent municipalities. These community

[Amended by Ord. No. 00093, 5/14/2018; and by Ord. No. 00096, 4/8/2019]
§ 27-1005. Screening.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1005]
Where the sides adjoin a residential use or a residential zoning district all commercial, industrial
and nonresidential uses shall be screened from all rear property lines and side property lines by a
planting area.
In order for the Zoning Officer to determine compliance with the requirements of this section, a
plan must be submitted showing the proposed design and make up of the landscape screen. Any
screen shall be designed so as to not restrict clear site triangles for vehicles.
A screen may be composed of a combination of shrubs, trees, or earthen berms. The shrubs shall
have a minimum initial height of three feet measured from parking surface level at the time of
planting. Trees shall have a minimum height of six feet from parking surface level and a trunk

caliper of at least 1 1/2 inches at time of planting. Deciduous trees, where allowed, shall have a
height of at least 10 feet from parking surface level. Earthen berms, if any, shall have a minimum
height of one foot.
The plants selected for use in the landscape screen shall be suited for such plantings and be
arranged in such a manner as to provide an effective visual barrier within two years of planting,
and shall be reasonably approved in advance by the Zoning Officer. The Borough encourages
naturalistic plant designs which enhance the visual effect of the landscape along public streets.
§ 27-1006. Planting Strips.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1006]
All parking lots with more than 10 parking spaces shall be separated from all street rights-of-way
by a planting strip. All planting strips as described in this section shall be a minimum of five feet
wide.
Each planting strip shall be planted in grass, shrubbery, trees, or other plant material. In no case
shall these areas be paved or covered by an impervious surface. Planting strips shall only be
broken by approved entrances or exits. Accessory buildings shall not be permitted within a
planting strip. Planting strips shall be designed so as to not restrict clear site triangles for vehicles.
Part 11. COMMERCIAL MIXED - C-M
§ 27-1101. Purpose.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1101]
The purpose of this zoning district is to reflect the historical core of the Borough along Main Street,
where uses have evolved to a mixture of very light commercial and higher density residential. This
area provides for higher density residential uses than those in the R-1 District (although not as
dense as in the R-3 District), but encourages the mixtures of such residential uses and smaller
scale commercial uses.
This mixed density area is not intended to be or consist of substantially all commercial uses, but is
intended to be intermixed where nonintrusive commercial uses can live in peace with higher
density residential uses. To that end the commercial uses are not as intense as those allowed in
the C-1 District. Also to that end, the residential uses are not as restrictive as that provided in the
R-1 and R-2 Districts.
The intent is to reserve the old (pre-twentieth century) "Main Street character," as it has been the
essential core of the Borough.
The housing types in this section of the Borough are generally those built prelate 1950s and
consist of the more traditional small lots, small yards, large size residential dwellings, built of
siding or masonry. The use of these types of structures and the conversion of some to multifamilies
or co-usage as commercial and residential, is not to be discouraged where safety, parking
and aesthetics allow. These Community development objectives are legitimate and shall be
implemented in the Borough.

§ 27-1204. Home Occupations and Home Businesses.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1204]
Background. The Borough recognizes the need to establish regulations pertaining to home-based
occupations and businesses that have arisen as a result of the increased need for the diversity of
income to help offset the rising cost of living. The Borough also recognizes the potential benefits to
the local community which could be realized by those seeking services or goods supplied through
home occupations. However, these positive aspects must be weighed against the potential
impacts of such uses on the character of the neighborhoods and health and safety issues.
Purpose. It is the intent of this section to establish regulations which will permit home occupations
and home businesses in a manner which will preserve the peace, quiet, and tranquility of
residential neighborhoods and to ensure the compatibility of such uses with other uses permitted
within the same zoning districts.
Requirements for Home Occupations. Any dwelling may contain a home occupation and all
dwellings containing a home occupation shall comply with the following:
There shall be no retail sales of goods on the premises.
All persons involved in the home occupation shall be full-time residents.
There shall no evidence from the exterior that the dwelling is being utilized for purposes other
than a dwelling.
No signs shall be utilized.
There shall be no increased need for additional off-street parking.
No more than 20% of the gross floor area of the dwelling unit, excluding attics, porches,
garages, and basements, may be used for the practice of a home occupation.

§ 27-1212. Adult Entertainment Establishments.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1212]
Purpose and Legislative Intent.
It is hereby declared a matter of legislative declaration and belief that the morals of minors of
Akron Borough are threatened by the presence of adult entertainment establishments as said
term is hereinafter defined. These establishments, and the type and character of the
merchandise, paraphernalia and services sold in them, create an atmosphere of enticement
for minors of Akron Borough that is increased by the lascivious and suggestive advertising
often employed to promote the availability of these products and services. It is the intent of
the Borough Council to minimize the exposure of these establishments.
It is the firm belief of Council that it has a vital duty and role to protect the moral fiber and
standards of its residents, in particular the minors of the community.
The location of adult entertainment establishments is of vital concern to society with regard to
their location near areas where minors may learn, play, pass by, or would be exposed to the
advertising, window displays, or the general atmosphere encompassing their operation. The
legislative body finds that adult entertainment establishments, because of their very nature,
are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several
of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect
upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these businesses is necessary to insure that these
adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhoods.
It is the intent of the Borough Council in enacting these regulations relative to adult
entertainment establishments to exercise only those powers granted to it. These regulations
shall in no way be deemed to permit any adult entertainment establishment, as defined
herein, which would otherwise be prohibited or in any way regulated by any other obscenity
ordinance, and other state, county or local ordinances.

procedures of this section.
To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the
respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this
section, but without a requirement for permits.
To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this section.
To provide for enforcement of the provisions of this section.
Computations. The following regulations shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
Computation of Area of Individual Signs.
The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only
one face) shall be computed by measuring the outside edges of the structure (but
excluding poles or other support that do not contain a part of the sign).
In the case of canopies, which contain a part of which shall be a sign, the area of the sign
on the canopy shall be computed by the means of the smallest square, triangle, rectangle
or circle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an
integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed.
Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face
shall be computed by computing the largest area of the largest sign face.
Computation of Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
greater of the base of the sign or its pole at normal grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the grade after construction,
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the
sign.
Design, Construction, and Maintenance. All signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with the following standards:
Except for banners, flags, yard sale signs, temporary signs and window signs conforming in
all respects with the requirements of this section, all signs shall be constructed of permanent
materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building or another structure by
direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame or structure.
All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition.
Signs Permitted in All Districts. Signs listed in this section are permitted in all zoning districts as
defined in this chapter and shall not require permits (except certain real estate marketing signs as
defined herein below) and shall not be counted when calculating the number of signs on a
premises; however, such signs shall conform with the general regulations for signs enumerated in
the remainder of this section:

commercial advertising, of not more than two square feet in sign area.
No Trespassing Signs. No trespassing signs or other such signs regulating the use of a
property, such as "No Hunting" and "No Fishing," of not more than two square feet in sign
area in residential districts, and five square feet in all nonresidential districts.

provided, however, that specific dimensional standards established for
interior yards shall apply in the event of inconsistency with this standard.
Existing buildings and structures may be integrated into and used as part of
an organizational headquarters campus even if such buildings and
structures do not comply with the current front yard setback requirements.

An interior yard of 40 feet is required between end walls of buildings. If the
buildings are at right angles to each other, the distance between the
corners of the end walls of the building may be reduced to a minimum of 20

of this chapter, Borough Council may reduce the minimum total parking space
allocation to the number of spaces shown by the owner's evidence to be adequate.
Any parking space allocation so reduced shall be made a condition of an approved
conditional use. As part of the conditional use review process, Borough Council may
(at its discretion) allow the use of existing parking areas as part of an organizational
headquarters campus even if such parking areas do not meet all of the parking
requirements set forth in § 27-1205 or do not satisfy the applicable yard and set back
requirements, if such parking is deemed adequate by Borough Council for the use(s)
proposed and does not create or worsen safety or aesthetic concerns.

Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
It shall be unlawful for any person to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Akron Floodplain Zoning District, unless a permit
has been obtained from the Borough's Zoning Officer.

§ 27-1403. Permitted Uses, Height, Bulk, Setback and Area
Regulations; Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997; as amended by Ord. 00027, 4/11/2005; by Ord. 00076, 4/14/2014; and by
Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
The permitted and special execution uses permitted in the Floodplain (FP) Zoning District shall be
the same as those permitted and special exception uses in the Residential-1 (R-1) Zoning District
set forth in §§ 27-702 and 27-703 of this chapter, except that schools shall not be permitted in the
Floodplain (FP) Zoning District. The height, bulk, setback and area regulations of § 27-704 of this
chapter related to uses and structures in the Residential-1 (R-1) shall also apply except, to the
extent the other provisions of this Part 14 are more restrictive than the more restrictive of the
provisions of this Part 14 shall apply and in all respects supersede those in the Residential-1 (R-1)
Zoning District.
This Part supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent
that those provisions are more restrictive, including, but not limited to, Chapter 22, the Akron
Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance ("SALDO"), Chapter 17, the Akron
Borough Stormwater Management Ordinance ("SWMO"), and the other provisions of this Part. If
there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this Part with the remainder of Chapter 27,

Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Part shall be declared invalid
for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this Part, which
shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Part are hereby declared
to be severable.

Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Part is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This Part does not imply that areas outside any identified
floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
The granting of a permit or making of any other administrative decision under this Part shall not
constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the Borough, or by any official,
agent or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan
proposed with respect to damage from flood or otherwise, and shall create no liability or cause of
action against the Borough, its agents or employees.

After the issuance of a permit by the Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to
the application, permit or any of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application without the written consent or approval of the Floodplain Administrator. Requests for any
such change shall be in writing and shall be submitted by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator

Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
In addition to the permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a placard, or similar document, which
shall be displayed on the premises during the time construction is in progress. This placard shall show
the number of the permit, the date of its issuance, and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
§ 27-1414. Start of Construction.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997; as amended by Ord. 00027, 4/11/2005; by Ord. 00076, 4/14/2014; and by
Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within 180 days after the date of
issuance of the development permit. Work shall also be completed within 12 months after the date
of issuance of the permit or the permit shall expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing,
by the Floodplain Administrator. The issuance of development permit does not confer Zoning,
SWMO, UCC or SALDO approval.
The "actual start of construction" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request
and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the

Ord. 00087, 3/14/2016]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and
which represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation.
This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in
the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided but no floodway has been determined.
No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within
any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the BFE at any point.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50
feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.

Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified by
the municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
When the Borough of Akron proposes to permit the following encroachments: any development
that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring
in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause any rise in the base
flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to, installing
culverts and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the encroachments
to occur.
Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior to approving
the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.
Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide as-built
certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications in

Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
In reviewing any request for a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider, at a
minimum, the following:
That there is good and sufficient cause.
That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.

Variances.
Section 910.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10910.2, states
the following:
The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this
chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe
the form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The
Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this
chapter and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford
relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
In granting any variance, the Board may attached such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this act and this
chapter.
The Board shall hear requests for Variances pursuant to the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
Special Exceptions.
Where this chapter has stated special exceptions to be granted or denied by the Zoning
Hearing Board, the Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in
accordance with such standards and criteria.
Each applicant shall additionally bear the burden of proving for each use or structure
compliance with the following:

Decision.
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1508]
If the variance is granted or the issuance of a permit is finally approved, or other action by the

respective functions.

failure to complete such construction or alteration within said one-year period and if the Board or
Borough Council, as appropriate in accordance with the respective functions, further finds that
conditions have so altered or changed in the interval since the granting of the variance, permit, or
action, that revocation or rescission of the action is justified.

§ 27-1511. Validity of This Chapter (Curative Amendment).
[Ord. 12-8-97A, 12/8/1997, § 1510]
A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the validity of this chapter or map
or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which the
landowner has an interest shall submit the challenge either to the Zoning Hearing Board or to the
Borough Council, together with a request for a curative amendment.
Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of another by this chapter or
map, or any provision thereof, who desire to challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first
submit their challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon.
The submissions referred to in subsection .1 and .2 shall be governed by the following:
In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging party shall make a written
request to the Board that it hold a hearing on its challenge. The request shall contain the
reasons for the challenge. Where the landowner desires to challenge the validity of such
ordinance and elects to proceed by curative amendment, the landowner's application to the
Borough Council shall contain, in addition to the requirements of the written request hereof,
the plans and explanatory materials describing the use or development proposed by the
landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by the challenged ordinance or map.
Such plans or other materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed for
preliminary, tentative, or final approval or for the issuance of a permit, so long as they provide
reasonable notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for evaluating
the challenged ordinance or map in light thereof. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the
landowner from first seeking a final approval before submitting the landowner's challenge.
If the submission is made by the landowner to the Borough Council, the request also shall be
accompanied by an amendment or amendments to this chapter proposed by the landowner to
cure the alleged defects therein.
If the submission is made to the Borough Council, the Borough Solicitor shall represent and
advise it at the hearing or hearings.
The Borough Council may retain an independent attorney to present the defense of the
challenged ordinance or map on its behalf and to present witnesses on its behalf.
Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the Borough Council or the
Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be, shall determine whether the challenged
ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a challenge heard by the
Borough Council is found to have merit, the Borough Council shall proceed. If a challenge
heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing
Board shall include recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance which will cure
the defects found. In reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the
amendments, plans, and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also

floodplains, natural resources, and natural features, the degree to which these are
protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development, and any adverse
environmental impacts.
The impact of the proposal on the preservation of other land uses which are essential to
public health and welfare.
The Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be, shall render its
decision in compliance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of this chapter or map is in
question and shall give the place where and the times when a copy of the request, including any
plans, explanatory material, or proposed amendments maybe examined by the public.
The challenge shall be deemed denied when one of the following occurs:
The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be, fails to commence the
hearing within the time limits required by law.
The Borough Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt the curative amendment.
The Borough Council adopts another curative amendment which is unacceptable to the
landowner.
The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be, fails to act on the
request 45 days after the close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is extended
by mutual consent by the landowner and Borough.
Where a curative amendment proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment
application by the Borough Council or a validity challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing
Board or the court acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative amendment proposal or a
validity challenge, and the proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two years from the date of such
approval to file an application for preliminary or tentative approval. Within the two-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision, or other governing ordinance or
plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted
in the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Where the proposal appended to
the curative amendment application or the validity challenge is approved but does not require
further application under any subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer shall have
one year within which to file for a building permit. Within the one-year period, no subsequent
change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision, or other governing ordinance or plan shall be
applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge.
