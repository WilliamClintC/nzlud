plan on the day prior to the restatement date shall continue to be a
participant on and after the restatement date, subject to the terms and
conditions of the plan as set forth herein. Each other person shall

required to make contributions to the plan, as provided in § 603,
Subsection 1, of this Part, and shall execute and complete any

reason shall be eligible to participate pursuant to Subsection 1 of this
section as of the date such eligibility requirements are met.
4. Change in Status. In the event a participant who remains in the service

hereunder, or who ceases or fails to make any contributions which are
required as a condition of participation hereunder, no further benefit

on the date on which the leave of absence commenced.

§ 604. Retirement Benefits. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002, Art. IV]
1. Employee Contributions. As a condition of participation in the plan,
each employee shall contribute to the plan by payroll deduction. Each
participant shall contribute an amount equal to 2% of the participant's
compensation. Each employee must have executed the appropriate
documents authorizing the employer to deduct the contributions from
the pay of the employee. Such contributions shall be required until such
time as the employer, consistent with any provisions of applicable law,
shall reduce or eliminate the requirement. For a participant who is on
an authorized leave of absence, the obligation to contribute hereunder
shall be waived during the period of such authorized leave of absence.
2. Employer Contributions. The employer shall contribute to the plan the
amount determined by the plan's actuary and certified by the chief
administrative officer as the amount which is necessary to adequately
fund the benefits hereunder in accordance with the requirements of the
Act, as provided in § 612, Subsection 2, of this Part. The contributions of
the employer for a given year may be reduced by other contributions to
the plan including, but not limited to, employee contributions, state aid
contributions or gifts.
3. State Aid Contributions. Payments of general municipal pension system
state aid, or any other amount of state aid payments in accordance with
the Act, which are received by the employer and deposited into the
pension fund shall be used to the extent permitted pursuant to the Act
to reduce the unfunded liability or, after such liability has been funded,
to apply against the annual obligation of the employer for future service
costs or, to the extent that the payment may be in excess of such
obligation, to reduce employee contributions hereunder.
4. Gifts. To the extent permitted by law, the plan administrator may accept
gifts, outright or in trust, for deposit into the pension fund. The
application of such gifts shall be governed by the rules of the plan and
such directions prescribed by the donor as are not inconsistent with the
rules of the plan and applicable law. Such gifts shall be applied in the
same manner as state aid contributions.
5. No Reversion to the Employer. At no time shall it be possible for the
plan assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution
is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the
contribution, the plan is terminated, as provided in § 611 of this Part, or
as otherwise permitted by the laws of this Commonwealth.
1. Normal Retirement. A participant who retires upon attainment of
normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a monthly retirement
benefit in an amount equal to 30% of the participant's final monthly
average compensation plus an extended service increment (not to
§ 603 SAINT MARYS CODE § 604
FWD:116
exceed $100 a month) of 1% of the participant's final monthly average
compensation for years of credited service in excess of 25 years paid in
the normal form commencing on the first day of the month coincident
with or next following the date of retirement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the normal retirement benefit shall not be less than $18
multiplied by the credited service.
2. Early Retirement. A participant who terminates employment after
attaining early retirement age shall be entitled to any early retirement
benefit in an amount equal to the accrued benefit to the date of early
retirement. The early retirement benefit shall be payable in the normal
form commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next
following the date of retirement.
3. Late Retirement. A participant who retires after the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date on which normal
retirement age has been attained shall receive a retirement benefit
pursuant to Subsection 1 of this section in an amount equal to the
amount calculated as of the date on which actual retirement occurs.
4. Disability Benefit. A member who becomes disabled after he has
completed 10 years of credited service will be entitled to a total and
permanent disability pension after being disabled for a period of six
months. The amount of the pension will be equal to the pension accrued
to the date of disability. The disability pension shall continue until death
or recovery from disability prior to normal retirement age. In the event
a disabled employee recovers from disability and returns to the service
of the City, his subsequent retirement pension shall be based on service
rendered prior to disability plus service rendered after recovery from
disability. The existence and continuance of disability shall be
determined by the Board upon the advice of a physician or a panel of
physicians selected by the Board. Disability retirement benefits shall be
available only to members who were active employees of the City at the
time disability is incurred.
5. Application for Benefit. A participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit on a form and in the manner prescribed by the
plan administrator and deliver the said application to the plan
administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit
payments are to commence. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments or any other
benefit payments shall be due or payable on or before the first day of
the month coincident with or next following the date that is 30 days
after the date the plan administrator receives the application for
benefits.
6. Nonduplication of Benefit. A participant who shall be receiving a
monthly retirement benefit under this plan and who shall resume
employment as an employee, shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Such benefit payments shall be
§ 604 FOREWORD § 604
FWD:117
adjusted to reflect any previous pension payments received and any
additional service or change in compensation.
7. Small Amounts. If the value of a participant's accrued benefit is equal to
or less than $5,000, the plan administrator shall cause the vested
accrued benefit to be paid in a lump sum.
8. Cessation of Benefit Payments. Any pension benefit payable hereunder
shall be payable through and including the later of the month in which
such participant's death occurs or the month in which any period
certain payments due on or after the participant's death have been
paid. Any survivor annuity payable on or after the participant's death in
accordance with the form of pension benefit elected shall be paid
through the month in which such surviving annuitant's death occurs.
9. Special Provision for Restated Plans. The benefit amount of any
participant who may have retired prior to the restatement date shall not
be in any way altered by the provisions of this plan, except where
otherwise expressly indicated herein, and shall continue to be
determined on the basis of the terms of the plan in effect on the day
preceding the restatement date.
10. Maximum Benefit Limitations.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, no benefit
provided under this Part attributable to contributions of the City
shall exceed, as an annual amount, $90,000, assuming a single life
annuity or qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined for
purposes of Code § 415), subject to cost-of-living adjustments made
from time to time by plan amendments or automatically in
accordance with and in such amounts as are prescribed in or
pursuant to regulations promulgated under Code § 415(d) (which
adjustments shall not become effective prior to January 1 of the
year for which such adjustment is made) and the rate of benefit
accrual shall be frozen or reduced accordingly, subject to the
provisions of Subsection 10B below.
B. The limitation provided in Subsection 10A above shall be subject to
the following conditions:
(1) For purposes of the above limitation, if the benefit under the
plan is payable in any form other than in the forms described
therein (without regard to ancillary benefits) or if the
employees contribute to the plan or make rollover
contributions, the determination as to whether the limitation
has been satisfied shall be made by adjusting the benefit so
that it is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit described in
Subsection 10A. For the purpose of making the adjustment in
the form of the benefit to an actuarial equivalent, the interest
rate shall not be less than the greater of 5% or the rate
specified under the plan's definition of "actuarial equivalent."
§ 604 SAINT MARYS CODE § 604
FWD:118
(2) If retirement income benefits commence prior to a
participant's attainment of age 62, the limitation contained in
Subsection 10A shall be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of
a $90,000 annual benefit commencing at age 62. The reduction
under this paragraph shall not reduce the limitation of
Subsection 10A below $75,000 if the benefit begins at or after
55, or, if the benefit begins before age 55, the amount which is
the equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for age 55. For the
purpose of making this adjustment, the interest rate used shall
not be less than the greater of 5% or the rate specified in the
plan's definition of "actuarial equivalent." The above
adjustment shall not apply with respect to disability or survivor
benefits under the plan.
(3) If retirement income benefits commence after the participant's
attainment of age 65, the limitation described in Subsection
10A shall be adjusted so that such limitation (as so increased)
equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement
income benefit begins) which is the actuarial equivalent of a
$90,000 annual benefit commencing at age 65. For the purpose
of making this adjustment, the interest rate assumption shall
not be greater than the lesser of 5% or the rate specified in the
plan's definition of "actuarial equivalent."
(4) Benefits payable to a participant under this Part shall be
deemed not to exceed the limitation imposed by Subsection
10A if the annual benefit payable to such participant does not
exceed $10,000 (for this year or any prior year), provided that
such participant has never participated in a defined
contribution plan maintained by the employer.
(5) In the event a participant (other than a participant receiving
disability benefits under the plan) has less than 10 years of
service, the limitations described in Subsections 10A and
10B(2) of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years of service credited
to the participant and the denominator of which is 10.
(6) For purposes of applying the limitations of this section, all
defined benefit plans of the Borough shall be treated as one
defined benefit plan, and all defined contributions plans shall
be treated as one defined contribution plan.
(7) For purposes of the above limitations, the limitation year shall
be the plan year, unless such period is otherwise defined in a
written resolution adopted by the employer.
11. Incorporation of Code § 415 by Reference. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Part to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments and
other requirements prescribed in this Part shall at all times comply with
the provisions of Code § 415 and the regulations thereunder (as such
§ 604 FOREWORD § 604
FWD:119
apply to governmental plans), the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. Thus, for the first 415 limitation
year beginning after December 31, 1994, the applicable mortality table
described in Rev. Ruling 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80 shall be utilized, and
effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1997, the term
compensation for Code § 415 purposes, in accordance with
§ 415(c)(3)(D) of the Code and Treasury Regulation § 1.415-2(d), shall
include:
A. An elective deferral [as defined in Code § 402(g)(3)]; and
B. Any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at
the election of the employee and which is includable in gross
income of the employee by reason of Code § 125 or 457.
12. Qualified Domestic Relations Order Distribution. All rights and benefits,
including elections, provided to a participant in this plan shall be
subject to the rights afforded to any alternate payee pursuant to a
domestic relations order as provided by applicable state law. In
evaluating any such domestic relations order, Code § 414(p) may be
used as a guide.
13. Direct Rollover.
A. Notwithstanding any provisions of the plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by
the distributee in a direct rollover.
B. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except
that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); and the
portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
(2) An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account
described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity
described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code
§ 403(a) or a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a) that
accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
§ 604 SAINT MARYS CODE § 604
FWD:120
However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the
surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual
retirement account or individual retirement annuity.
(3) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code § 414(p), are
distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse.
(4) A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
C. Effective Date. This section shall apply to distributions made after
December 31, 2001.
(1) Modification of Definition of Eligible Retirement Plan. For
purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this Subsection 13,
an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract
described in § 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under
§ 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political
subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a
state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to
separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
from this plan. The definition of "eligible retirement plan" shall
also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or
to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under
a qualified domestic relation order, as defined in § 414(p) of the
Code.
(2) Modification of Definition of Eligible Rollover Distribution to
Include After-Tax Employee Contributions. For purposes of the
direct rollover provisions in this Subsection 13, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution
merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions which are not includable in gross income.
However, such portion may be paid only to an individual
retirement account or annuity described in § 408(a) or (b) of
the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described
in §§ 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is not so
includable.
14. Credit for Qualified Military Service. Notwithstanding any provision of
this plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with
respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with
§ 414(u) of the Code.
§ 604 FOREWORD § 605
FWD:121
§ 605. Payment of Benefits. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002, Art. V]
1. "Normal form" shall mean for the payment of a normal retirement
benefit, an early retirement benefit, a late retirement benefit or a
disability retirement benefit as follows:
A. For those participants who are married for at least one year on the
date of retirement, a monthly annuity for the life of the participant
and on the participant's death, 1/2 of the participant's monthly
annuity payable to the spouse for her lifetime.
B. For those participants who die prior to retirement, there shall be
paid to the beneficiary the present value of the participant's
accrued benefit at the date of death. In no event will the death
benefit be less than the participant contributions account. In the
event no beneficiary designation is on file at the time of the death of
the participant, the payment shall be made in the following order:
(1) Spouse;
(2) Living children; and
(3) The estate of the deceased.
2. Commencement Benefits. A participant may elect to commence
receiving distribution of retirement benefits as of the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date on which retirement
occurs with an eligibility to receive benefits.
3. Required Distributions.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the entire benefit
of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to his
death shall be distributed either:
(1) Not later than the required beginning date.
(2) Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the
lives of such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a
period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
participant, or the joint life expectancies of such participant
and a designated beneficiary).
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
prior to the date when his entire interest has been distributed
to him after distribution of his benefits has begun in
accordance with Subsection 3A(2) of this section, the
remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least
as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used
under Subsection 3A(2) of this section as of the date of his
death.
§ 605 SAINT MARYS CODE § 605
FWD:122
B. If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of his benefit has begun the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2 and, further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin this subsection shall be applied
as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
C. For purposes of this section, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(1) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2, or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
(2) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its
rules.
(3) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
(4) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than
annually.
4. Personal Right of Participant. Each participant's right to receive any
benefits hereunder is personal and expires on such participant's death.
No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee or other person claiming
by or through a participant shall have any interest in any benefits
hereunder unless clearly and expressly so provided by the terms of this
§ 605 FOREWORD § 605
FWD:123
§ 606. Termination of Employment. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002, Art. VI]
plan. A participant's election, failure to file an election hereunder or
revocation of an election shall be final and binding on all persons.
1. Rights of Terminated Employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided, shall be limited to
those rights under the plan contained in the following sections of this
Part.
2. Distribution of Accumulated Contributions. A participant whose
employment ceased for any reason before completion of one year of
service shall be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated
contributions account. Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions
account, said participant, survivor and his or her beneficiary shall not
be entitled to any further payments from the plan.
3. Deferred Vested Benefit. A participant who has completed at least one
year of credited service and whose employment with the employer shall
terminate for any reason prior to attainment of normal retirement age
shall be entitled to elect to receive a deferred vested benefit in lieu of a
distribution of accumulated contributions under Subsection 2 of this
section. The election hereunder shall be made within 90 days prior to
the date on which the participant's employment shall cease or shall be
forever waived and a distribution pursuant to Subsection 2 of this
section shall occur. Such a deferred vested benefit shall be in an
amount equal to the participant's accrued benefit as of the date
employment terminates multiplied by the following vesting percentage:
Number of Years of Credited
Service Vesting Percentage
1 14.25%
2 28.50%
3 42.75%
4 57.00%
5 71.25%
6 85.50%
7 or more 100.00%
The deferred vested benefit shall commence as of the first day of
the month coincident with or next following the date on which the
participant's normal retirement age would be attained if the
participant were to continue in employment until such date.
If the lump-sum present value of the vested accrued benefit is not more
than $5,000, the benefit shall automatically be paid in a lump sum.

employer at a time when not vested in any portion of the accrued

FWD:125
any term or provision of the plan by the plan administrator or any action
of the plan administrator taken in good faith shall, upon the Council's

of eligibility for benefits under the plan. Further, the plan
administrator shall have no power to adopt, amend or terminate
the plan, to select or appoint any trustee or to determine or require
any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to the Council.

who may, but need not, be a Board member and such other agents
as it may deem advisable.

members to execute any document or documents including any
§ 608 SAINT MARYS CODE § 608
FWD:126
application, request, certificate, notice, consent, waiver or
direction and shall notify the Council, in writing, of the name or
names of the member or members so authorized. In the absence of
a designation, the chairman shall be deemed to be so authorized.
Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall accept
and be fully protected in relying upon any document executed
by the designated member or members (or the chairman in the
absence of a designation) as representing a valid action by the
Board until the Board shall file with such fiduciary a written
revocation of such designation.
D. The Board or its delegate shall maintain and keep such records as
are necessary for the efficient operation of the plan or as may be
required by any applicable law, regulation or ruling and shall
provide for the preparation and filing of such forms or reports as

department and with the participants and/or other persons entitled
to benefits under the plan.

of the Board, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants, counsel,
actuaries and other specialists and other costs of administering the
plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon approval by the Council
to the extent permitted under applicable law and not otherwise paid by
the employer.
6. Hold Harmless. No member of the Council, the plan administrator, the
Board, the enrolled actuary nor any other person involved in the
administration of the plan shall be liable to any person on account of
any act or failure to act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith in performing their respective duties under the terms of this plan.
To the extent permitted by law, the City of St. Marys shall, and hereby
does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless each present member of
the Board and each successor and each of any such member's heirs,
executors and administrators, and the Board's delegates and
appointees (other than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is
independent of the City of St. Marys and which renders services to the
plan for a fee) from any and all liability and expenses, including counsel
fees, reasonably incurred in any action, suit or proceeding to which he
is or may be made a party by reason of being or having been a member,
delegate or appointee of the Board, except in matters involving criminal
liability, intentional or willful misconduct. If the City of St. Marys
purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature described above, then
there shall be no right of indemnification except to the extent of any
deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the extent of the
amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
7. Approval of Benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
§ 608 FOREWORD § 608
FWD:127
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under
the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits
shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
8. Appeal Procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant"), shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
A. Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
B. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the plan administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
matter calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth:
(1) The specific plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(2) An explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(3) An explanation of the review procedure.
C. Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by the Council of the
initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Council within 60 days of receipt of such notice of
denial. During such review, the claimant or a duly authorized
representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The
Council shall, within 60 days after the receipt of the notice
requesting such review (or in special circumstances, such as where
the Council in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of
receipt of such notice), submit its decision in writing to the person
or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent plan provisions on
which the decision is based.

status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
E. A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.

plan and, to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the
expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.

exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the
contributions to the trust required under the plan. The employer

only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
D. The pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer
under the plan, including contributions made pursuant to the
provisions hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds
thereof. The pension fund shall be held, managed and administered
pursuant to the terms of the plan. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in the plan, the employer has exclusive authority and
discretion to manage and control the pension fund assets. The
employer may, however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or
investment manager, at its sole discretion.
2. Powers and Duties of Employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition
to those vested in it elsewhere in the plan or by law, unless such duties
are delegated.
A. To retain in cash so much of the pension fund as it deems advisable
and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial

§ 608 FOREWORD § 609
FWD:129
to serve as trustee hereunder), without liability for interest
thereon.
B. To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and

C. To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for
cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate, to

exchange thereof.
D. To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,

mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation
pursuant to any such plan.

property held in the fund.
F. To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the
fund and in connection therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or

as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own
commercial bank.
H. In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all
of the powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.
I. To maintain and invest the assets of this plan on a collective and
commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans

respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
J. To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such
a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the plan
§ 609 SAINT MARYS CODE § 609
FWD:130
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject
to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan,
to the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the plan.
K. To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the plan, provided that if a trustee is
appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
L. To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the plan.
M. To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without

any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to
the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to
the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to
pay, to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against
or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or any matter or thing connected therewith.
O. To appoint any persons or firms (including, but not limited to,
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other

upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission take by
it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
P. To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including power to acquire and dispose of) all or
any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons or
firms is registered as an investment advisor under the Investment
Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that Act), or is an
insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose of
pension trust assets under the law of more than one state; in such
event, the employer shall follow the directions of such investment
§ 609 FOREWORD § 609
FWD:131
§ 610. Amendment. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002, Art. X]
manager or managers with respect to the acquisition and
disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it
be under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund
assets which are subject to the management of such investment
manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the employer.
3. Common Investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest
contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common
investments.
4. Compensation and Expenses; Appointed Trustee. The Board may select
a trustee. If a trustee is appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such
reasonable compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by
the employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited
by law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out his functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse
themselves for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
5. Periodic Accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
6. Value of the Pension Fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers
and other experts, and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
1. Right to Amend.
§ 609 SAINT MARYS CODE § 610
FWD:132
§ 611. Plan Termination. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002, Art. XI]
A. The employer shall have the right to amend the plan, at any time,
by adoption of the appropriate resolution or ordinance and with
respect to any provisions thereof, and all parties thereto or
claiming any interest thereunder shall be bound thereby, provided,
however, that no amendment shall revise the accrued benefit of a
participant determined as of the later of the date such amendment
is adopted or the date such amendment becomes effective, if such
revised vested accrued benefit is less than that computed under the
plan without regard to such amendment.
B. No amendment to the pension plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 612, Subsection 3, of this Part has been prepared and presented
to the employer in accordance with the Act.
1. Right to Terminate. It is the present intention of the employer to
maintain the plan indefinitely. Nevertheless the employer reserves the
right, at any time, to permanently discontinue further contributions to
the plan or to terminate the entire plan consistent with the provisions of
applicable law.
2. Distribution upon Termination.
A. In the event of the termination or partial termination of the plan, all
amounts of benefits accrued by the affected participants to the date
of such termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall
immediately become fully vested and nonforfeitable. In the event of
termination of the plan, the employer shall direct either:
(1) That the accrued benefits of participants in the plan continue
to be held in the pension fund in accordance with the
provisions of the plan (other than those provisions related to
forfeitures) without regard to such termination until all funds
have been distributed in accordance with such provisions; or
(2) That distribution be made to each participant in an amount
equal to his accrued benefit as of such date in the form of a
lump sum, or such other form as may be approved by the
employer
B. If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan termination, priority
shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to
participant contributions before assets are applied to the
distribution of vested benefits attributable to other sources
hereunder.
3. Residual Assets. If all liabilities under the plan to participants and
others entitled to receive a benefit have been satisfied, and there
remain any residual assets in the pension fund, the residual assets shall

§ 612. Provisions to Comply with the Municipal Pension Plan
Funding Standard and Recovery Act of 1984. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002,
Art. XII]
be returned to the employer insofar as such return does not contravene
any provision of law, and any remaining balance in excess of employer
contributions, shall be returned to the Commonwealth.
1. Actuarial Valuations.
A. The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least
biennially unless the employer is applying or has applied for
supplemental state assistance pursuant to § 603 of the Act,
whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
B. Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the
beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered
calendar year, beginning with the year 1985.
C. Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by an
approved actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
D. The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act or
any other expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act
and which are directly associated with administering the plan shall
be an allowable administrative expense payable from the assets of
the pension fund. Such allowable expenses shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
(1) Investment costs associated with obtaining authorized
investments and investment management fees.
(2) Accounting expenses.
(3) Premiums for insurance coverage on fund assets.
(4) Reasonable and necessary counsel fees incurred for advice or
to defend the fund.
(5) Legitimate travel and education expense for pension plan
officials; provided, however, that the municipal officials of the
employer, in their fiduciary role, shall monitor the services
provided to the plan to ensure that the expenses are necessary,
reasonable and benefit the pension plan and further provided,
that the plan administrator shall document all expenses item
by item, and where necessary, hour by hour.
2. Reporting Requirements.
A. Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the chief administrative officer of the municipality:
§ 611 SAINT MARYS CODE § 612
FWD:134
§ 613. Miscellaneous. [Ord. 151, 1/21/2002, Art. XIII]
B. The chief administrative officer of the pension plan shall determine
the financial requirements of the pension plan on the basis of the
most recent actuarial report and shall determine the minimum
municipal obligation of the employer with respect to funding the
plan for any given plan year. The chief administrative officer shall
submit the financial requirements of the plan and the minimum
municipal obligation of the employer to the governing body of the
employer annually and shall certify the accuracy of such
calculations and their conformance with the Act.
3. Benefit Modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the chief administrative officer of the plan
shall provide to the employer a cost estimate of the proposed benefit
plan modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved
actuary, which estimate shall disclose to the employer the impact of the
proposed benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements
of the plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the
employer with respect to the plan.
1. Incapacity of Participant. If any participant shall be physically or
mentally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
payment of pension benefits hereunder the employer, upon the receipt
of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so incapacitated and
that another person or institution is maintaining him and that no
guardian or board has been appointed for him, may provide for such
payment of pension benefits hereunder to such person or institution so
maintaining him, and any such payments so made shall be deemed for
every purpose to have been made to such participant.
2. Benefits for a Deceased Participant. If any benefit shall be payable
under the plan to or on behalf of a participant who has died, if the plan
provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the
participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant's estate
is pending in the court of proper jurisdiction, then the employer, at its
sole option, may pay such benefits to the surviving spouse of such
deceased participant, or, if there be no such surviving spouse, to such
participant's then living issue, per stripes; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall prevent the employer from insisting
upon the commencement of estate administration proceedings and the
delivery of any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or
administrator.
3. Liability of Officers of the Employer. Subject to the provisions of the Act,
no past, present or future officer of the employer shall be personally
liable to any participant beneficiary or other person under any provision
of the plan, or any policy issued pursuant thereto.
4. Assets in Pension Fund not Property of Individual Participants. Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to give any participant or beneficiary
§ 612 FOREWORD § 613
FWD:135
§ 614. Applicable Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. [Ord.
213, 11/7/2005, Art. XIV; as amended by Ord. 247, 12/15/2008]
any interest in any specific property of the pension fund or any right
except to receive such distributions as are expressly provided for in this
plan.
5. Employment Rights not Affected by the Plan. Participation in this plan
shall not give any right to any employee to be retained in the employ of
the employer nor shall it interfere with the right of the employer to
discharge any employee and to deal with him without regard to the
effect that such treatment might have upon him as a participant in this
plan.
6. Pension Fund for Sole Benefit of Participants. The income and principal
of the pension fund are for the sole use and benefit of the participants of
this plan, and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be free, clear and
discharged of and from and are not to be in any way liable for debts,
contracts or agreements, now contracted or which may hereafter be
contracted, and from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred
by any participant or beneficiary.
7. Meaning of Certain Words. As used herein, the masculine gender shall
include the feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural in
all cases where such meaning would be appropriate. Headings of
articles and sections are inserted only for convenience of reference and
are not to be considered in the construction of the plan.
8. Information to be Furnished by the Employer. The employer shall
furnish to the plan administrator (and where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer's possession as the plan administrator and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
this plan.
9. Spendthrift. To the extent permitted by law, no payments to any person
under any contract, nor the right to receive such payments, nor any
interest in this plan and pension fund, shall be subject to assignment,
alienation, transfer or anticipation, either by voluntary or involuntary
act of any participant or beneficiary or by operation of law, nor shall
such payment right or interest be subject to the demand or claims of
any such person's debts,' obligations or liabilities.

any inconsistent provisions of the Plan.

2008. The limit is automatically adjusted periodically, without formal
amendment, for changes in the law and cost-of-living adjustments
under Code § 401(a)(17).
5. Maximum Annual Benefit.
A. General Rule. Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code § 415 and the regulations
thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein
by reference. If a benefit payable to a participant under this Plan
would otherwise exceed the limit under Code § 415, the benefit will
be reduced to the maximum permissible benefit.
B. Effective Date. If there is more than one permissible effective date
for any required change in the Code § 415(b) provisions, then the
change shall be effective as of the latest permissible effective date;
however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under Code
§ 415(b)(1)(A), whether required or permissible, shall take effect
automatically as of the earliest permissible effective date. The
"applicable mortality table" in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 became effective
as of December 31, 2002, and remained effective through
December 31, 2007. The "applicable mortality table" and
"applicable interest rate" after December 31, 2007, is found in Rev.
Rul. 2007-67.
C. No Reduction in Accrued Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, no
change in the limits under this section shall reduce the benefit of
any participant.
D. Multiple Plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(b) or (e), and
if the aggregated benefits would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code § 415(b) or (e), then benefits shall be reduced first under this
Plan. [Historical Note: Code § 415(e) applied for limitation years
beginning prior to 2000.]
§ 614 FOREWORD § 614
FWD:137
E. Mandatory Contributions. Participant contributions are annual
additions, and any benefit attributable to participant contributions
is not included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code § 415(b)
or (e). This subsection does not apply to contributions "picked-up"
in accordance with Code § 414(h).
F. Permissive Service Credit. Effective as of January 1, 1998, if a
participant makes a purchase of permissive service credit [within
the meaning of Code § 415(n)] under the Plan, the benefit derived
from the contributions made to purchase the service credit shall be
treated as part of the benefit subject to the limitations under this
section.
6. Limit on Annual Additions.
A. Annual Additions. Except as otherwise provided, annual additions
(which include participant contributions) under this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code § 415(c) and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. If an annual addition would
otherwise exceed the limit under Code § 415(c), the excess annual
addition will be eliminated in accordance with methods permitted
under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to 2009), or its
successor.
B. Multiple Plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(c), and if the
annual additions would otherwise exceed the limit under Code
§ 415(c), annual additions will first be reduced under the other
plan. If there is more than one other plan, annual additions will first
be reduced under the plan with the greatest amount of annual
additions.
C. Effective Date. The limits under which Code § 415(c) are adjusted
periodically in accordance with changes in the law or cost-of-living
adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If there is
more than one permissible effective date for any required change
relating to Code § 415(c), then the change shall be effective as of
the earliest permissible effective date.
D. Section 415(c) Compensation. For the purposes of this Section,
"compensation" includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(b)1 or (2) and excludes all items listed in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(c), the terms of which are specifically incorporated
herein by reference. Effective as of January 1, 2009, to the extent
required by the Heroes Earnings Assistance Tax Relief Tax Act of
2008 (HEART Act), differential wage payments shall be included in
compensation. [Added by Ord. 276, 10/1/2012]
7. Direct Rollovers.
§ 614 SAINT MARYS CODE § 614
FWD:138
A. Effective as of January 1, 1993, if a participant, a spousal
beneficiary, or an alternate payee (who is a spouse or former
spouse of a participant) is entitled (under other provisions of this
Plan) to receive an "eligible rollover distribution" of at least $200,
the distributee may elect that the Plan Administrator transfer all or
part (provided that the part is at least $500 to any "eligible
retirement plan" capable of accepting such a transfer.
B. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION  Any distribution of
all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: (i)
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); (iii) the portion
of any distribution that is not includible in gross income
(determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
appreciation with respect to employer securities); and (iv)
effective as of January 1, 2002, any hardship distribution.
Effective as of January 1, 2002, Clause (iii) does not apply to
any after-tax participant contributions that are paid to an
individual retirement account or annuity described in Code
§ 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan
described in Code § 401(a) or 403(a), or effective as of January
1, 2007, any 403(b) annuity contract that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is
includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution
which is not so includible.
(2) ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN  An individual retirement
account described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement
annuity described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described
in Code § 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code
§ 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover
distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover
distribution to a surviving spouse, prior to January 1, 2002, an
eligible retirement plan was an individual retirement account
or individual retirement annuity. Effective as of January 1,
2002, an "eligible retirement plan" includes an annuity
contract described in Code § 403(b) and an eligible plan under
Code § 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political
subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a
state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to
separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
§ 614 FOREWORD § 614
FWD:139
from this Plan. Effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA is an
"eligible retirement plan."
(3) DISTRIBUTEE  Includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code § 414(p)(11), are
distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse.
(4) Effective as of January 1, 2002, an employee may, in
accordance with Code § 457(e)(17), make a trustee-to-trustee
transfer from an eligible deferred compensation plan [as
defined in Code § 457(b)] to this Plan for the purpose of
purchasing service credit (to the extent that such purchases
are permitted under the terms of the Plan) or repaying a cashout
of contributions refunded under the Plan.
8. Minimum Required Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Plan to the contrary, the distribution of a participant's benefits shall be
made in accordance with the requirements and conditions of and shall
otherwise comply with Code § 401(a)(9). For purposes of complying
with Code § 401(a)(9), life expectancies shall be determined in
accordance with the 1987 proposed regulations prior to January 1,
2003, and with the final regulations [§ 1.401(a)(9)-1 through
§ 1.401(a)(9)-9] on or after January 1, 2003.
A. Distribution.
(1) Effective as of January 1, 1997, distribution of a participant's
benefits shall begin not later than April 1 of the calendar year
following the later of:
(a) The calendar year in which the participant attains age
70 1/2; or
(b) The calendar year in which the participant retires.
(2) Distributions must be made over a period not exceeding the life
of the participant or the joint lives of a participant and his
beneficiary.
B. Distributions to a participant and his beneficiaries shall only be
made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements
of Code § 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder.
C. This section does not authorize the payment of any benefit in any
form not permitted under another provision of the Plan.
9. Qualified Domestic Relations Orders. All rights and benefits, including
elections, provided to a participant in this Plan shall be subject to the
rights afforded to any "alternate payee" under what is recognized
§ 614 SAINT MARYS CODE § 614
FWD:140
pursuant to state law support provisions as a "qualified domestic
relations order."
10. Vesting Upon Plan Termination. Upon the termination of this Plan, or
complete discontinuance of contributions [within the meaning of pre-
ERISA Code § 401(a)(7)] to this Plan, each employee, as of the date of
such termination or discontinuance, shall become vested to the extent
that the Plan is funded.
11. Consent for Lump-Sum Distributions. Effective January 1, 2006,
notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any distribution to a
participant made prior to the earlier of age 62 or normal retirement age
of an amount in excess of $1,000 that is an eligible rollover distribution
as set forth in the Plan and the Code shall be made only upon consent of
the participant.
12. Heroes Earnings Assistance Relief Tax Act (HEART Act). Effective for
deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a participant dies while
performing qualified military service [as defined in IRC § 414(u)], the
survivors of the participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other
than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service)
provided under the Plan had the participant resumed and then
terminated employment on account of death. [Amended by Ord. 276,
10/1/2012]
13. Non-Spouse Beneficiaries. Effective as of January 1, 2007, if a
beneficiary who is not a surviving spouse is entitled to receive what
would otherwise be an "eligible rollover distribution," the beneficiary
may, in accordance with Code § 402(c)(11), make a trustee-to-trustee
transfer of that amount to an IRA or individual retirement annuity
(other than an endowment contract), provided that:
A. The transfer is made not later than the end of the fourth year after
the year of the participant's death; and
B. The account or annuity to which the amount is transferred is
treated as an inherited IRA or individual retirement annuity in
accordance with Code § 408(d)(3)(C).
14. Intent to Comply with Internal Revenue Code. The City intends that this
Plan shall meet all the pertinent requirements established for a
governmental plan [as defined in Internal Revenue Code § 414(d)]
under Internal Revenue Code § 401(a), as amended, and the Plan shall
be interpreted, wherever possible, to comply with the terms of said
code and all formal regulations and rulings pertinent to the Plan.
[Added by Ord. 280, 1/21/2013]
15. A participant shall be 100% vested in his normal retirement benefit
upon attainment of normal retirement age. [Added by Ord. 280, 1/21/

§ 622. Definitions. [Ord. 176, 11/3/2003, Art. I-A; as amended by
Ord. 213, 11/7/2005, Art. XIV]
The following words and phrases as used herein shall have the meanings
set forth in this section, unless a different meaning is plainly required by
the context. Furthermore, the use of the term "he" or "his" shall include the
feminine "she" and "her" and vice versa. It is in the intent of this subpart to
be gender neutral and the previous terms shall be interchangeable.
1. Whereas, the City of St. Marys is a home rule municipality under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As a result of Municipality
of Monroeville v. Monroeville Police Department Wage Policy
Committee, 767 A.2d 596 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001) and the Auditor General's
Municipal Pension Bulletin No. 2001-01, pension benefits for employees
hired on or after January 24, 2001 are subject to the limitations of the
Third Class City Code 53 P.S. § 39340 et seq., This addendum (which
includes this Preamble) to the City of St. Marys Nonuniformed
Employees Pension Plan, is intended to comply with the aforementioned
referenced legal requirements and will become part of the City of St.
Marys Nonuniformed Employees Pension Plan, effective January 24,
2001.
2. Whereas, this addendum to the City of St. Marys Nonuniformed Pension
Plan shall apply to all employees hired on or after January 24, 2001 and
shall be the exclusive document for determining pension benefits for
those employees. The pension benefits of employees hired before
January 24, 2001 shall be determined according to the City of St. Marys
Nonuniformed Pension Plan (exclusive of this addendum). This
addendum will have no effect on the pension benefits of employees
hired before January 24, 2001.
3. Whereas, it is the City's intent that the addendum shall be established
and maintained (1) in accordance with the mandatory benefits required
by the Third Class City Code; and (2) as a qualified plan under § 401(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, as applicable to
governmental plans and this addendum shall be amended as and when
necessary to meet the Internal Revenue Code provisions applicable to
governmental plans and shall be construed, clarified and amended as
necessary to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Third Class
City Code.
4. Now, therefore, the plan now known as the "City of St. Marys
Nonuniformed Employee's Pension Plan" is hereby amended by this
preamble and as follows:
§ 621 FOREWORD § 622

any given time is serving as actuary; provided, that such actuary must be an

As of any given computation date, a participant's monthly normal
retirement benefit determined in accordance with § 625, Subsection 1,
of this Subpart, which amount shall be based upon the participant's
final monthly average compensation and projected credited service if
the participant were to continue in employment until attainment of
normal retirement age and which will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the participant's actual credited service

as required by the plan administrator authorizing payroll deduction
of such contributions. No employee shall be eligible to participate

participation requirements.
5. Leave of Absence. During any leave of absence that is not an authorized
leave of absence, a participant shall be deemed an inactive participant
and shall not be given credit for years of service for vesting, nor shall
any benefits accrue hereunder. If the employee is not reemployed by the
expiration of the leave of absence, participation in the plan shall cease

participant who is on an authorized leave of absence, the obligation
to contribute hereunder shall be waived during the period of such
authorized leave of absence.
B. Contributions by Former Participants. Should any former
participant, after 20 years of service, be dismissed, voluntarily
retired or be in any manner deprived of his or her position or
employment, before attaining the age if 60 years, upon continuing

separation from employment, but said pension shall not commence
until he or she has attained the age of 60 years.
2. Employer Contributions. The employer shall contribute to the plan the
amount determined by the plan's actuary and certified by the Chief
Administrative Officer as the amount which is necessary to adequately
fund the benefits hereunder in accordance with the requirements of the
Act, as provided in § 633 of this Subpart.
3. Gifts. To the extent permitted by law, the plan administrator may accept
gifts, outright or in trust, for deposit into the pension fund. The
application of such gifts shall be governed by the rules of the plan and
such directions prescribed by the donor as are not inconsistent with the
rules of the plan and applicable law. Such gifts shall be applied in the
same manner as state aid contributions.
4. No Reversion to the Employer. At no time shall it be possible for the
plan assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if
the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution
is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the
contribution, the plan is terminated, as provided in § 632 of this
Subpart or as otherwise permitted by the laws of this Commonwealth.
1. Normal Retirement.
A. Normal Retirement. A participant who retires upon attainment of
normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a monthly
retirement benefit in an amount equal to 50% of the participant's
final monthly average compensation reduced pursuant to
Subsection 1B below.
§ 624 FOREWORD § 625
FWD:149
B. Reduction for Social Security Benefit. Because the City has entered
into an agreement with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
place employees eligible for benefits under this addendum under
the federal Social Security Act, the pension to be to participants
pursuant to this section, after the age and upon that portion of final
monthly average compensation on which Social Security benefits
are payable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to 40% of the
primary insurance amount of Social Security paid or payable to the
participant. Such reduction shall be subject to the following
provisions:
(1) Upon attainment of the age at which Social Security benefits
are payable of the age at which Social Security benefits are
payable by a beneficiary receiving a pension or upon
retirement of a participant after attaining that age, his
eligibility to the old age insurance benefit and the primary
insurance amount of Social Security upon which the reduction
in the pension shall be based, shall be computed in the manner
specified in the Federal Social Security Act, except that in
determining such eligibility and such amount only wages or
compensation for services performed in the employ of the City
shall be included.
(2) The reduction shall not apply to a pension for total and
permanent disability payable under this section.
(3) Whenever the amount of the reduction from the pension shall
have been once determined, it shall remain fixed for the
duration of the pension, except that any decrease in the
primary insurance amount under the Social Security Act shall
result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of the
reduction from the pension.
(4) The total sum, including Social Security benefits, to be
received upon retirement by a participant shall not be less than
the pension that would be paid by the plan in the absence of
the participant's participation in the Social Security system.
2. Former Participant Retirement. A former participant who has satisfied
all of the conditions set for the in § 624, Subsection 1B, shall be entitled
to the normal retirement benefit set forth in Subsection 1A above, upon
attaining the age of 60 years.
3. Late Retirement. A participant who retires after the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date on which normal
retirement age has been attained shall receive a retirement benefit
pursuant to Subsection 1A above in an amount equal to the amount
calculated as of the date on which actual retirement occurs.
4. Disability Benefit. A participant who has satisfied the definition of
disability as set forth in § 622 after he has completed 10 years of
credited service will be entitled to a disability pension equal to the
§ 625 SAINT MARYS CODE § 625
FWD:150
normal retirement benefit set forth in Subsection 1A above. The
disability pension shall continue until death or recovery from disability
prior to normal retirement age. In the event a disabled employee
recovers from disability and returns to the service of the City, his
subsequent retirement pension shall be based on service rendered prior
to disability plus service rendered after recovery from disability.
5. Application for Benefit. A participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit on a form and in the manner prescribed by the
plan administrator and deliver the said application to the plan
administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit
payments are to commence. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments or any other
benefits shall be due or payable on or before the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the date that is 30 days after the date
the plan administrator receives the application for benefits.
6. Nonduplication of Benefit. A participant who shall be receiving a
monthly retirement benefit under this addendum and who shall resume
employment as an employee, shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Such benefit payments shall be
adjusted to reflect any previous pension payments received and any
additional service or change in compensation.
7. Cessation of Benefit Payments. Any pension benefit payable hereunder
shall be payable through and including the later of the month in which
such participant's death occurs. Any survivor annuity payable on or
after the participant's death shall be paid through the month in which
such surviving annuitant's death occurs.
8. Maximum Benefit Limitations.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this addendum, no benefit
provided under this addendum attributable to contributions of the
City shall exceed, as an annual amount, $90,000, assuming a single
life annuity or qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined for
purposes of Code § 415), subject to cost-of-living adjustments made
from time to time by plan amendments or automatically in
accordance with and in such amounts as are prescribed in or
pursuant to regulations promulgated under Code § 415(d) (which
adjustments shall not become effective prior to January 1 of the
year for which such adjustment is made) and the rate of benefit
accrual shall be frozen or reduced accordingly, subject to the
provisions of Subsection 8B below.
B. The limitation provided in Subsection 8A above shall be subject to
the following conditions:
(1) For purposes of the above limitation, if the benefit under this
addendum is payable in any form other than in the forms
described therein (without regard to ancillary benefits) or if
§ 625 FOREWORD § 625
FWD:151
the employees contribute to the pension fund or make rollover
contributions, the determination as to whether the limitation
has been satisfied shall be made by adjusting the benefit so
that it is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit described in
Subsection 8A. For the purpose of making the adjustment in
the form of the benefit to an actuarial equivalent, the interest
rate shall not be less than the greater of 5% or the rate
specified under this addendum's definition of "actuarial
equivalent."
(2) If retirement income benefits commence prior to a
participant's attainment of age 62, the limitation contained in
Subsection 8A above shall be adjusted to the actuarial
equivalent of a $90,000 annual benefit commencing at age 62.
The reduction under this paragraph shall not reduce the
limitation of Subsection 8A below $75,000 if the benefit begins
at or after 55, or, if the benefit begins before age 55, the
amount which is the equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for
age 55. For the purpose of making this adjustment, the interest
rate used shall not be less than the greater of 5% or the rate
specified in the plan's definition of "actuarial equivalent." The
above adjustment shall not apply with respect to disability or
survivor benefits under this addendum.
(3) If retirement income benefits commence after the participant's
attainment of age 65, the limitation described in Subsection 8A
above shall be adjusted so that such limitation (as so
increased) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such
retirement income benefit begins) which is the actuarial
equivalent of a $90,000 annual benefit commencing at age 65.
For the purpose of making this adjustment, the interest rate
assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5% or the
rate specified in this addendum's definition of "actuarial
equivalent."
(4) Benefits payable to a participant under this section shall be
deemed not to exceed the limitation imposed by Subsection 8A
if the annual benefit payable to such participant does not
exceed $10,000 (for this year or any prior year), provided such
participant has never participated in a defined contribution
plan maintained by the employer.
(5) In the event a participant (other than a participant receiving
disability benefits under the addendum) has less than 10 years
of credited service, the limitations described in Subsections 8A
and 8B(2) of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years of credited service
credited to the participant and the denominator of which is 10.
(6) For purposes of applying the limitations of this section, all
defined benefit plans of the employer shall be treated as one
§ 625 SAINT MARYS CODE § 625
FWD:152
defined benefit plan, and all defined contributions plans shall
be treated as one defined contribution plan.
(7) For purposes of the above limitations, the limitation year shall
be the plan year, unless such period is otherwise defined in a
written resolution adopted by the employer.
9. Incorporation of Code § 415 by Reference. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this section to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments
and other requirements prescribed in this section shall at all times
comply with the provisions of Code § 415 and the regulations
thereunder (as such apply to governmental plans), the terms of which
are specifically incorporated herein by reference.
10. Qualified Domestic Reactions Order Distribution. All rights and
benefits, including elections, provided to a participant in this plan shall
be subject to the rights afforded to any alternate payee pursuant to a
domestic relations order as provided by applicable state law. In
evaluating any such domestic relations order, Code § 414(p) may be
used as a guide.
11. Direct Rollover.
A. Notwithstanding any provisions of this addendum to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an
eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement
plan specified by distributee in a direct rollover.
B. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except
that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); and the
portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
(2) An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account
described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity
described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code
§ 403(a) or a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a) that
accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the
§ 625 FOREWORD § 625
FWD:153
§ 626. Payment of Benefits. [Ord. 176, 11/3/2003, Art. V-A]
surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual
retirement account or individual retirement annuity.
(3) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code § 414(p), are
distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse.
(4) A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
C. Effective Date. This section shall apply to distributions made after
December 31, 2001.
(1) Modification of Definition of Eligible Retirement Plan. For
purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Subsection 11
above, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity
contract described in § 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan
under § 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state or any agency or instrumentality
of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to
separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
from this plan. The definition of "eligible retirement plan" shall
also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or
to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under
a qualified domestic relation order, as defined in § 414(p) of the
Code.
(2) Modification of Definition of Eligible Rollover Distribution to
Include After-Tax Employee Contributions. For purposes of the
direct rollover provisions in Subsection 11 above, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution
merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions which are not includable in gross income.
However, such portion may be paid only to an individual
retirement account or annuity described in § 408(a) or (b) of
the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described
in § 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is not so
includable.
12. Credit for Qualified Military Service. Notwithstanding any provision of
this addendum to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service
credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in
accordance with § 414(u) of the Code.
§ 625 SAINT MARYS CODE § 626
FWD:154
1. "Normal form" shall mean for the payment of a normal retirement
benefit, a late retirement benefit or a disability retirement benefit as
follows:
A. A monthly annuity for the life of the participant.
B. For those participants who die without entitlement to a retirement
benefit, there shall be paid to the beneficiary the accumulated
contributions account. In the event no beneficiary designation is on
file at the time of the death of the participant, the payment shall be
made in the following order:
(1) Spouse;
(2) Living children; and
(3) The estate of the deceased.
2. Commencement Benefits. A participant may elect to commence
receiving distribution of retirement benefits as of the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date on which retirement
occurs with an eligibility to receive benefits.

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this addendum, the entire
benefit of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to
his death shall be distributed either:
(1) Not later than the required beginning date.
(2) Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the
lives of such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a
period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
participant, or the joint life expectancies of such participant
and a designated beneficiary).
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this
addendum dies prior to the date when his entire interest has
been distributed to him after distribution of his benefits has
begun in accordance with Subsection 2 above, the remaining
portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly
as under the method of distribution being used under
Subsection 2 above as of the date of his death.
B. If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this addendum dies
before distribution of his benefit has begun the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
§ 626 FOREWORD § 626
FWD:155
§ 627. Termination of Employment. [Ord. 176, 11/3/2003, Art. VI-A]
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the
five year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2 and, further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin, this subsection shall be applied
as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
C. For purposes of this section, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(1) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2, or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
(2) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its
rules.
(3) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
(4) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than
annually.
4. Personal Right of Participant. Each participant's right to receive any
benefits hereunder is personal and expires on such participant's death.
No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee or other person claiming
by or through a participant shall have any interest in any benefits
hereunder unless clearly and expressly so provided by the terms of this
addendum. A participant's election, failure to file an election hereunder
or revocation of an election shall be final and binding on all persons.
1. Rights of Terminated Employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided, shall be limited to

subsections of this section.
2. Distribution of Accumulated Contributions. A participant whose
employment ceased for any reason before he becomes entitled to a

contributions account. Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions
account, said participant, survivor and his or her beneficiary shall not
be entitled to any further payments from the plan.
3. Forfeiture. A participant who terminates employment with the
employer at a time when not vested in any portion of the accrued
benefit derived from employer contributions shall cease to be a
participant hereunder and shall not be entitled to any benefits under
this addendum derived from not vested employer contributions.

average salary as of the date of determination and multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the participant's or new plan participant's

(1) The new plan participant must file with the plan administrator
a written notice of his or her intention to vest.
(2) The new plan participant must include in the notice the date
the member intends to terminate his or her service as a fulltime
police officer.
(3) The termination date shall be at least 30 days later than the
date of notice to vest.
(4) The new plan participant must be in good standing with the
police department on the date of notice to vest.
(5) The administrator shall indicate on the notice to vest the final
monthly average salary of the new plan participant as of the
date of said notice to vest.

C. Upon reaching the date which would have been the new plan
participant's retirement date had he or she continued his or her
full-time employment with the police department, the new plan
participant shall notify the administrator, in writing, that he or she
desires to collect his or her pension. The amount of retirement
benefits he or she is entitled to receive under this Subsection 3
shall be computed as follows:
(1) The initial determination of the base retirement benefits shall
be computed on the final monthly average salary indicated on
the notice to vest.
(2) The portion of the base retirement benefits due shall be
determined by applying to the base amount the percentage
that his or her years of service actually rendered bears to the
years of service which would have been rendered had the
member continued to be employed by the department until his
or her normal retirement age.
1. Plan Administrator. The plan administrator shall be the individual
appointed by Council who shall have the power and authority to do all
acts and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments necessary
to implement and effectuate the purpose of this plan. The plan
administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf to any persons

specification and not limitation and except as specifically limited
hereafter, the plan administrator is authorized:
A. To construe this plan.
B. To determine all questions affecting the eligibility of any employee
to participate herein.
C. To compute the amount and source of any benefit payable
hereunder to any participant, new plan participant or beneficiary.

plan participant and/or other person in filing any application or
election.
F. To prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required by
law or as the plan administrator deems appropriate, information
explaining the plan.
G. To require from the employer, any participant or any new plan
participant such information as shall be necessary for the proper
administration of the plan.
H. To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the administration

other specialists and other costs of administering the plan, may be paid
from the pension fund upon approval by Council to the extent permitted
under applicable law and not otherwise paid by the employer.
4. Hold Harmless. No member of Council, the plan administrator, the
enrolled actuary, plan counsel nor any other person involved in the
administration of the plan shall be liable to any person on account of
any act or failure to act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith in performing their respective duties under the terms of this plan.
To the extent permitted by law, the employer shall, and hereby does
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the plan administrator and each
successor and each of any heirs, executors and administrators, from
any and all liability and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably
incurred in any action suit or proceeding to which he is or may be made
a party by reason of being or having been the plan administrator, except
in matters involving criminal liability, intentional or willful misconduct.
If the employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature
described above, then there shall be no right of indemnification except
to the extent of any deductible amount under the insurance coverage or
to the extent of the amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
5. Approval of Benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under
the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits
shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
6. Appeal Procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant"), shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
§ 808 SAINT MARYS CODE § 808
FWD:176
A. Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall full describe the nature of the claim. The
plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
B. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the plan administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth:
(1) The specific plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(2) A explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(3) An explanation of the review procedure.
C. Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by Council of the initial
determination. Such request for review must be made by notice to
Council within 60 days of receipt of such notice of denial. During
such review, the claimant or a duly authorized representative shall
have the right to review any pertinent documents and to submit any
issues or comments in writing. Council shall, within 60 days after
receipt of the notice requesting such review, (or in special
circumstances, such as where Council in its sole discretion holds a
hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice) submit its
decision in writing to the person or persons whose claim has been
denied. The decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all
parties, shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by
the claimant and shall contain specific references to the pertinent
plan provisions on which the decision is based.
D. Any notice of claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
E. A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
7. Police Pension Plan Committee. Council shall appoint a police pension
plan committee to advise and consult with the plan administrator with
§ 808 FOREWORD § 808
FWD:177
§ 809. Applicable Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. [Ord.
152, 1/21/2002, Art. IX]
regard to the affairs and operations of the plan, two of which shall
be active police officers of the City. One of the police representatives
shall have full voting rights and one police representative shall serve
in an ad hoc capacity until such time as the home rule charter is
amended to allow a second member of the police to be added with full
voting rights. The committee shall consist of no more than five voting
members appointed by Council. Each member of the committee shall
serve in that capacity until the earlier of resignation, death, removal or
otherwise. Each member may be remove at any time, with or without
cause, by Council. Each member may resign by delivering written
notice to Council and other members of the committee. Vacancies on
the committee shall be filled by the Council.
1. Explanation. In recognition of the fact that the plan must comply in
form, content and operation with certain provisions of he Code, and in
spite of the limited applicability of such provisions to the normal
operation of the plan, the following subsections of this section detail the
limitations and parameters applicable to maintaining favorable tax
treatment of funds contributed to the plan under federal law.
2. Definitions. The following words and phrases are hereby introduced
and defined for purposes of this section only:
ACCRUED BENEFIT  A participant's retirement benefit exclusive of
vesting.
ACTURIAL EQUIVALENT  A form of benefit differing in time, period
or manner of payment from a specific benefit provided under the plan,
but having the same value when computed using the UP 1984 Table
with interest computed at 7%. Effective January 1, 1995, for purposes
of § 415 of the Code, effective the first limitation year beginning after
December 31, 1994, the applicable mortality table shall be used for the
mortality table. This applies to all benefits including benefits accrued
before the first limitation year beginning after December 31, 1994. The
applicable mortality table is the mortality table described in Revenue
Ruling 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80.
ANNUAL ADDITIONS  The sum credited to a participant's account
for any limitation year of (i) employer contributions, (ii) employee
contributions, (iii) forfeitures, (iv) amounts allocated after March 31,
1984, to an individual medical account, as defined in Code § 415(1)(2)
which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the employer,
and (v) amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after
December 31, 1985, in taxable years ending after such date, which
are attributable to postretirement medical benefits allocated to the
separate account of a key employee (as defined in Code § 419A(d)(3)
under a welfare benefit plan [as defined under Code § 419(e)]
maintained by the employer. Except, however, the percentage limitation
referred to in Code § 415(c)(1)(B) shall not apply to: (i) any contribution
§ 808 SAINT MARYS CODE § 809
FWD:178
for medical benefits [within the meaning of Code § 419A(f)(2)] after
separation from service which is otherwise treated as an annual
addition, or (ii) any amount otherwise treated as an annual addition
under Code § 415(1)(1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for limitation
years beginning prior to January 1, 1987, only that portion of employee
contributions equal to the lesser of employee contributions in excess
of 6% of "415 Compensation" or 1/2 of employee contributions shall
be considered an annual addition. For years beginning after December
31, 2001, annual additions shall be calculated in conformance with the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.
ANNUAL BENEFIT 
The benefit payable under the terms of the plan (exclusive of any
benefit not required to be considered for purposes of applying the
limitations of Code § 415 to the plan) payable in the form of a
straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits. If the benefit under
the plan is payable in any other form, the annual benefit shall
be adjusted to the equivalent of a straight life annuity using the
greater of the interest rate assumption specified in the definition of
actuarial equivalent or five percent.
A.
In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and
notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary,
for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, the annual
compensation of each employee who becomes a participant in the
plan on or after such date shall not exceed the OBRA '93 annual
compensation limit. The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is
$150,000, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the
cost of living in accordance with Code § 401(a)(17)(B). The cost-ofliving
adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period,
not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined
(determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a
determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the OBRA
'93 annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of months in the determination
period, and the denominator of which is 12.
B.
For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, and any
reference in this plan to the limitation under Code § 401(a)(17)
shall mean the § 401(a)(17) limit as adjusted by law.
C.
With respect only to an employee who becomes a participant in
the plan on or after January 1, 1996, if compensation for any
prior determination period is taken into account in determining
such employee's benefits accruing in the current plan year, the
compensation for that prior determination period is subject to
the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit in effect for that prior
determination period. For this purpose, for determination periods
beginning before the first day of the first plan year beginning on or
D.
§ 809 FOREWORD § 809
FWD:179
EMPLOYEE  Any person who is employed by the employer, but
excludes any person who is an independent contractor. "Employee"
shall include leased employees within the meaning of Code
§§ 4141(n)(2) and 414(o)(2) unless such leased employees are covered
by a plan described in Code § 414(n)(5) and such leased employees
do not constitute more than 20% of the recipient's non-highlycompensated
work force.
415 COMPENSATION  With respect to any participant, such
participant's wages as defined on Code § 3401(a) and all other
payments of compensation by the employer (in the course of the
employer's business) for a plan year for which the employer is required
to furnish the participant with a written statement under Code
§§ 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052. "415 Compensation" must be
determined without regard to any rules under Code § 3401(a) that limit
the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location
of the employment or the services performed [such as the exception
for agricultural labor in Code § 3401(a)(2)]. Effective for plan years
beginning after December 31, 1997, the term compensation for Code
§ 415 purposes, in accordance with § 415(c)(3)(D) of the Code and
Treasury Regulation § 1.415-2(d), shall include:
LEASED EMPLOYEE  Any person (other than an employee of the
recipient) who pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and
any other person ("leasing organization") has performed services for
the recipient [or for the recipient and related persons determined in
accordance with Code § 414(n)(6)] on a substantially full-time basis
for a period of at least one year, and such services are performed
under primary direction or control of the recipient. Contributions or
benefits provided a leased employee by the leasing organization which
are attributable to services performed for the recipient employer shall
be treated as provided by the recipient employer. A leased employee
shall not be considered an employee of the recipient:
after January 1, 1996, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is
$150,000.
A. An elective deferral [as defined in Code § 402(g)(3)]; and
Any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer
at the election of the employee and which is includable in gross
income of the employee by reason of Code § 125 or 457.
B.
If such employee is covered by a money purchase pension plan
providing:
A nonintegrated employer contribution rate of at least 10%
of compensation, as defined in Code § 415(c)(3), but including
amounts contributed pursuant to a salary reduction agreement
which are excludable from the employee's gross income under
Code § 125, 402(a)(8), 402(h) or 403(b)
(1)
(2) Immediate participation.
A.
§ 809 SAINT MARYS CODE § 809
FWD:180
LIMITATION YEAR  The plan year, for purposes of applying the
limitations under the current section.
PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT  The account established and maintained
by the administrator for each participant with respect to his total
interest in the defined contribution plan maintained by the employer
resulting from annual additions.
PLAN YEAR  The twelve-month period beginning on January 1 and
ending on December 31 of each year.
REGULATION  The income tax regulations, as amended from time to
time, as promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.
(3) Full and immediate vesting.
If leased employees do not constitute more than 20% of the
recipient's non-highly compensated work force.
B.
3. Maximum Annual Benefit.
A. Subject to the exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit
payable to a participant under this plan in any limitation year shall
equal $90,000.
B. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, to the
extent the plan was in existence on May 6, 1986, and had complied
at all times with the requirements of Code § 415 (including any
pertinent elections), the maximum annual benefit for any individual
who was a participant as of the first day of the limitation year
beginning after December 31, 1986, shall not be less than the
current accrued benefit. "Current accrued benefit" shall mean a
participant's accrued benefit under the plan, determined as if the
participant had separated from service as of the close of the last
limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987, when expressed
as an annual benefit within the meaning of Code § 415(b)(2). In
determining the amount of a participant's current accrued benefit,
the following shall be disregarded:
(1) Any change in the terms and conditions of the plan after May 5,
1986; and
(2) Any adjustment for cost of living occurring after May 5, 1986.
C. The dollar limitation under Code § 415(b)(1)(A) stated in
Subsection 3A of this section shall be adjusted annually as provided
in Code § 415(d) pursuant to the regulations thereunder. The
adjusted limitation is effective as of January 1 of each calendar year
and is applicable to limitation years ending with or within that
calendar year.
D. For the purpose of this section, all qualified defined benefit plans
(whether terminated or not) ever maintained by the employer shall
be treated as one defined benefit plan, and all qualified defined
§ 809 FOREWORD § 809
FWD:181
contribution plans (whether terminated or not) ever maintained by
the employer shall be treated as one defined contribution plan.
E. For the purpose of this section, if this plan is a Code § 413(c) plan,
all employers of a participant who maintain this plan will be
considered to be a single employer, namely the employer.
4. Adjustments to Annual Benefit and Limitations.
A. If the annual benefit begins before age 62, then the $90,000
limitation shall be reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent of
the $90,000 limitation beginning at age 62. The $90,000 shall not
be actuarial reduced, however, to less than: (i) $75,000 if the
annual benefit commences on or after age 55; or (ii) the amount
which is the actuarial equivalent of the $75,000 limitation at age 55
if the annual benefit commences prior to age 55. For purposes of
adjusting the $90,000 limitation applicable prior to age 62 or the
$75,000 limitation applicable prior to age 55, the adjustment shall
be made using the parameters specified in the definition of
actuarial equivalent, except that the interest rate assumption shall
be the greater of 5% or the rate specified in said definition and any
mortality decrement shall be ignored to the extent that a forfeiture
does not occur at death. In no event, however, shall the aforesaid
dollar limitation be reduced to an amount less than that required by
the Code. The above adjustment shall not apply with respect to
disability or survivor benefits under the plan.
B. If the annual benefit begins after age 65, the $90,000 limitation
shall be increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the
$90,000 limitation at age 65.
C. For purposes of adjusting the $90,000 limitation applicable after
age 65, the adjustment shall be made using the parameters
specified in the definition of "actuarial equivalent," except that the
interest rate assumption shall be the lesser of 5% or the rate
specified in said definition, and the mortality decrement shall be
ignored to the extent that a forfeiture does not occur at death.
D. For purposes of the annual benefit and Subsections 4A and B of this
section, no adjustments under Code § 415(d) shall be taken into
account before the limitation year for which such adjustment first
takes effect.
E. For purposes of the annual benefit, no adjustment is required for
qualified joint and survivor annuity benefits, preretirement death
benefits, postretirement medical benefits or disability retirement
benefits.
F. To the extent applicable, the above provisions and limitations shall
be governed by Code § 415(b)(2)(F) and Code § 415(b)(2)(G).
§ 809 SAINT MARYS CODE § 809
FWD:182
5. Annual Benefit Not in Excess of $10,000. Subject to the provisions of
any applicable state law, this plan may pay an annual benefit to any
participant in excess of his or her maximum annual benefit if the annual
benefit derived from employer contributions under this plan and all
other defined benefit plans maintained by the employer does not in the
aggregate exceed $10,000 for the limitation year or for any prior
limitation year, and the employer has not at any time maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant participated. For
purposes of this subsection, if this plan provides for voluntary or
mandatory employee contributions, such contributions will not be
considered a separate defined contribution plan maintained by the
employer.
6. Participation or Service Reductions. If a participant (other than a
participant receiving disability benefits under the plan) has less than 10
years of participation in the plan at the time he begins to receive
benefits thereunder and is not receiving a disability retirement benefit,
the limitations in Subsections 3 and 4 of this section shall be reduced by
multiplying such limitations by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of years of participation (or part thereof) in the plan, and the
denominator of which is 10, provided, however, that said faction shall in
no event be less than 1/10. The limitations of Subsection 4 of this
section shall be reduced in the same manner, except the preceding
sentence shall be applied with respect to years of service rather than
years of participation in the plan. Additionally, for plan years beginning
after December 31, 1986, the reductions to the limitations described
above in Subsections 3A and 4 of this section shall be applied
separately with respect to each change in the benefit structure of the
plan.
7. Multiple Plan Reduction.
A. If an employee is (or has been) a participant in one or more defined
benefit plans and one or more defined contribution plans
maintained by the employer, the sum of the defined benefit plan
fraction and the defined contribution plan fraction for any
limitation year may not exceed 1.0.
B. Defined Benefit Fraction.
(1) The defined benefit plan fraction for any limitation year is a
fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the participant's
projected annual benefits under all the defined benefit plans
(whether or not terminated) maintained by the employer, and
the denominator of which is the lesser of 125% of the dollar
limitation determined for the limitation year under Code
§§ 415(b) and (d) or 140% of the highest average
compensation, including any adjustments under Code § 415(b).
(2) Notwithstanding the above, if the participant was a participant
as of the first day of the first limitation year beginning after
§ 809 FOREWORD § 809
FWD:183
December 31, 1986, in one or more defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer which where in existence on May
6, 1986, the denominator of this fraction will not be less than
125% of the sum of the annual benefits under such plans
which the participant had accrued as of the close of the last
limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987, disregarding
any changes in the terms and conditions of the plan after May
5, 1986. The preceding sentence applies only if the defined
benefit plans individually and in the aggregate satisfied the
requirements of Code § 415 (including any applicable
elections) for all limitation years beginning before January 1,
1987.
C. Defined Contribution Fraction.
(1) The defined contribution plan fraction for any limitation year is
a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual
additions to the participant's account under all the defined
contribution plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by
the employer for the current and all prior limitation years
(including the annual additions attributable to the participant's
nondeductible employee contributions to all defined benefit
plans, whether or not terminated, maintained by the employer,
and the annual additions attributable to all welfare benefit
funds, as defined in Code § 419(e), and individual medical
accounts, as defined in Code § 415(1)(2), maintained by the
employer), and the denominator of which is the sum of the
maximum aggregate amounts for the current and all prior
limitation years of service with the employer (regardless of
whether a defined contribution plan was maintained by the
employer). The maximum aggregate amount in any limitation
year is the lesser of 125% of the dollar limitation determined
under Code § 415(b) and (d) in effect under Code § 415(c)(1)(A)
or 35% of the participant's compensation for such year.
(2) If the employee was a participant as of the end of the first day
of the first limitation year beginning after December 31, 1986,
in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the
employer which were in existence on May 6, 1986, the
numerator of this fraction will be adjusted if the sum of this
fraction and the defined benefit fraction would otherwise
exceed one under the terms of this plan. Under the adjustment,
an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess of the sum of
the fractions over one times (ii) the denominator of this
fraction, will be permanently subtracted from the numerator of
this fraction. The adjustment is calculated using the fractions
as they would be computed as of the end of the last limitation
year beginning before January 1, 1987, and disregarding any
changes in the terms and conditions of the plan made after
May 5, 1986, but using the Code § 415 limitation applicable to
§ 809 SAINT MARYS CODE § 809
FWD:184
the first limitation year beginning on or after January 1, 1987.
The annual addition for any limitation year beginning before
January 1, 1987, shall not be recomputed to treat all employee
contributions as annual additions.
D. If the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined
contribution plan fraction shall exceed one in any limitation year
for any participant in this plan, the administrator shall limit, to the
extent necessary, the annual additions to such participant's account
for such limitation year. If, after limiting the annual additions to
such participant's account for the limitation year, the sum of the
defined benefit plan fraction and the defined contribution plan
fraction still exceed one, the administrator shall then adjust the
numerator of the defined benefit plan fraction so that the sum of
both fractions shall not exceed one in any limitation year for such
participant.
Note: The above multiple plan reduction provisions apply only for
plan limitation years through 1999.
8. Incorporation of Code § 415 by Reference. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this plan or this section to the contrary, the limitations,
adjustments and other requirements prescribed in this section shall at
all times comply with the provisions of Code § 415 and the regulations
thereunder (as such apply to governmental plans), the terms of which
are specifically incorporated herein by reference. Thus, for the first 415
limitation year beginning after December 31, 1994, the applicable
mortality table described in Rev. Ruling 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80 shall be
utilized, and effective for plan years beginning after December 31,
1997, the term compensation for Code § 415 purposes, in accordance
with § 415(c)(3)(D) of the Code and Treasury Regulation § 1.415-2(d),
shall include:
A. An elective deferral [as defined in Code § 402(g)(3)]; and
B. Any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at
the election of the employee and which is includable in gross
income of the employee by reason of Code § 125 or 457
9. Required Distributions.
A. Notwithstanding any provision in this plan to the contrary, the
distribution of a participant's benefits shall be made in accordance
with the requirements and conditions and shall otherwise comply
with Code § 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder [including

Alternatively, distributions to a participant must begin no
later than the applicable April 1 as determined under the
preceding subsection and must be made over a period not
exceeding the life of the participant or the life expectancy
of the participant in accordance with regulations.
(2) Distributions to a participant and his beneficiaries shall only be

requirements of Code § 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations
thereunder.
B. Distributions made under Subsection 9A and B of this section shall
be subject to the provisions of § 804 of this Part.
10. Qualified Domestic Relations Order Distribution. All rights and benefits,
including elections, provided to a participant in this plan shall be
subject to the rights afforded to any alternate payee pursuant to a
domestic relations order as provided by applicable state law. In
evaluating any such domestic relations order, Code § 414(p) may be
used as a guide.
11. Direct Rollover.
A. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1,
1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an
eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement
plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
B. For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall
apply:
(1) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except
that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); and the
portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
(2) An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account
described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity
§ 809 SAINT MARYS CODE § 809
FWD:186
§ 810. The Pension Fund. [Ord. 152, 1/21/2002, Art. X]
described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code
§ 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a), that
accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the
surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual
retirement account or individual retirement annuity.
(3) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code § 414(p), are
distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse.
(4) A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.

this plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with
respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with

commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company, including any bank or trust
company which may act as a trustee hereunder or to invest in a
group contract or other funding arrangement. In this connection,
the commingling of the assets of this plan with assets of other
eligible, participating plans through such a medium is hereby
specifically authorized. Any assets of the plan which may be so
added to such collective trusts shall be subject to all of the
provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as amended from
time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan, to the extent
of the participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by
the plan.

upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons
§ 810 FOREWORD § 810

the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
P. To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the

is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose of
pension trust assets under the laws of more than one state; in such

manager or managers with respect to the acquisition and
disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts nor
omissions of such investment manager or managers, not shall it be
under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund

appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time by agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out his functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses and, in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse
themselves for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
5. Periodic Accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and

such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.

exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial

under Code § 401(a)(17).
5. Maximum Annual Benefit.
A. General Rule. Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code § 415 and the regulations

for any required change in the Code § 415(b) provisions, then the
change shall be effective as of the latest permissible effective date;
however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under Code
§ 415(b)(1)(A), whether required or permissible, shall take effect

other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(b) or (e), and
if the aggregated benefits would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code § 415(b) or (e), then benefits shall be reduced first under this
Plan. [Historical Note: Code § 415(e) applied for limitation years
beginning prior to 2000.]

additions, and any benefit attributable to participant contributions
is not included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code § 415(b)

addition will be eliminated in accordance with methods permitted
under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to 2009), or its
successor.
B. Multiple Plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(c), and if the
annual additions would otherwise exceed the limit under Code
§ 415(c), annual additions will first be reduced under the other
plan. If there is more than one other plan, annual additions will first
be reduced under the plan with the greatest amount of annual
additions.
C. Effective Date. The limits under which Code § 415(c) are adjusted
periodically in accordance with changes in the law or cost-of-living
§ 814 SAINT MARYS CODE § 814
FWD:196
adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If there is
more than one permissible effective date for any required change
relating to Code § 415(c), then the change shall be effective as of
the earliest permissible effective date.
D. DROP Account. Deposits into the participant's DROP account shall
be considered an annual addition subject to the limits set forth in
Code § 415(c).
E. For the purposes of this section, compensation includes only
those items specified in Treas. Reg. § I.415(c)-2(b)(1) or (2) and

the distributee may elect that the Plan Administrator transfer all or
part (provided that the part is at least $500 to any "eligible
retirement plan" capable of accepting such a transfer.

Effective as of January 1, 2002, clause (iii) does not apply to
any after-tax participant contributions that are paid to an
individual retirement account or annuity described in Code
§ 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan
described in Code § 401(a) or 403(a) or effective as of January

account for amounts so transferred, including separately

annuity described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described

spouse.

accordance with Code § 457(e)(17), make a trustee-to trustee
transfer from an eligible deferred compensation plan [as

purchasing service credit (to the extent that such purchases
are permitted under the terms of the Plan) or repaying a cashout
of contributions refunded under the Plan.
8. Minimum Required Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Plan to the contrary, the distribution of a participant's benefits shall be
made in accordance with the requirements and conditions of and shall
otherwise comply with Code § 401(a)(9). For purposes of complying
with Code § 401(a)(9), life expectancies shall be determined in
accordance with the 1987 proposed regulations prior to January 1,
2003, and with the final regulations [§ 1.401(a)(9)-1 through

elections, provided to a participant in this Plan shall be subject to the
rights afforded to any "alternate payee" under what is recognized
pursuant to state law support provisions as a "qualified domestic
relations order."
10. Vesting Upon Plan Termination. Upon the termination of this Plan, or
complete discontinuance of contributions [within the meaning of pre-
ERISA Code § 401(a)(7)] to this Plan, each employee, as of the date of
such termination or discontinuance, shall become vested to the extent
that the Plan is funded.

participant made prior to the earlier of age 62 or normal retirement age

participant. The DROP Option Form shall be signed by the DROP
participant, notarized and submitted to the employer prior to the date
on which the DROP participant wishes to enter the DROP (the "DROP
entry date"). The DROP Option Form shall constitute an irrevocable
notice to the employer by the DROP participant that the DROP
participant shall resign and terminate active employment with the
employer effective on the date specified on the DROP Option Form (the
"resignation date"). In no event shall the resignation date be sooner
than 12 months from the DROP entry date nor later than 24 months
from the DROP entry date. A DROP participant's employment with the
employer shall terminate on the resignation date, unless the DROP
participant's employment with the employer has been terminated prior
to the resignation date. As part of the election to participate in the
DROP, the DROP participant shall execute all documents required by
the Police Pension Board Administrator. Upon approval of the DROP
Option Form and accompanying documents, the election to participate
in the DROP shall be irrevocable.
4. Effect of DROP Participation on Accrued Benefit. Upon the participant's
DROP entry date, the DROP participant's accrued benefit under the
§ 814 SAINT MARYS CODE § 815
FWD:200
plan shall be finally determined, and the DROP participant shall accrue
no aggregate service after the DROP entry date for the purpose of
calculating any retirement benefits under the plan, and the DROP
participant's final average monthly salary for all purposes of calculating
retirement benefits under the plan shall be determined as of the day
prior to his DROP entry date.
5. Cost-of-living Adjustments (COLAs) for DROP Participants. The
retirement benefits payable to DROP participants after the DROP entry
date shall increase only as a result of COLAs in effect on the DROP
entry date or by applicable COLAs granted thereafter.
6. Payments to the DROP Account. The monthly retirement benefit
payable to the participant had the DROP participant elected to
terminate employment as of the DROP entry date, shall, upon the DROP
participant's entry into the DROP, be paid into a separate account
established for the purpose of receiving the DROP participant's monthly
pension benefit while a DROP participant ("the DROP account").
7. Effect of DROP Participation on Non-pension Benefits. Upon a DROP
participant's DROP entry date, the DROP participant shall continue to
accrue all non-pension contractual benefits, with the exception of the
right to have the employer buy-back accrued unused sick time or
vacation time. Prior to the DROP entry date, a DROP participant may
request payment for any accrued unused sick or vacation time which
the employer would otherwise be obligated to buy-back upon the DROP

participant's monthly pension benefits to the participant or his
designated beneficiary, as applicable. Within 30 days following the
DROP participant's termination of employment with the employer, the
balance of the DROP account shall be paid to the DROP participant in a
single lump-sum payment or, at the DROP participant's request, in any
fashion permitted by applicable law.
9. Disability of DROP Participant During DROP Participation. If a DROP
participant becomes temporarily incapacitated during participation in
the DROP, that participant shall continue to participate in the DROP as
if fully employed. The participant shall receive disability pay in the
same amount as a disabled participant that is not participating in the
DROP. In no event shall a participant on temporary disability have the
ability to draw from his DROP account. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this section, if a DROP participant is disabled and does not
§ 815 FOREWORD § 815
FWD:201
return to work as of his resignation date, such resignation shall take
precedence over all other provisions therein, and the DROP participant
shall be required to resign. Nothing contained in this DROP plan shall
be construed as conferring any legal rights upon any DROP participant
or other person to a continuation of employment, nor shall participation
in the DROP supersede or limit in any way the right of the employer to
honorably discharge a police officer based upon an inability to perform
his or her full duties as a police officer.
10. Death During DROP Participation. If a DROP participant dies before his
DROP account has been paid out, there shall be no further payments to
the DROP account under Subsection 6 hereof, and the DROP
participant's beneficiary shall have the same rights as the DROP
participant to payment of the DROP account.
11. Forfeiture of Benefits. Notwithstanding a DROP participant's
participation in the DROP, a DROP participant who is convicted or
pleads guilty to engaging in criminal misconduct which constitutes a
"crime related to public office or public employment," as that phrase is
defined in Pennsylvania's Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311 and
1314, shall forfeit his right to receive a pension, including any amounts
held in his DROP account. In such a case, the DROP participant shall
only be entitled to receive a return of participant contributions, if any,
made by the participant to the Pension Fund.
12. DROP Account Manager. The employer and the participants will
mutually agree upon an investment manager to administer the DROP
accounts. The employer shall not be responsible for any investment loss
incurred in the DROP accounts or for the failure of an investment to
earn a specific or expected return or to earn as much as any other
opportunity, whether or not such other investment opportunity was
offered or available to participants in the plan.
13. Costs of Maintaining DROP Plan. Any costs or fees associated with the
management of DROP accounts shall be paid directly from the plan and
not by the employer.
14. Amendment. Amendments to the DROP shall be consistent with the
DROP provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and
shall be binding upon current and future DROP participants.
Amendments to the DROP must be made by a written instrument, and
the DROP cannot be amended by oral agreement or past practice.
15. Effective Date. The DROP shall be effective as of January 1, 2004, and
implemented pursuant to the terms of the applicable collective
bargaining agreement.
16. Construction. A participant's election to participate in the DROP shall in
no way be construed so as to limit the employer's right to suspend or
terminate a police officer for just cause or to grant the officer an
honorable discharge based upon a physical or mental inability to
perform his or her duties.

1. Prohibited Discharge Standards. No industrial user shall introduce or
cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater
which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions
apply to all industrial users of the POTW whether or not they are
subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national,
state or local pretreatment standards or requirement. Furthermore, no
industrial user may contribute the following substances to the POTW:
A. Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal
wastewater collection and POTW including, but not limited to,
waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140° F.
(60°C.) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR § 261.21.
B. Any wastewater having a pH of less than 5.0 or more than 10.0 or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or
equipment or endangering City personnel.
C. Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause
obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in
no case solids greater than three inches in any dimension.
D. Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen
demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow
rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by
interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with
either the POTW or any wastewater treatment or sludge process, or
which will constitute a hazard to humans or animals. In no case
shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or
quantities of pollutants that exceed, for any time period longer than
15 minutes, more than two times the average twenty-four-hour
concentration, quantities or flow rate during normal operation
period.
E. Any wastewater having a temperature greater than 104° F. (40° C.)
or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant
resulting in interference.
F. Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
§ 201 SAINT MARYS CODE § 202
FWD:408
G. Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute
worker health and safety problems.
H. Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the City in accordance with § 203(5).
I. Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life,
or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
J. Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by
the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to
the treatment plant's effluent thereby violating the City's NPDES
permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the
treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation
point for photosynthetic activity by more than 10% from the
seasonably established norm for aquatic life.
K. Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes
except as specifically approved by the Manager in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations.
L. Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate,
deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted
industrial wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the
Manager.
M. Any sludges, screening, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes.
N. Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the
Manager in a wastewater discharge permit.
O. Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a
toxicity test.
P. Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other
substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
Q. Any discharge of fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin
in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
R. Wastewater that will cause two readings on an explosion hazard
meter at the point of discharge into the POTW or at any point in the
POTW to be more than 5% or any single reading to be over 10% of
the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.
§ 202 FOREWORD § 202
FWD:409
Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored
in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All
floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must
discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before
connecting with the POTW.
2. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The national categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405-471, are incorporated herein as fully as if set forth in their
entirety.
3. Specific Pollutant Limitations.
A. Specific pollutant limitations shall be controlled by each individual
user's nondomestic wastewater discharge permit.
B. Concentrations as set forth in the permits shall apply at the point
where the industrial waste is discharged to the POTW. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless
indicated otherwise.
4. City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish by
ordinance and reserves the right to establish by wastewater discharge
permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the
POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in
§ 201(1) of this Part or the general and specific prohibitions in § 202(1)
of this Part.
5. Special Agreement. The City reserves the right to enter into special
agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which
they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement
waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement.
However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a
categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.15. They may
also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard
from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user
can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that
pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally
different factor variance must comply with the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR § 403.13.
6. Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water,
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable
pretreatment standard or requirement. The Manager may impose mass
limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases
when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

FWD:410
§ 203. Pretreatment of Wastewater. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994; as amended
by Ord. 232, 6/4/2007]
7. Net/Gross Determination. Categorical pretreatment standards may be
adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's
intake water in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.15.
1. Pretreatment Facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Part and shall
achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local
limits and the prohibitions set out in § 202(1), above, within the time
limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the Manager  whichever
is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated, and maintained
at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the City for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge to the City under the provisions of this Part.
2. Additional Pretreatment Measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Manager may require industrial
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements
of this Part.
B. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling
of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or
sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interception units shall be of type and
capacity approved by the Manager and shall be so located to be
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the owner at his expense.
C. Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable
substances may be required to install and maintain an approved
combustible gas detection meter.
D. At no time shall two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the
point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, be
more than 5% nor shall any single reading be over 10% of the lower
explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.
§ 202 FOREWORD § 203
FWD:411
3. Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. The Manager may require any
industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug
control plan. At least once every two years, the Manager shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. An
industrial user will be evaluated by the manager within one year of
being identified as a significant industrial user.
Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a
minimum, the following:
A. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
B. Description of stored chemicals.
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental
or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any
discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in
§ 202(1) of this Part.
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants
(including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
4. Tenant's Responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if
either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may
be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Part.
5. Hauled Wastewater.
A. Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated
receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such
times as are established by the Manager, provided such wastes do
not violate § 202 of this Part or any other requirements established
or adopted by the City. Wastewater discharge permits for individual
vehicles to use such facilities shall be issued by the Manager.
B. The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as "industrial septage"
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from
the City. The Manager shall have authority to prohibit the disposal
of such wastes, if such disposal would interfere with the treatment
plant operation. Waste haulers are subject to all sections of this
Part.
§ 203 SAINT MARYS CODE § 203
FWD:412
C. Fees for dumping septage will be established as part of the
industrial user fee system as authorized in § 215.
6. Vandalism. No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any
person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the
sanctions set out in §§ 210-212 below.
7. Maximum Allowable Industrial Loadings. [Added by Ord. 304, 6/19/
2017]
A. No industrial user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into
the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) any of the following
pollutants which will cause the loading of the POTW to exceed any
of the following described local limits:
Pollutant of Concern
Local Limit
(lbs/day)
Arsenic 0.3643
Beryllium 0.3232
Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate 0.2530

Selenium 0.0771
Silver 0.6750
Zinc 20.4433
Sulfate 3210.4984
Sulfide 26.5207
B. The City reserves the right to allocate individual pollutants in an
individual industrial user permit as necessary to ensure that the
local limit loadings of the specific pollutants are not exceeded
within the POTW.
C. Allocations to individual industrial user permit holders will be
made on an as-needed basis while maintaining appropriate local
limit reserves for each pollutant.
§ 203 FOREWORD § 203
FWD:413
§ 204. Wastewater Discharge Permit Eligibility. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994]
D. The City also reserves the right to revise the amount of individual
pollutants allowed under any industrial user permit as may be
necessary to maintain the local limit loadings set by this
subsection.
E. The limits appearing in an individual industrial user permit shall be
the enforceable limits for that individual user.
F. Any violation of a permit limit shall be considered a violation of
these regulations.
1. Wastewater Survey. When requested by the Manager, all industrial
users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of
their wastewater by completing a wastewater survey prior to
commencing their discharge. The Manager is authorized to prepare a
form for this purpose and may periodically require industrial users to
update the survey. Failure to complete this survey shall be reasonable
ground for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be
considered a violation of this Part.
2. Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.
A. It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to discharge
wastewater into the City's POTW without first obtaining a
wastewater discharge permit from the Manager. Any violation of
the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be
deemed a violation of this Part and subjects the wastewater
discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§ 210-212.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a
permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law.
B. The Manager may require other industrial users, including liquid
waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as
necessary to carry out the purpose of this Part.
3. Wastewater Discharge Permitting Existing Connections. Any significant
industrial user which discharges industrial waste into the POTW prior
to the effective date of this Part, who wishes to continue such
discharges in the future and who does not have currently an existing
nondomestic wastewater discharge permit, shall, within 30 days after
said date, apply to the City for a wastewater discharge permit in
accordance with Subsection 6 below and shall not cause or allow
discharges to the POTW to continue after 90 days from the effective
date of this Part except in accordance with a wastewater discharge
permit issued by the Manager.
4. Wastewater Discharge Permitting New Connections. Any significant
industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging
§ 203 SAINT MARYS CODE § 204
FWD:414
industrial wastes into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge
permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An
application for the wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least
90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin.
5. Wastewater Discharge Permitting Extra-Jurisdictional Industrial Users.
A. Any existing significant industrial user located beyond the City
limit, excepting those with current NWDP, shall submit a
wastewater discharge permit application, in accordance with
Subsection 6 below, within 90 days of the effective date of this Part.
New significant industrial users located beyond the City of St.
Marys limits shall submit such applications to the Manager 90 days
prior to any proposed discharge into the POTW.
B. Alternately, the Manager may enter into an agreement with the
neighboring jurisdiction in which the significant industrial user is
located to provide for the implementation and enforcement of
pretreatment program requirements against said industrial user.
6. Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents. In order to be
considered for a wastewater discharge permit, all industrial users
required to have a wastewater discharge permit must submit to the City
the information required by § 206(1)(B) of this Part. The Manager shall
approve a form to be used as a permit application. In addition, the
following information may be requested:
A. Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the
premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or
stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or
intentionally be, discharged to the POTW.

person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is
to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.
I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations."
8. Wastewater Discharge Permit Decisions. The Manager will evaluate the
data furnished by the industrial user and may require additional
information. Within 10 days of receipt of a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, the Manager will determine in writing
whether to issue or deny the permit or to refer the application to other
appropriate officials for further investigation; provided that a final
determination regarding the application shall be made within 60 days
of receipt of the completed application. If no determination is made
within 60 days, the application will be deemed denied. The Manager
may deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit for cause.
1. Wastewater Discharge Permit Duration. Wastewater discharge permits
shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less than five
years at the discretion of Manager. Each wastewater discharge permit
will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.
2. Wastewater Discharge Permit Contents. Wastewater discharge permits
shall include such conditions as are reasonably deemed necessary by
the Manager to prevent pass through or interference, protect the
quality of the water body receiving the treatment plant's effluent,
protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge management and
disposal, protect ambient air quality, and protect against damage to the
POTW.
A. Wastewater discharge permits must contain the following
conditions:

compliance with all applicable federal and state pretreatment
standards, including those which become effective during the
term of the wastewater discharge permit.
(8) Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Manager to
ensure compliance with this Part, and state and federal laws,
rules and regulations.
(9) Requirements for the submission of the data necessary for use
in the combined waste stream formula as provided by 40 CFR
Part 403.6(e).
3. Wastewater Discharge Permit Appeals. Any person, including the
industrial user, may petition the City of St. Marys to reconsider the
terms of a wastewater discharge permit within 10 days of its issuance.
A. Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be
a waiver of the administrative appeal.
B. In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater
discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for the
objections, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in
the wastewater discharge permit.
C. The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be
stayed pending the appeal.
D. If the City of St. Marys fails to act within 10 days, a request for
reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to
reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a
wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater
discharge permit, shall be considered final administrative action
for purposes of judicial review.
E. Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative
wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the Court of Common Pleas of the 59th Judicial
District of Pennsylvania, Elk County Branch, within 30 days of the
date of the City's decision or, if the City fails to act on the petition
for reconsideration within 10 days of the filing of the petition, then
within 30 days of the day upon which it is deemed denied. (See 42
Pa.C.S.A. § 933, and 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5571(b).)
4. Wastewater Discharge Permit Modification. The Manager may modify
the wastewater discharge permit for good cause including, but not
limited to, the following:
A. To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
B. To address significant alterations or additions to the industrial
user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume of character
since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance.
§ 205 SAINT MARYS CODE § 205
FWD:418
C. A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge.
D. Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the City of St. Marys POTW, the City's personnel or the receiving
waters.
E. Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit.

H. To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater
discharge permit.
I. To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a
new owner/operator.
The filing of a request by the permittee for a wastewater discharge
permit modification does not stay any wastewater discharge
permit condition.
5. Wastewater Discharge Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits
may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner and/or operator only
if the permittee gives at least 30 days' advance notice to the Manager
and the Manager approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer.
The notice to the Manager must include a written certification by the
new owner and/or operator which:
A. States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent
to change the facility's operations and processes.
B. Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
C. Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the
wastewater discharge permit voidable on the date of facility
transfer.
6. Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation. Wastewater discharge
permits may be revoked for the following reasons:
A. Failure to notify the City of St. Marys of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge.
B. Failure to provide prior notification to the City of St. Marys of
changed condition pursuant to § 206(5).
§ 205 FOREWORD § 205

Marys with access to all information that the municipal user
obtains as part of its pretreatment activities.
(5) Limits on the nature, quality and volume of the municipal
user's wastewater at the point where it discharges to the
POTW.
(6) Requirements for monitoring the municipal user's discharge.
C. Violation of the terms and conditions of the municipal user's
wastewater discharge permit subjects the municipal user to the
sanctions set out in §§ 210 and 212.
1. Baseline Monitoring Reports.
A. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing significant industrial users subject to such
categorical pretreatment standards, and currently discharging to
or scheduled to discharge to the POTW, shall be required to submit
to the City of St. Marys a report which contains the information
listed in Subsection 1B below. At least 90 days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that
become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the
City of St. Marys a report which contains the information listed in
Subsection 1B below. A new source shall also be required to report
the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of
its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.
B. The industrial user shall submit the information required by this
section, including:
§ 205 FOREWORD § 206
FWD:421
(1) Identifying Information. The name and address of the facility
including the name of the operator and owners.
(2) Wastewater Discharge Permits. A list of any environmental
control wastewater discharge permits held by or for the
facility.
(3) Description of Operations. A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production and standard industrial
classifications of the operations(s) carried out by such
industrial user. This description should include a schematic
process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the
POTW from the regulated process.
(4) Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured
average daily maximum flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW
from regulated process streams and other streams, as
necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula
set out in 40 CFR § 403-6(e).
(5) Measurement of Pollutants.
(a) Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable
to each regulated process.
(b) Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by
the standard or by the City of St. Marys) of regulated
process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long term
average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in Subsection 10.
(c) Sampling must be performed in accordance with
procedures set out in Subsection 11.
(d) Where process effluent is mixed, prior to treatment, with
wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated
process, the industrial user is to provide sufficient data for
use in the combined waste stream formula consistent with
40 CFR Part 403.6(e).
(6) Certification. A statement reviewed by the industrial user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional
operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards
and requirements.
§ 206 SAINT MARYS CODE § 206
FWD:422
(7) Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the
shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide
such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in § 204(6)(N) of this Part.
(8) All baseline monitoring must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 204(7).
2. Compliance Schedule Progress Report. The following conditions shall
apply to the schedule required by § 206(1)(B)(7). The schedule shall
contain progress increments in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events
include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and
completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation).
No increment referred above shall exceed nine months. The industrial
user shall submit a progress report to the Manager no later than 14
days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established
schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Manager.
3. Report on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards
and requirements shall submit to the City of St. Marys a report
containing the information described in § 20(6)(1)(B)(4-6). For
industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures of 40 CFR 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long
term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual
production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 204(7).
4. Periodic Compliance Reports.
A. Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard
shall, at a frequency determined by the Manager but in no case less
§ 206 FOREWORD § 206
FWD:423
than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards and
the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for
the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with § 204(7).
B. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance
with a best management practice (or pollution prevention
alternative), the industrial user shall submit documentation
required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine compliance status for the industrial user. At
the discretion of the control authority, the months which the above
reports are to be submitted may be modified.
C. All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial
user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in
good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
D. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of
this section monitors any regulated pollutant more frequently than
required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in
Subsection 11 of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be
included in the report.
5. Report of Changed Conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify
the Manager of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of
its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
A. The Manager may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under § 204(6).
B. The Manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
§ 204(8) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§ 205(4).
C. No industrial user shall implement the planned changed
condition(s) until and unless the Manager has responded to the
industrial user's notice.
D. A change in the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which
the industrial user has submitted initial notification is subject to
this requirement.
§ 206 SAINT MARYS CODE § 206
FWD:424
E. For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10% or greater
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutant shall be
deemed significant.
6. Reports of Potential Problems.
A. In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause
potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the
prohibited discharge standards in § 202(1) of this Part), it is the
responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and
notify the City of St. Marys of the incident. This notification shall
include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial
user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the Manager, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences.
Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve
the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability
which may be imposed by this Part.
C. Failure to notify the City of St. Marys of potential problem
discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this Part.
D. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom
to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection 6A
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
7. Reports from Nonsignificant Industrial Users. All industrial users not
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and not required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports
to the City of St. Marys as the Manager may require. In cases where a
local limit requires compliance with a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the industrial user shall submit
documentation as required by the control authority to determine the
compliance status of the industrial user.
8. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user
must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control
§ 206 FOREWORD § 206
FWD:425
authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The
industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs
monitoring at the industrial user's at least once a month, or if the POTW
performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and
when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
9. Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
A. Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number,
and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the
industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain
the following information available to the industrial user; an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during the calendar
month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted
under Subsection 5 above. The notification requirement in this
section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the selfmonitoring
requirements of Subsections 1, 3 and 4 above.
B. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 1 of
this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no
more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§ 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§ 201.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the industrial user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
C. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user
must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of
such regulations.
§ 206 SAINT MARYS CODE § 206
FWD:426
§ 207. Compliance Monitoring. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994; as amended by
Ord. 15, 6/6/1994, § 4]
D. In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce
the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical.
10. Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified
in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136,
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with
procedures approved by the EPA.
11. Sampling Collection.
A. Except as indicated in Subsection 11B below, the industrial user
must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional
composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional
sampling is infeasible, the Manager may authorize the use of time
proportional sampling or through a minimum of four grab samples
where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge
limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
12. Determination of Noncompliance. The Manager may use a grab
sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
13. Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date post marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of
receipt of the report shall govern.
14. Recordkeeping. Industrial users shall retain, and make available for
inspection and copying, all records and information required to be
retained under this Part. These records shall remain available for a
period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with
this Part, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the Manager.
1. Inspection and Sampling. The City of St. Marys shall have the right to
enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this Part, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being
§ 206 FOREWORD § 207
FWD:427
met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements
thereof. Industrial users shall allow the Manager or his representatives
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspecting,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
A. Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the industrial user shall make necessary with its security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the City of St. Marys, state and EPA will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
their specific responsibilities.
B. The City of St. Marys, state and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the industrial user's property, or require installation of, such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of
the user's operations.
C. The City of St. Marys may require the industrial user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal
request of the Manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be born by the industrial user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing City personnel access to the
industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this Part.
2. Search Warrants. If the Manager has been refused access to a building,
structure or property, or any part thereof, and if the Manager has
demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this Part or that there is need to inspect as part of a routine inspection
program of the City of St. Marys designed to verify compliance with this
Part or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon
application by the City's Attorney, the District Justice having
jurisdiction shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing
therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall
specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the
property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours
by the Manager in the company of a uniformed police officer of the City
of St. Marys. In the event of an emergency affecting public health and
safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant.
§ 207 SAINT MARYS CODE § 208
FWD:428
§ 208. Confidential Information. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994; as amended by
Ord. 15, 6/6/1994, § 5]
Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits,
and monitoring programs, and from City inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the industrial user
specifically designates that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated
by the industrial user furnishing a report, that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program,
and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as
defined by 40 CFR § 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.
§ 209. Publication of Industrial Users in Significant
Noncompliance. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994; as amended by Ord. 232, 6/4/
2007]
The City shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the City of St. Marys, or in The Daily Press, a list of the industrial users
which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term
significant noncompliance shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed the
instantaneous limits.
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
(including instantaneous limits) multiplied by the applicable TRC: (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH).
C. Any other violation(s) of a pretreatment standard or requirement that
the City determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference (e.g., slug loads) or pass through or
endangered the health of City personnel or the general public.
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the City's exercise
of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
§ 208 FOREWORD § 209
FWD:429
§ 210. Administrative Enforcement Remedies. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994]
E. Failure to provide, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance.
F. Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance
reports, and reports on compliance within compliance schedules.
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
H. Any other violation(s) which the City determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
1. Notification of Violation. Whenever the Manager finds that any user has
violated or is violating this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the
Manager or his agent may serve upon said user a written notice of
violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the
user to the Manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user
of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
City to take any action, including emergency action or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
2. Consent Orders. The Manager is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such order will include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections 4
and 5 below and shall be judicially enforceable.
3. Show-Cause Hearing. The Manager may order an user which causes or
contributes to violation(s) of this Part, wastewater discharge permits,
or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Manager and show cause why a
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears
as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following
§ 209 SAINT MARYS CODE § 210
FWD:430
the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against the user.
4. Compliance Orders. When the Manager finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirements, the Manager may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders
may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged into the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including
any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
5. Cease-and-Desist Orders. When the Manager finds that a user is
violating this Part, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements.
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operating and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the user.
6. Administrative Fines.
A. Notwithstanding any other section of this Part, any user that is
found to have violated any provision of this Part, its wastewater
discharge permit, and/or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be fined in an amount
not to exceed $1,000 per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a perviolation,
per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term
average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.
B. Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer
service charge, and the Manager shall have such other collection
remedies as may be available for other service charges and fees.
§ 210 FOREWORD § 210
FWD:431
C. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties, after 30 calendar days, shall
be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance,
and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A
lien against the individual user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines and penalties.
D. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within five days of being notified of the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Manager shall convene a hearing on the
matter within 10 days of receiving the request from the industrial
user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment
together with any interest accruing thereto shall be returned to the
industrial user. The City may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to
the fine.
E. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be prerequisite for
taking any other action against the user.
7. Emergency Suspension. The Manager may immediately suspend a
user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and
also opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Manager shall allow the user
to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the City that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in Subsection
8 are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit to the Manager
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
Subsections 3 and 8, a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
§ 210 SAINT MARYS CODE § 210
FWD:432
§ 211. Judicial Enforcement Remedies. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994; as
amended by Ord. 15, 6/6/1994, §§ 6, 7, 8]
8. Termination of Discharge. In addition to those provisions in § 205(6) of
this Part, any user that violates the following conditions of this Part,
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder is subject to
discharge termination.
A. Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
B. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
C. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
E. Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 202 of this Part.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
Subsection 3 of this section why the proposed action should not be
taken.
1. Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this
Part, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment requirement, the Manager may petition the Court of
Common Pleas of the 59th Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Elk County
Branch, through the City's Attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or
other requirement imposed by the Part on activities of the industrial
user. Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief
may also be sought by the City. A petition for injunctive relief need not
be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
2. Civil Penalties.
A. Any user which has violated or continues to violate this Part, any
order or wastewater discharge permit hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for
a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation per day. In the case
of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B. The City may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual
damages incurred by the City.
§ 210 FOREWORD § 211

duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user,
and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for taking
any other action against a user.
3. Criminal Prosecution.
A. Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
Part, any order or wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of an offense, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000
plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a
term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. Each day on which an

§ 212. Supplemental Enforcement Action. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994]
§ 213. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations. [Ord. 4, 1/31/
1994; as amended by Ord. 15, 6/6/1994, § 9]
1. Performance Bonds. The Manager may decline to reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the
provisions of this Part, any order, or a previous wastewater discharge
permit issued hereunder, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond,
payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the
Manager to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
2. Liability Insurance. The Manager may decline to reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the
provisions of this Part, any order, or a previous wastewater discharge
permit issued hereunder, unless the user first submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to
the POTW caused by its discharge.
3. Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this Part, order, or wastewater discharge
permit issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after the user has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
4. Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved consistent
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements
are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or
services to the City. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services
to the City held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment standards may be terminated at the discretion of the City.
1. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An
upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or
careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection 1C are met.
C. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
§ 212 FOREWORD § 213
FWD:435
(1) An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset.
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
work-manlike manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures.
(3) The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days
thereafter):
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue.
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
F. The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative
method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
2. General/Specific Prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in § 202(1) of
this Part if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that
its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: (a) a
local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference, or (b) no local limit exists, but the discharge
did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's
prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its
NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with
applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
§ 213 SAINT MARYS CODE § 213
FWD:436
3. Bypass.
A. Definitions.
(1) BYPASS  The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
(2) SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE  Substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does
not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of
Subsections 3C and D of this section.
C. Advance Need.
(1) If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the POTW at least 10 days before
the date of the bypass if possible.
(2) An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the
POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
D. Bypass Prohibited.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless;
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage.
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods
of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in
§ 213 FOREWORD § 213
FWD:437
§ 214. Surcharge Costs. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994]
An industrial user will be surcharged at the then-current rate for BOD for
all concentrations in excess of 300 mg/l; for TSS for all concentrations in
excess of 350 mg/l; and for NH3-N for all concentrations in excess of 30 mg/
l.
§ 215. Miscellaneous Provisions. [Ord. 4, 1/31/1994]
the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.
(c) The industrial user submitted notices as required under
Subsection 3C of this section.
(2) The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection 3D(1) of this
section.
1. Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The City may adopt reasonable
charges and fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating
the City's pretreatment program, which may include:
A. Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications, including the
cost of processing such applications.
B. Fees or monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user's
discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by
industrial users.
C. Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction.
D. Fees for filing appeals.
E. Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the

Deferred Assessments Rules and Regulations.
§ 411. Deferred Assessment Procedure. [Res. 11/16/1998]
Pursuant to § 407, the City has adopted the following rules and regulations
relating to deferred assessments:
A. The deferred assessment procedure was adopted by City Council to
encourage the installation of public improvements in rural areas of the
City. Deferred assessments are a matter of privilege and not of right.
The City always reserves the right to decline to provide deferred
assessments where they would be inequitable or would not conform to
the spirit and intent of this Part.
B. Deferred assessments are available only for vacant property having a
frontage on the improvement of more than 200 feet. A property is
considered to be "vacant" if:
(1) There are no dwellings, commercial or industrial buildings or other
occupied structures on the land.
(2) In cases of large properties (such as farms), where there are
occupied structures, all of the occupied structures are at least 200
feet distant from the right-of-way boundary for the public
improvement and the land fronting on the improvement is capable
of future subdivision or future residential, commercial or industrial
use.
(3) If there is an occupied building on the property, the property is
capable of being subdivided into two or more usable lots, in which
event, the deferred assessment will be applied only to those
subdividable lots on which there is no occupied building.
C. Where a deferred assessment is offered to only part of a property and
no subdivision map is of record, the municipal claim filed at the Elk
County Courthouse shall reflect that the assessment is partially
deferred. This may be accomplished by attaching a map or property
description to the municipal claim.
D. Payment shall become due on a deferred assessment whenever:
(1) The owner makes application for a building permit on the property.
(2) Where a property subject to a deferred assessment has been
subdivided, whenever a lot is sold or transferred, in which case a
proportionate share of the deferred assessment shall be due for
that lot.
E. In the event of a situation not covered by these regulations, the City
Manager shall have discretion to determine whether and on what terms
a deferred assessment will be made available to a particular property.

the transfer of real estate or interest in real estate situated within the

prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq.; so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the City Council under the authority of
that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax exists, except
as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate; and such 1/2 shall
become effective without any action on the part of the City Council;
provided, however, that the City of St. Marys and any other political
subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or transfer may
agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate

herein provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total

effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend or
limit existing record legal title or interest.
E. A transfer or division in kind, for no or nominal actual consideration, of

testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a
decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
H. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an

by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that the property
was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit of, his principal,

the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee claims an exemption
from taxation under this subsection.

to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a
copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the City for the year prior to the fiscal year for

be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1.

office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an
amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer

October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.11(b), the Pennsylvania
Storm Water Management Act.
§ 104. Statutory Authority. [Ord. 291, 8/18/2014]
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety and
welfare and the protection of people of the City, their resources and the
environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which protects and maintains surface water quality.
1. Primary Authority. The municipality is required to regulate these
activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act
167), 32 P.S. Section 680.11(b), as amended, the Storm Water
Management Act, and the St. Marys Home Rule Charter.
2. Secondary Authority. The municipality is empowered to regulate land
use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,

Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Part are hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 107. Severability. [Ord. 291, 8/18/2014]
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Part invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this Part.
§ 108. Compatibility with Other Ordinance Requirements. [Ord.
291, 8/18/2014]
Approvals issued and actions taken under this Part do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 109. Municipal Liability Disclaimer. [Ord. 291, 8/18/2014]
§ 110. Word Usage; Definitions. [Ord. 291, 8/18/2014]
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
as amended.
1. Neither the granting of any approval under this Part, nor the
compliance with the provisions of this Part, or with any condition
imposed by a Municipal official hereunder, shall relieve any person from
any responsibility for damage to persons or property resulting
therefrom or as otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon
the City for damages to persons or property.
2. The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management
facilities shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of
any kind by the City, or by an official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed, and
shall create no liability upon or cause of action against such public
body, official or employee for any damage that may result thereto.
3. The adoption of this Part does not impose on the City any affirmative
duty to regulate stormwater management facilities which preexisted
this Part.

be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities shall be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff.

7. All flow assumptions and source of supporting data shall be provided as
part of the overall plan. The municipality reserves the right to reject any
submitted values, despite the source, and to provide a substitute source
for use by the applicant.
8. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning Equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with generally accepted values from a
legitimate and verifiable source. All flow assumptions and source of
supporting data shall be provided as part of the overall plan. The
municipality reserves the right to reject any submitted values, despite
the source, and to provide a substitute source for use by the applicant.
Full flow capacity shall be assumed for closed conduits. Storm sewer
systems consisting of more than three pipe junctions shall be designed
using hydraulic grade line computations.
9. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this Part using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method. The design
of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this Part shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph (i.e. TR-20, TR-55, and HECHMS).
10. Downstream Analysis. Where deemed necessary by the municipal
engineer, the applicant shall submit an analysis of the impacts of
detained stormwater flows on downstream areas within the watershed,
established with the concurrence of the municipal engineer. The
analysis shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary
to determine the impact of peak discharge modifications of the
proposed development on critical locations such as dams, tributaries,
existing developments, undersized culverts, and flood-prone areas.
Review and comment of the analysis by the engineer of a downstream
municipality shall be obtained as deemed necessary.
1. Stormwater management and related facilities shall be provided:
A. To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses. Such flow may
be redirected as required, subject to the approval of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
B. To ensure adequate drainage of all street low points.
2. Storm sewers and related installations:
§ 116 SAINT MARYS CODE § 117
FWD:602
A. Storm sewers, where required, shall be placed as directed by the
municipality.
B. When located in undedicated land, they shall be placed within a
drainage easement not less than 20 feet wide as approved by the
municipality.
C. The use of properly designed, graded, and vegetated drainage
channels is encouraged in lieu of storm sewers in commercial and
industrial areas and, where approved by the municipality, in
residential areas. Such swales shall be designed to not only carry
the required discharge without excessive erosion, but also to
increase the time of concentration, reduce the peak discharge and
velocity, and permit the water to percolate into the soil, where
appropriate. Criteria related to the use and design of drainage
swales are as follows:
(1) Where vegetated drainage swales are used in lieu of or in
addition to storm sewers, they shall be designed to carry the
ten-year discharge without erosion, and also to increase the
time of concentration, reduce the peak discharge and velocity,
and permit the water to percolate into the soil.
(2) The maximum encroachment of water on the roadway
pavement along roadside swales in cut areas shall not exceed
half of a through traffic lane during a ten-year frequency storm
of five-minute duration. Frequent and/or sustained flooding of
the sub-base shall be avoided.
(3) The design of all vegetated channels shall, as a minimum,
conform to the design procedures outlined in the Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual (PA DEP). Inlets
shall be provided to limit road shoulder encroachment and
water velocity.
(4) The side slope for any vegetated drainage channel requiring
mowing of the vegetation shall have a maximum grade of three
horizontal to one vertical on those areas to be mowed.
Maximum side slopes for any vegetated drainage channel shall
be two horizontal to one vertical.
(5) Erosion Prevention. All drainage swales shall be designed to
prevent the erosion of the bed and bank areas. Suitable
temporary and/or permanent stabilization during vegetative
cover establishment shall be provided to prevent erosion.
(6) Storm sewers or drainage swales shall discharge to a detention
or retention basin to attenuate the peak rate and volume,
respectively, of stormwater runoff, except as provided in the
plan.
§ 117 FOREWORD § 117
FWD:603
D. The design capacity of storm sewers shall be in accordance with
PennDOT Drainage Manual, Publication Number 584, as amended.
Storm drainage systems shall be designed without surcharging
inlets to provide conveyance of stormwater runoff into a detention
basin or similar facility utilized to manage the rate of stormwater
runoff. To avoid surcharging inlets, and to ensure that inlets will
receive stormwater runoff, the hydraulic grade line at the inlet
shall be at least six inches below the elevation of the inlet grate.
Where site grading will direct stormwater runoff from the onehundred-
year design storm to a detention basin or similar facility
utilized to manage the rate of stormwater runoff, then the storm
sewer may be designed for the ten-year design storm. Where site
grading will not direct stormwater runoff from the one-hundredyear
design storm to a detention basin or similar facility utilized to
manage the rate of stormwater runoff, then the storm sewer shall
be designed for the one-hundred-year design storm. The location of
the hydraulic grade line for the one-hundred-year design storm
shall be graphically shown on the required storm sewer profile
drawings. Conveyance of storms to the detention basin, up to and
including the one-hundred-year frequency, shall be provided so as
not to endanger life or seriously damage property.
E. Storm inlet types and inlet assemblies shall conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standards for
Roadway Construction as approved by the municipality.
F. Accessible drainage structures shall be located on a continuous
storm sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at all locations
where a transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all
vertical and horizontal angle points exceeding 5°, and at all points
of convergence of two or more influent storm sewer mains. The
construction locations of accessible drainage structures shall be as
indicated on the subdivision drainage plan or area drainage plan
approved by the municipality.
G. When evidence available to the municipality indicates that existing
storm sewers have sufficient capacity as determined by hydrograph
summation and are accessible, proposed stormwater facilities may
connect to the existing storm sewers so long as the peak rate of
discharge does not exceed the amount permitted by this Part.
3. Multiple-Use Basins. The design and construction of multiple-use
stormwater detention facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to
stormwater management, where appropriate, facilities allow for
recreational uses, including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds, etc.
Provision for parking facilities within basins and permanent wet ponds
with stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
Prior approval and consultation with the municipality are required
before design. Multiple-use basins shall be constructed so that
potentially dangerous conditions are not created.
§ 117 SAINT MARYS CODE § 117
FWD:604
4. Multiple-Development Basins. Stormwater management facilities
designed to serve more than one property or development in the same
watershed are encouraged. Staged construction of existing or proposed
multiple-use detention facilities by several developers in conjunction
with watershed development is encouraged. Each applicant shall be
responsible for the incremental increase in stormwater runoff
generated by the respective development and incremental construction
improvements necessary for the overall detention facility. Prior
approval and consultation with the municipality is required before
design of such facilities.
5. Alternative Detention Facilities. Alternative stormwater detention
facilities including roof top, subsurface basins or tanks and in-pipe
detention storage, or other approved alternative designs are permitted
as determined by the municipality.
6. Landscaping of Stormwater Management Facilities. Facilities
constructed with berms or earthen embankments shall not be
landscaped along the top of the impoundment berm, embankment, nor
shall other facility areas constructed from compacted fill materials be
landscaped. Heavy vegetative cover root penetration can cause soil
weakening and damage to facility piping.
7. All wet basins shall be designed in a manner that seeks to mitigate the
proliferation of mosquito breeding habitats and the potential spread of
the West Nile Virus. This can be accomplished through the following
means:
A. The design of a stormwater wetland/wet basin must include the
selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake
capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector
mosquito breeding. The establishment of hydrophytic vegetation
will promote the population of the wetland/wet basin by
amphibians and other mosquito predators. Refer to Appendix B of
the PA SWM BMP Manual (current version) for hydrophytic native
plant species lists.
B. Aeration fountains and stocked fish can be added to keep larval
mosquito populations in check.
8. The municipality reserves the right to disapprove any design that would
result in the construction or continuation of a stormwater problem area.
9. When the elevation of any existing or proposed entrance to a structure,
including windows, is lower than the elevation of the public cartway
serving that site, a grading plan shall be submitted, reviewed and
approved as part of the SWM approval process for the proposed
structure.
10. No stormwater detention facility shall be placed within 50 feet of a
special geologic feature. No subsurface stormwater conveyance facility
§ 117 FOREWORD § 117
FWD:605
shall be constructed within 50 feet of a special geologic feature, without
written permission of the municipality.
11. Stormwater management facilities located outside of existing or
proposed public rights-of-way shall be located within and accessible by
easements granted to the municipality as follows:
A. Drainage Easements. Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement paralleling the centerline of such watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream. The width of the drainage
easement will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded natural flow
of the one-hundred-year storm, in accordance with computed top
widths for water surface elevations. Drainage easements shall
provide for maintenance, and for the purpose of widening,
deepening, improving or protecting such drainage facilities.
B. Access Easements. Where proposed stormwater management
facilities are not adjacent to proposed or existing public rights-ofways
or are not accessible due to physical constraints, as
determined by the municipality, a twenty-foot-wide access
easement specifying rights of entry shall be provided. Access
easements shall provide for vehicle ingress and egress on grades of
less than 10% for carrying out inspection or maintenance activities.
A permanent fifteen-foot-wide vehicular access road within the
easement(s) shall be provided around all SWM BMPs, such as
ponds and infiltration structures. The access roads shall connect to
a public thoroughfare. The access road (when applicable) will also
provide access at a slope no greater than 20% to the bottom of all
ponds and associated outlet structures. The access road shall be
constructed of either gravel or pavement and maintained per the
maintenance agreement. The municipality reserves the right to
alter the design of the access to any SWM BMP. Vehicle ingress and
egress and access roads are not required for SWM BMPs serving
one single-family residential lot and located on the same lot they
serve.
C. Maintenance Easements. A maintenance easement shall be
provided which encompasses the stormwater facility and
appurtenances and provides for access for maintenance purposes.
The maintenance easement must be located at least 20 feet outside
of the line of intersection of the one-hundred-year water surface
elevation and the ground surface for the stormwater facility and
appurtenances.
D. Easements shall state that no trees, shrubs, structures, excavation,
placement of fill, or regrading are to be performed within the
easement without written approval from the municipality upon
review by the municipal engineer. Upon approval of the
municipality, such landscaping may be placed in maintenance
easements, provided it does not impede access.
§ 117 SAINT MARYS CODE § 117
FWD:606
§ 118. Special Protection Watershed Requirements. [Ord. 291, 8/18/
2014]
E. Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel to width and
linked to property lines of the subdivision.
F. All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the site plan. The format and
content of the easement agreement shall be reviewed and
approved by the municipality and Solicitor. The acceptance of a
drainage easement by the City shall not be construed to create any
responsibility on the City to operate or maintain stormwater
management facilities within the easement.
12. Under no circumstances shall roof drains discharge directly to sanitary
sewer systems.
1. Projects that have the potential to discharge into surface waters that
have existing or designated HQ or EV uses (including EV wetlands),
have impairments due to stormwater, are connected to combined sewer
systems, or have the potential to have an adverse effect on threatened
or endangered species, or critical habitat for such species, are subject
to additional BMP measures that must be considered and implemented
for projects occurring in these more environmentally-sensitive areas:
Constructed wetlands/
wet ponds
Significant detention of peak flow rates is
needed and the contributing drainage area
is large; retrofit existing detention basins
are construct new in open median or
interchange areas.
Permeable pavement Limited to park-and-ride sites and parking
lots.
Manufactured products:
Subsurface storage,
water quality inlets, etc.
Subsurface storage products are designed
to temper peak runoff events through
infiltration and/or discharge rate reduction.
Storm sewer inlet structures or inserts are
designed to minimize the discharge of solids,
floatables, and oil/grease pollutants. Regular
maintenance of these products is necessary
and is an important factor in assessing the
feasibility of using one of these products.
2. Proposed infiltration BMPs within two miles on either side of surface
water supply areas or surface waters that have existing or designated
HQ or EV uses (including EV wetlands) must be designed and
constructed to provide maximum pollutant removal prior to the runoff
being infiltrated or discharged to the receiving stream. PA DEP defines
the following zones around such waters:
§ 117 FOREWORD § 118
FWD:607
A. Zone A: Represents a one-quarter-mile buffer on either side of the
river or stream extending from the area 1/4 mile downstream of the
intake upstream to the five-hour time-of-travel (TOT) (Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
B. Zone B: Represents a two-mile buffer on either side of the water
body extending from the area 1/4 mile downstream of the intake
upstream to the twenty-five-hour TOT. (Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, 2006).
C. Zone C: The remainder of the watershed area (Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
3. Groundwater Supply Protection.
A. Zone 1: The innermost protective zone surrounding a well, spring,
or existing infiltrative gallery. Zone 1 is the area within a radius of
400 feet around a community or public water supply source unless
information is presented supporting a reduction of this
requirement. Proposed infiltration BMPs are not permitted within
Zone 1 protection areas (Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, 2006).
B. Zone 2: The capture zone that encompasses the area of the aquifer
through which it supplies water to a well, spring, or existing
infiltration gallery. Zone 2 is the one-half mile radius around a
community or public water supply source unless more extensive
hydrogeological testing is done. Extreme care should be used when
implementing infiltration BMPs in Zone 2 areas. Pretreatment
measures must be used to filter and diminish pollutants
(Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
C. Zone 3: The area outside Zone 2 that contributes significant
recharge to the capture zone aquifer in Zone 2 (Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection, 2006). Use of infiltration
BMPs is not restricted.
D. Infiltration BMPs are not permitted within a radius of 50 feet from
privately owned wells and water sources serving noncommunity
supply systems (Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, 2006).

NOTES:
1 All uses relying upon on-lot sewers are subject to the requirements listed in § 317 of this
chapter.
2 Special setback requirements. Except as provided for in the following paragraph, no area
for the storage or processing of manure, garbage, or spent mushroom compost, structures for
the cultivation of mushrooms or the raising of commercial livestock, nor any building housing
commercial livestock shall be permitted within 200 feet of any adjoining property. The Zoning
Hearing Board may, as a special exception, however, reduce the above special setback
requirements where it is shown that, because of prevailing winds, unusual obstructions,
topography, or other conditions, a lesser distance would protect adjoining lands from odor,
dust, or other hazards. In no case, however, shall the Zoning Hearing Board reduce the
special setback to less than 100 feet. The burden shall be upon the applicant to prove that
a lesser distance would not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of the
community.
6. Maximum permitted height:
A. Principal buildings and structures: 35 feet.
B. Accessory buildings and structures: 25 feet.
7. Agricultural nuisance disclaimer. Lands within the Rural Conservation
Zone are located within an area where land is used for commercial
agricultural production. Owners, residents, and other users of this
property may be subjected to inconvenience, discomfort, and the
possibility of injury to property and health arising from normal and
accepted agricultural practices and operations, including but not
limited to noise, odors, dust, the operation of machinery of any kind,
including aircraft, the storage and disposal of manure, the application
of fertilizers, soil amendments, herbicides and pesticides. Owners,
occupants, and users of this property should be prepared to accept such
inconveniences, discomfort, and possibility of injury from normal
agricultural operations and are hereby put on official notice that

bar them from obtaining a legal judgment against such normal
agricultural operations.
8. Required conservation plan. Any agricultural, horticultural or forestry
uses which involve earthmoving activities or the commercial harvesting
or timbering of vegetation shall require the obtainment of an approved
conservation plan by the Elk County Conservation District pursuant to
Chapter 102, Erosion Control, of Title 25, Rules and Regulations, of the
Department of Environmental Protection. All on-site activities shall
then be in compliance with the approved conservation plan.
9. All uses permitted within this zone shall also comply with all applicable
general provisions contained within Part 3 of this chapter.
1. Purpose. The purpose of this zone is to reflect and permit a continued
suburban development pattern with lower densities and detached
housing units. Because areas within this zone may or may not have
access to public utilities, design standards vary depending upon those
public utilities utilized. In addition, where dwelling units are
constructed in an area planned for public sewer service that precedes
sewer installation, such lots will be required to employ utility infill
designs and capped sewer lines. Uses permitted within this zone are
limited to complement suburban neighborhoods, with accessory uses
that will not detract from the residential character.
2. Permitted uses:
A. Agricultural, horticultural and forestry uses, excluding
concentrated animal feeding operations subject to the standards
listed in § 200 of this chapter.
B. Single-family detached dwellings.
C. Municipal services, parks and playgrounds.
D. Public and private schools.
E. Churches, cemeteries and related uses.
F. Public utility structures.
G. No-impact home-based businesses.
H. Accessory uses customarily incidental and secondary to the above
permitted uses, including but not limited to no-impact home-based
businesses and accessory day-care uses, as defined herein.47
3. Special exception uses (see § 604, Subsection 3):

§ 222. through § 229. (Reserved)
§ 230. Floodplain Overlay Zone (FP). [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
19. All uses permitted within this zone shall also comply with the applicable
general provisions in Part 3 of this chapter.
1. Purpose. It is hereby found that the streams, creeks and waterways of
the City are subject to recurring flooding, that such flooding damages
and endangers life and public and private property and facilities, that
this condition is aggravated by developments and encroachments in the
floodplain, and that the most appropriate method of alleviating such
condition is through regulation of such developments and
encroachments. It is therefore determined that the special and
paramount public interest in the floodplain justifies the regulation of
property located therein as provided in this section, which is in the
exercise of the police power of the municipality, for the protection of the
persons and property of its inhabitants, and for the preservation of the
public health, safety and general welfare.
2. Specific objectives:
A. To combine with present zoning requirements certain restrictions
made necessary for flood-prone areas to promote the general
health, welfare and safety of the City.
B. To prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage
by reason of danger from flooding.
C. To minimize danger to public health by protecting the quality and
quantity of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and
underlying flood-prone areas and promoting safe and sanitary
drainage.
D. To permit only those uses which can be appropriately located in the
floodplain, as herein defined, and which will not impede the flow or
storage of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and
property at, above, or below their locations along the floodplains.
E. To provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows or
stormwater in periods of heavy precipitation.
F. To protect adjacent landowners and those both upstream and
downstream from damages resulting from development within a
floodplain and the consequent obstruction or increase in flow of
floodwaters.
G. To protect the entire City from individual uses of land which may
have an effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works and
disaster relief and adversely affect the economic well-being of the
City.
§ 221 FOREWORD § 230
FWD:717
H. To protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the
impact of improper development and the consequent increased
potential for flooding.
I. To provide areas for the temporary natural storage of floodwaters.
J. To require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities,
be constructed so as to be protected from flood damage in
accordance with the purpose and requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 93-234.
K. To comply with the federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
3. Delineation of lands within the Floodplain Overlay Zone. For purposes
of this chapter, areas contained within the Floodplain Overlay Zone
shall include the following:
A. Any area located in the former Township of Benzinger subject to
the one-hundred-year flood, which is identified as a special flood
hazard area, Zone A or Zone AE, on the Flood Insurance Map
(FIRM) as issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), dated January 18, 2012, or as may be revised by that
agency or its successor. [Amended by Ord. 268, 11/7/2011]
B. In addition, the General Floodplain District (FA) shall be any area
located in the former Borough of St. Marys subject to the onehundred-
year flood, which is identified as a special flood hazard
area, Zone A, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), dated
January 18, 2012, as issued by the Federal Insurance
Administration, or as may be revised by that agency or its
successor. [Amended by Ord. 268, 11/7/2011]
C. In lieu of §§ 230, Subsection 3A, B and C, the City may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Such study shall be signed, sealed and
certified by a registered professional of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Such certification shall acknowledge the accuracy of
the study or survey and the qualification of the individual to
perform such study or survey. Copies of such studies and surveys
shall be submitted by the Zoning Officer to the City Engineer and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who shall have 30
days to comment. Any property owner whose property is so studied
shall pay all costs of these studies and surveys, except for work
done under retainer to, or on behalf of, the City.
D. Description of floodplain areas. The identified floodplain area shall
consist of the following specific areas: [Amended by Ord. 268,
11/7/2011]
(1) FW (Floodway Area). The areas identified as "floodway" in the
A Zone or AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Studies, dated
§ 230 SAINT MARYS CODE § 230
FWD:718
January 18, 2012, prepared by FIA or FEMA. The term shall
also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those floodplain
areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood
Insurance Study. For the purposes of this Part, the floodway is
based upon the criteria that a certain area within the floodplain
would be capable of carrying the waters of the one-hundredyear
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of
that flood more than one foot at any point.
(2) FF (Flood-Fringe Area). The remaining portions of the onehundred-
year floodplain in those areas identified as an A or AE
Zone in the Flood Insurance Studies, dated January 18, 2012,
where a floodway has been delineated. The basis for the
outermost boundary of this area shall be the one-hundred-year
flood elevations as shown in the flood profiles contained in the
flood studies.
(3) FE (Special Floodplain Area). The areas identified as Zone A or
AE in the Flood Insurance Studies, dated January 18, 2012,
where one-hundred-year flood elevations have been provided
but no floodway has been delineated. New development shall
not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of all past and projected development will not increase
the base flood elevation by more than one foot.
(4) FA (General Floodplain Area). The areas identified as Zone A in
the FEMA Flood Insurance Study, dated January 18, 2012, for
which no one-hundred-year flood elevations have been
provided. When available, information from other federal, state
and other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the
one-hundred-year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if
possible. When no other information is available, the onehundred-
year elevation shall be determined by using a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest
the construction site in question. In lieu of the above, the City
may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic or hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses computations, etc., shall be submitted in
§ 230 FOREWORD § 230
FWD:719
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
City of St. Marys, Elk County, Pennsylvania.
4. Boundary disputes.
A. Should a dispute concerning any boundary of the Floodplain
Overlay Zone arise, the initial determination of the Zoning Officer
may be appealed to the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with
§ 604, Subsection 6, of this chapter. The burden of proof in such an
appeal shall be on the applicant, and all hearings and procedures
shall follow the requirements of § 603 of this chapter.
B. All changes to the boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay Zone which
affect areas identified in § 230, Subsection 3A, of this chapter are
subject to the review and approval of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency for compliance with the rules and regulations
of the National Flood Insurance Program and Pennsylvania Act
166, the Pennsylvania Floodplain Management Act. Technical or
scientific data shall be submitted by the applicant to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for a letter of map revision
(LOMR) as soon as practicable but within six months of any new
construction, development or other activity resulting in changes to
the base flood elevation. [Amended by Ord. 268, 11/7/2011]
5. Relationship to other sections. The provisions of this section create an
overlay zoning district which is applicable within floodplains in all other
zoning districts established by this chapter and the Zoning Map. To the
extent that the provisions of this section are applicable and more
restrictive, they shall supersede conflicting provisions within all other
sections of this chapter and all other ordinances of the City. However,
all other provisions of all other sections of this chapter and all other
ordinances of the City shall remain in full force. If there is any conflict
between any of the provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall
apply. [Amended by Ord. 268, 11/7/2011]
6. Permitted uses. The following uses and development and no others are
permitted in the Floodplain Overlay Zone, provided that such uses in no
way diminish the capacity of the channels or floodway of any stream, as
defined herein, or raise the base flood elevation:

9. Nonconforming uses and structures in the Floodplain Overlay Zone.
A. Continuation. All uses, structures or development lawfully existing
in the Floodplain Overlay Zone on the effective date of this section
which are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter shall
be deemed nonconforming uses or structures. Such nonconforming
uses or structures may be continued, maintained, repaired, and
floodproofed, except as prohibited by § 230, Subsections 9B and
9D(2), of this chapter. However, such nonconforming uses or
structures may at any time be improved to comply with existing
state or City health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
are necessary solely to assure safe living conditions.
B. Abandonment. Nonconforming uses or structures which have been
discontinued or vacated for 12 consecutive months shall be
considered abandoned. Vacation of land or structures or the
nonoperative status of the use normally carried on by the property
shall be evidence of discontinuance. No abandoned use or
structure may be reestablished, repaired, or reoccupied. The
Council may require the removal of any abandoned nonconforming
use or structure upon prior notice to the owner of the property on
which an abandoned nonconforming use or structure exists. If the
owner has not completely removed the abandoned use or structure
within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed nine months, the
Council shall have the authority to cause the removal to be
accomplished, the costs of such removal to be paid by the property
owner.
C. Expansion and modification. A nonconforming use or structure
shall not be expanded or modified in any manner which would
increase or aggravate flooding or flood hazards. Nothing shall be
done which would otherwise violate any of the provisions of this
section. No nonconforming use or structure shall be expanded,
enlarged, or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity
with respect to height, area, yard, and other requirements
established in other sections of this chapter nor in any way which
causes it to occupy more space within the Floodplain Overlay Zone
than was occupied by it on the effective date of this chapter.
§ 230 FOREWORD § 230
FWD:723
D. Replacement and rebuilding.
(1) A nonconforming use or structure may be replaced, repaired or
rebuilt if it is damaged or destroyed by any means, including
floods, to the extent of less than 50% of its fair market value at
the time of its damage or destruction. In such a case, however,
the nonconformity of the new use or structure with respect to
requirements as expressed in the provisions of this chapter
shall not exceed that of the original use or structure which was
damaged or destroyed. Nothing shall be done which would
otherwise violate any of the provisions of this section.
(2) A nonconforming use or structure which has been damaged or
destroyed by any means, including floods, to the extent of 50%
or more of its fair market value at the time of its damage or

reconstructed, improved, or rebuilt in any way other than in
complete conformity and full compliance with § 230,
Subsection 11C, and all other sections of this chapter and all
other ordinances of the City. The Zoning Hearing Board may
waive, as a special exception, the requirements of this
subsection where it is shown that such requirements could not
be met on land owned by the appellant or where such
requirements would impose undue hardship to the appellant in
the efficient operations of the premises. In such a case, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall be authorized to grant only the
minimum relief necessary, and the least modification possible
of the provisions of this section, while respecting and
maintaining the purpose and intent of this section.
(3) The Zoning Officer shall have the initial responsibility of
determining the percent of damage or destruction and the fair
market value of the damaged or destroyed use or structure at
the time of its damage or destruction and may call on any
experts or authorities he may deem necessary to assist him in
arriving at a fair and impartial determination. Appeals of the
decision of the Zoning Officer may be made to the Zoning
Hearing Board.
(4) Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement
of any kind to an existing structure, to an extent or amount of
less than 50% of its fair market value, shall be elevated and/or
floodproofed to the greatest extent possible.

base flood elevation, unless specifically authorized by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
C. In addition to the standards generally applicable to variances,
variances shall only be granted upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in an increase in the base flood level unless hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses prove that the proposed encroachment
would not increase flood levels during the base flood
discharge, create additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with any other
applicable laws, ordinances or regulations.
D. Variances shall only be granted upon the determination that the
variances are the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering
the flood hazard. The applicant must also comply with any other
conditions imposed by the Zoning Hearing Board.
E. Whenever a variance is granted, the Board shall notify the
applicant, in writing, that:
(1) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance if construction occurs below the onehundred-
year flood elevation.
(2) Such variance may increase the risk to life and property.
F. In granting a special exception or variance, the Board shall require
that all buildings and structures shall be designed and constructed
so as to have the capability of resisting the one-hundred-year flood.
G. A complete record of all variance requests and actions, including
justifications for granted variances, shall be maintained by the
Board. The Board shall report such decisions in the annual report
sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

related matters, such as the adequacy of hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses being performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices.
12. Municipal liability. [Amended by Ord. 268, 11/7/2011]
A. The lawful granting of a permit or making of any administrative
decision under this section shall not constitute a representation,
guaranty, or warranty of any kind by the City of Saint Mary's, or by
any official, agent, or employee thereof, of the practicability or
safety of any structure, use, or other plan proposed with respect to
damage from flood or otherwise and shall create no liability upon,
or a cause of action against, such public body, official, agent, or
employee for any flood damage that may result pursuant thereto or
as a result of reliance on this section. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes
such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted by debris. There is
also no assurance that lands not included in the Floodplain Overlay
Zone are now or ever will be free from flooding or flood damage.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of St.
Marys or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
1. Purpose. In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are
hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the
land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces,
horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to the St. Marys
Area Airport. Such zones are shown on the St. Marys Area Airport
Zoning District Map, which is attached to this chapter and made a part
hereof.67 An area located in more than one of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more-restrictive height
limitation.
2. Various airport zones. The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:
A. Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
67.Editor's Note: The Airport Zoning District Map is on file in the City offices.
§ 230 FOREWORD § 231
FWD:733
1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the
runway.
B. Utility Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000
feet from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of
the center line of the runway.
C. Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zones. The inner edge
of this zone approach coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly
to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from
the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center
line of the runway.
D. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum Greater
Than Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach
Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the
width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach
zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway.
E. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum As Low As
Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands
outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance
of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its center line is the
continuation of the center line of the runway.
F. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface
and is 1,000 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the
primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line
of the runway.
G. Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
H. Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designed utility or visual and
10,000 feet for all others from the center of each runway and
connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those
arcs. The horizontal zones do not include the approach and
transitional zones.
§ 231 SAINT MARYS CODE § 231
FWD:734
I. Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends
outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
3. Airport zone height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained and no tree
shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a height
in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for each of
the zones in question as follows:
A. Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway center line.
B. Utility Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes
20 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and
at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway center
line.
C. Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet
outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway center
line.
D. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum Greater
Than Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach
Zone. Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at
the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway center line.
E. Runway Larger Than Utility With a Visibility Minimum As Low As
Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone.
Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end
of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending
to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway
center line.
F. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes 50 feet
outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway
center line; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot
vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along
the extended runway center line.
G. Transitional Zones. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot
upward, beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and the approach surface, extending to a height of
§ 231 FOREWORD § 231
FWD:735
150 feet above the airport elevation, which is 1,937 feet above
mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, when an airport has a
precision instrument runway approach zone, there are established
height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward,
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects
beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping
seven feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the sides of
and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending
a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet, measured at 90° angles to the
extended runway center line.
H. Horizontal Zone. Established at 150 feet above the established
airport elevation, or at a height of 2,087 feet above mean sea level.
I. Conical Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward,
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface and at 150 feet
above the established airport elevation, and extending to a height
of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
J. Expected height limitations. Nothing in this section shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any
structure or growth of any tree to a height up to 50 feet above the
surface of the land.
4. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this
chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or
otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
5. Nonconforming uses.
A. Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or
other change or alteration of any structure or trees not conforming
to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter nor
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming
use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective
date of this chapter and which is diligently executed.
B. Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or
tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon or nearby of such markers and lights as shall
§ 231 SAINT MARYS CODE § 231
FWD:736
be deemed necessary by the Airport Manager to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence
of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the airport.
6. Permits and variances.
A. Future uses. Except as specifically provided in Subsection 6A, B or
C hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land,
no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree
shall be planted in any zone hereby created by this section unless a
permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each
application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the
permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would
conform to the regulations herein prescribed. No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with this
section.
(1) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for zones.
(2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such approach zones.
(3) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such transition zones. Nothing contained in any of the
foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or
intending to permit any construction or alteration of any
structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height
limits established by this section, except as set forth by § 231,
Subsection 3J, of this chapter.
B. Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a
nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to
§ 231 FOREWORD § 231
FWD:737
air navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter, or
any amendment thereto, or than it is when the application for a
permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a
permit shall be granted.
C. Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the
Zoning Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure
has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would
allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from this section.
D. Variances.
(1) Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the
height of any structure or permit the growth of any object of
natural growth or otherwise use his property in violation of
airport zoning regulations may apply to the St. Marys Zoning
Hearing Board for a variance from the zoning regulations in
question.
(2) The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation
facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and relief (if) granted will not be
contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air
navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in
accordance with the spirit of this section. Additionally, no
application for variance to the requirements of this section may
be considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of
the application has been furnished to the Airport Manager for
advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the
Airport Manager does not respond to the application within 15
days after receipt, the Zoning Hearing Board may act to grant
or deny said application.
E. Marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such
action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this
chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditional
as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such
markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the
Zoning Hearing Board, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the St. Marys Area Airport, at its own expense,
to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

5. Alternative energy sources. Except for those contained on farms, wind
energy conversion systems (WECS) shall not be permitted in the front
yard area of any property, unless such units are set back at least 100
feet from the nearest property line. Height regulations do not apply to
WECS units, provided that the height of the WECS unit shall not be
greater than the shortest distance measured along a horizontal plane
from the unit to any lot line and that such WECS units comply with
§ 231 of this chapter. WECS units may be placed on the roof of any
§ 301 SAINT MARYS CODE § 301
FWD:740
structure, provided that the perimeter of the unit does not cover 25%
of the roof area of the structure on which the WECS unit is placed. The
additional height extension shall be so positioned that the height of the
WECS unit above the roof is less than the distance measured along a
horizontal plane from such unit to any lot line. All transmission lines
to and from any freestanding WECS unit or any supporting building
or structure shall be buried underground. Solar energy units shall be
permitted in any zone and shall be subject to the requirements of that
zone.

exceeding the requirements of this section shall be considered as
"man-made lakes, dams and impoundments" and are subject to the
criteria listed in § 301, Subsection 7, of this chapter.
C. No such impoundment shall have a length or diameter exceeding
15 feet nor a maximum depth exceeding 1 1/2 feet.
D. All such ponds or pools shall be maintained so as to not pose a
nuisance by reason of odor or the harboring of insects.
E. No such pond(s) shall be used for the commercial hatching of fish
or other species.
7. Man-made lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments. All lakes, dams,
ponds, and impoundments may be permitted in any zone, subject to the
following:
A. Lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments located along and
connected to a stream.
(1) All lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments located along and
connected to a stream that involve any of the following shall
require a permit from the PA DEP, Bureau of Dams and
Waterways, Division of Dam Safety, or a letter indicating that
the proposed use does not require a PA DEP permit:
(a) The lake, dam, pond, or impoundment contains a volume of
at least 50 acre feet.
(b) The dam reaches a height of 15 feet.
(c) The lake, dam, pond, or impoundment impounds the water
from a watershed of at least 100 acres.
(2) All such lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments shall be
located 75 feet from all adjoining lot lines, as measured from
§ 301 FOREWORD § 301
FWD:741
the closest point of the adjoining property line to the maximum
anticipated water surface elevation.
B. All lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments not contiguous to a
stream that have an intake, outlet, or both, and/or have an
embankment within 50 feet of a stream shall require the
obtainment of a permit from the PA DEP Bureau of Dams and
Waterways, Division of Waterways and Stormwater Management.
C. All other lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments require the
submission of a statement and seal by a qualified engineer that the
proposed use is properly constructed and will not pose a threat to
the public safety nor the environment during normal flow
conditions and those associated with the base flood. All dams shall
be constructed to a height of one foot above the water surface
elevation occurring during the base flood.
D. All lakes, dams, ponds, and impoundments, including stormwater
management basins, shall be located a minimum of 50 feet from

walking distance between vehicles and each of the shopping
center's stores.
B. Required parking spaces may be provided in parking lots
designated to jointly serve two or more establishments or uses,
provided that the number of required spaces in such joint facility
shall not be less than the total required separately for all such
establishments or uses. However, where it can be conclusively
demonstrated that one or more uses will be generating a demand
for parking spaces primarily during periods when the other use(s)
is(are) not in operation, the total number of required parking
spaces may be reduced to:
(1) That required number of spaces that would be needed to serve
the use generating the most demand for parking; plus.
(2) Twenty percent of that number of required parking spaces
needed to serve the use(s) generating the demand for lesser
spaces.

1. Yard ground cover. Any part of the site which is not used for buildings,
other structures, loading or parking spaces and aisles, sidewalks, and
designated storage areas shall be planted with an all-season ground
cover approved by the City Council (e.g., grass, mulch, ivy,
pachysandra, etc.). In addition, gravel can be substituted if done in a
manner to complement other vegetative materials. It shall be
maintained to provide an attractive appearance, and all non-surviving
plants shall be replaced promptly.
2. Landscaping requirements.
A. Any required landscaping (landscape strips and interior
landscaping) shall include a combination of the following elements:
deciduous trees, ground covers, evergreens, shrubs, vines, flowers,
rocks, gravel, earth mounds, berms, walls, fences, screens,
sculptures, fountains, sidewalk furniture, or other approved
materials. Artificial plants, trees and shrubs may not be used to
satisfy any requirement for landscaping or screening. No less than
80% of the required landscape area shall be vegetative in
composition, and no outdoor storage shall be permitted within
required landscape areas.
B. For each 750 square feet of required area for landscape strips, one
shade/ornamental tree shall be provided. If deciduous, these trees
shall have a clear trunk at least five feet above finished grade; if
evergreen, these trees shall have a minimum height of six feet. All
required landscape strips shall have landscaping materials
distributed along the entire length of the lot line abutting the yard.
3. Screening. The following materials may be used: evergreens (trees,
hedges or shrubs), walls, fences, earth berms, or other approved similar
§ 313 SAINT MARYS CODE § 314

§ 315. Outdoor Signs. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006; as amended by Ord.
261, 10/18/2010, §§ 2, 3]
materials. Fences and walls shall not be constructed of corrugated
metal, corrugated fiberglass or sheet metal. Screening shall be
arranged so as to block the ground-level views between grade and a
height of six feet. Landscape screens must achieve this visual blockage
within two years of installation.
4. Selection of plant materials.
A. Trees and shrubs shall be typical of their species and variety and
have normal growth habits, well-developed branches, dense
foliage, and vigorous, fibrous root systems. They shall have been
grown under climatic conditions similar to those in the locality of
the project or properly acclimated to conditions of the locality of
the project.
B. Any tree or shrub which dies shall be replaced so as to maintain
ground cover and/or screening. All landscaping and screening
treatments shall be properly maintained.
1. General regulations for all signs.
A. Signs must be constructed of durable material and maintained in
good condition.
B. No sign shall be maintained within the City in such a state of
disrepair as to have the appearance of complete neglect, which is
rotting or falling down, which is illegible, or which has loose parts
separated from original fastenings.
C. Whenever a sign becomes structurally unsafe or endangers the
safety of the building or premises, or endangers public safety, the
Zoning Officer shall give written notice to the owner of the
premises on which the sign is located that such sign be made safe
or removed within five days.
D. Advertising painted upon or displayed upon a barn or other
building or structure shall be regarded as a flat wall sign, and the
regulations pertaining thereto shall apply.
E. Each sign shall be removed when the circumstances leading to its
erection no longer apply.
F. Signs may be interior-lighted with nonglaring lights or may be
illuminated by floodlights or spotlights. If illuminated by floodlights
or spotlights, they must be downward facing and shielded so there
is no direct light transmitted to other properties or public rights-ofway.
[Amended by Ord. No. 314, 11/18/2019]
G. No sign shall be of the intermittent flashing or rotating type.
§ 314 FOREWORD § 315
FWD:775
H. No sign located within 300 feet of any traffic light shall be
illuminated with red, green or yellow lights or neon tubing.
I. All electrically illuminated signs shall be constructed to the
standards of the National Board of Fire Underwriters.
J. Signs must be positioned so that they do not interfere with any
clear sight triangle.
K. Determination of size. The area of a sign shall be construed to
include all lettering, wording and accompanying designs and
symbols, together with the background, whether open or enclosed,
on which they are displayed, including any border framing or
decorative attachments, but not including any supporting
framework or bracing incidental to the display itself. Where the
sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to a building,
wall or window, the area of the sign shall be considered to be that of
the smallest rectangle or other regular geometric shape which
encompasses all of the letters and symbols. Where a sign has two or
more faces, the area of all faces shall be included in determining
the area of the sign; provided, however, that for a double-face sign,
if the interior angle formed by the two faces of the double-face sign
is less than 45° and the two faces are at no point more than three
feet from one another, the area of only the larger face shall be
included.
L. No lewd, vulgar, indecent, or obscene advertising matter shall be
displayed in any manner, including but not limited to:
(1) Acts or simulated acts of sexual intercourse, masturbation,
sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, or any sexual
acts which are prohibited by law.
(2) Scenes wherein a person displays the vulva or the anus or
other genitals.
§ 315 SAINT MARYS CODE § 315
FWD:776
(3) Scenes wherein artificial devices are employed to depict, or
drawings are employed to portray, any of the prohibited signs,
photographs or graphic representations described above.
(4) Any other graphic illustration pertaining to specified sexual
activities and/or specified anatomical areas.
M. No sign shall be erected or located as to prevent free ingress or
egress from any window, door or fire escape.
N. No sign shall be placed in such a position that it will obscure light
or air from a building or which would create a traffic danger.
O. No permanent sign shall be erected within the right-of-way of any
street. [Amended by Ord. 279, 1/21/2013]
P. No sign located within any floodplain shall exceed six square feet of
area per side.
Q. In the event that a symbol, trademark or other such figure is used
as a signpost or standard which could be construed to indicate or
identify a particular use or business, that symbol, trademark or
figure is to be computed as part of the total allowable sign area.
R. Except in the cases of billboards, as regulated by § 315.2, and offpremises
advertising signs, off-premises directional signs,
sponsorship signs, and multibusiness signs, as regulated by § 315.2
and this Subsection, only those signs referring directly to materials
or products made, sold or displayed on the premises, to services
offered on the premises, and/or to activities conducted on the
premises, shall be permitted. Off-premises advertising signs, offpremises
directional signs, and sponsorship signs shall all be
included in the aggregate square footage allowed per premises as
provided for herein. Where there is more than one business located
on the premises, the maximum sign area permitted is 200 square
feet per premises, not per business, but in any ratio.
S. Except in the case of billboards and school bus shelters, all signs
must relate to a use or activity that is located and/or conducted
within City of Saint Marys.
T. All signs, except permitted temporary signs as specifically
regulated by this § 315, shall be affixed at a permanent and
stationary location.
U. Temporary signs in right-of-way. [Added by Ord. 279, 1/21/2013]
(1) No temporary sign shall be erected within the right-of-way of
any public street if:
(a) The sign interferes with or obstructs the flow and safety of
traffic; or
§ 315 FOREWORD § 315
FWD:777
(b) The property owner abutting the place within the right-ofway
where the sign is erected objects to placement of the
sign.
(2) City shall have the right to remove any sign violating this
subsection without prior notice to the owner of the sign.
2. Specific standards. The following tables present specific standards
imposed upon permanent and temporary signs, respectively.74
3. All signs requiring the obtainment of a permit (as listed in the
preceding tables) shall be required to submit building permit
applications that include scaled plans or diagrams showing the
following:
A. Exact dimensions of the lot, including any right-of-way lines or
building upon which the sign is proposed to be erected.
B. Exact size, dimensions and location of the said sign on the lot or
building, together with its type, construction, materials to be used,
and the manner of installation.
C. Any other lawful information which may be required of the
applicant by the Zoning Officer.

§ 317. Zoning Requirements for Use of On-Lot Sewage Disposal
Systems. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
4. Application for a permit shall be made in writing to the Zoning Officer
and shall contain all information necessary for such Officer to
determine whether the proposed sign or the proposed alterations
conform to all the requirements of this chapter.
5. No sign permit shall be issued except in conformity with the regulations
of this chapter, except upon order of the Zoning Hearing Board, granted
pursuant to the procedures established for the issuance of a variance.
1. Except for those nonconforming lots described in § 507 of this chapter
and as noted below in § 317, Subsection 5, of this chapter, as of the
effective date of this chapter, all future uses that rely upon on-lot
sewage disposal systems shall be required to specifically test for and
secure one disposal site (field, bed, or trench) and replacement area.
Both disposal sites shall be approved by the Sewage Enforcement
Officer. Furthermore, the alternate disposal site shall be perpetually
protected from excavation, construction, and other activities that would
result in disturbance of the soil's ability to renovate sewage effluent,
§ 315 FOREWORD § 317
FWD:779
§ 318. Operations and Performance Standards. [Ord. 227, 12/18/
2006]
All uses proposed within City of Saint Marys shall operate in compliance
with applicable state and federal regulations, as they are periodically
amended. The following lists City-devised standards and known
governmental regulations associated with various land use impacts or
specific requirements imposed by this chapter. This list in no way excludes
or limits federal or state jurisdiction over uses within the City.
until such time as the alternate field is activated due to malfunction of
the initial disposal site.
2. Regardless of any maximum lot area requirements listed elsewhere in
this chapter, the minimum required lot size may be increased to ensure
an acceptable level of nitrate-nitrogen in the adjoining groundwaters.
Such determinations will be made by the PA DEP, through its sewer
module review process. In those cases where applicable maximum lot
area requirements are exceeded to protect groundwater quality, the
applicant shall furnish evidence that the amount of land needed to
protect local groundwater is the minimum necessary for such
protection.
3. Every use relying upon on-lot sewage disposal systems shall be
required to properly maintain and repair such systems in accordance
with the City's on-lot disposal system management program.
4. Every use relying upon an on-lot sewage disposal system shall be
required to comply with the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act, Act
537, as may be amended.75
5. In those areas that have been officially identified by the City as future
public sewer service areas, anyone who develops a parcel for
residential purposes prior to the actual installation and connection of
public sewers will be required to employ utility infill design as
regulated in § 201 of this chapter. Furthermore, any parcel improved
shall also require the installation of capped sewer lines along the
property frontage(s) in accordance with the City's prevailing design
standards prior to the issuance of a certificate of use and occupancy.
A. Noise.
(1) Except for agricultural, horticultural and forestry-related uses, no
use shall regularly generate exterior noise levels in excess of those
listed in the following table:
75.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq.

standards, that ambient noise level shall become the maximum
permitted noise level at that location. The maximum permitted
noise level shall be applied to regularly occurring uses and
activities; short-term temporary noises and infrequent
instantaneous noises may be permitted at noise levels 20 dBA
higher than the above-described standards, but only between 7:00
a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
B. Glare and light.
(1) All on-site lighting shall be provided within the following ranges for
periods when the use is in operation and shall be, except as noted

§ 319. Common Open Space Requirements. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
In those instances where open space is required elsewhere in this chapter,
or when an applicant proposes the use of open space, such open space shall
comply with the following:
On-Site Area
Range of Required
Illumination
footcandles
Building facades, monuments,
fountains, signs, architectural
features, and similar objects

commercial, and industrial
uses
1.0 to 5.0
(2) In all zones, exterior lighting of a building and/or grounds for
security surveillance purposes is permitted. Such lighting shall be
arranged and of sufficient illumination to enable the detection of
suspicious movement rather than the recognition of definitive
detail. For security lighting of grounds and parking lots, the level of
illumination shall not exceed one footcandle. Security lighting for
buildings/structures shall be directed toward the face of the
building/structure, rather than the area around it, and shall not
exceed five footcandles.
(3) In all zones, all exterior lighting provided in conjunction with any
nonresidential or nonfarm use shall be hooded and/or screened so
as not to permit the source of illumination nor lenses to be seen
from off of the premises.
(4) Adequate lighting shall be provided in parking lots and loading
areas that will be used at night. The primary lighting sources shall
be pole-mounted fixtures, not building-mounted fixtures. The
maximum height of lighting standards shall not exceed the
maximum permitted height of principal buildings or 20 feet,
whichever is less.

§ 318 SAINT MARYS CODE § 319
FWD:782
A. Required common open space shall be designed and arranged to
achieve at least one of the following objectives, and the applicant shall
demonstrate those specific measures employed to achieve these
objectives:
(1) Protection of important natural resources (e.g., streams, ponds,
wetlands, steep slopes, woodlands, unique geologic features,
wildlife habitats, aquifer recharge areas, etc.).
(2) Protection of important historical and/or archaeological sites.
(3) Provision of usable play and recreation areas that are conveniently
accessible to residents within the development and the City.
(4) Integration of greenbelts throughout the development that link
residences with on-site or adjoining parks, schools, or other similar
features.
B. An essential element of the use of common open space is a written
description and plan for the disposition of ownership of common open
space land, designating those areas to be offered for dedication or to be
owned by the specific form of organization proposed. The permanent
preservation of common open space shall be accomplished through one
of the following:
(1) An offer of dedication to the City. The City shall not be obligated to
accept dedication of the common open space.
(2) With permission of the City, and with appropriate deed restrictions
in favor of the City and in language acceptable to the City Solicitor,
the developer may transfer ownership of the common open space
or a portion thereof to a private, nonprofit organization among
whose purposes is the preservation of common open space land
and/or natural resources. The organization shall be a bona fide
conservation organization with a perpetual existence, the
conveyance must contain appropriate provision for reverter or
retransfer if the organization is unable to maintain the land, and
the organization must enter into a maintenance agreement with the
City.
(3) The developer shall provide for and establish an organization for
the ownership and maintenance of the common open space, which
shall be generally consistent with the requirements for unit owners'
associations found in the Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act,
68 Pa.C.S.A. § 3101 et seq. If such an organization is created, the
agreements of sale and deeds for all lots shall contain the following
requirements, in language acceptable to the City Solicitor:
(a) Such organization shall not dispose of the common open space
by sale or otherwise, except to the City, unless the City has
given prior written approval. Such transfer shall be made only
§ 319 FOREWORD § 319
FWD:783
§ 320. Required Traffic Impact Reports. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
to another organization which shall maintain the common open
space in accordance with this chapter.
(b) The organization and all lot owners shall enter into a
maintenance agreement with the City and shall agree to be
bound by the provisions of Article VII of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code76 relating to the maintenance of
deteriorating common open space by municipalities.
(c) The City may require the establishment of a reserve fund to
provide for maintenance of or capital improvements to the
common open space.
(d) The common open space shall be restricted in perpetuity from
development and subdivision
1. Applicability. For those uses requiring a traffic study, the following
requirements are applicable.
2. Traffic impact study.
A. Area of traffic impact study. The traffic impact study area shall be
based on the characteristics of the surrounding area. The
intersections to be included in the study shall be adjacent to the
site or have direct impact upon the access to the site. The
intersections shall be mutually agreed upon by the municipalities in
which the proposed project is located and the traffic engineer
preparing the study. The County Planning Commission shall be
called upon to resolve any disputes between the municipality and
the engineer.
B. Preparation by transportation engineer required. Traffic impact
studies shall be prepared under the supervision of qualified and
experienced transportation engineers with specific training in
traffic and transportation engineering and at least two years of
experience related to preparing traffic studies for existing or
proposed developments.
C. Horizon year. The traffic forecasts shall be prepared for the
anticipated opening year of the development, assuming full buildout
and occupancy. This year shall be referred to as the "horizon
year" in the remainder of this section.
D. Non-site traffic estimates. Estimates of non-site traffic shall be
made and will consist of through traffic and traffic generated by all
other developments within the study area for which preliminary or
final plans have been approved. Non-site traffic may be estimated
using any one of the following three methods: build-up technique,
76.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10701 et seq.
§ 319 SAINT MARYS CODE § 320
FWD:784
area transportation plan data or modeled volumes, and trends or
growth rates.
E. Trip generation rates required. The traffic impact study report shall
include a table showing the categories and quantities of land uses,
with the corresponding trip generation rates or equations (with
justification for selection of one or the other) and resulting number
of trips. The trip generation rates used must be either from the
latest edition of Trip Generation by the American Institute of Traffic
Engineers (ITE) or from a local study of corresponding land uses
and quantities. All sources must be referenced in the study.
F. Consideration of pass-by trips. If pass-by trips or shared trips are a
major consideration for the land use in question, studies and
interviews at similar land uses must be conducted or referenced.
G. Rate sums. Any significant difference between the sums of singleuse
rates and proposed mix-use estimates must be justified in the
study report.
H. Explanations required. The reasoning and data used in developing
a trip generation rate for special/unusual generators must be
justified and explained in the report.
I. Definition of influence area.
(1) Prior to trip distribution of site-generated trips, an influence
area must be defined which contains 80% or more of the trip
ends that will be attracted to the development. A market study
can be used to establish the limits of an influence area, if
available. If no market study is available, an influence area
should be estimated based on a reasonable documented
estimate. The influence area can also be based on a reasonable
maximum convenient travel time to the site or delineating area
boundaries based on locations of competing developments.
(2) Other methods, such as using trip data from an existing
development with similar characteristics or using an existing
origin-destination survey of trips within the area, can be used
in place of the influence area to delineate the boundaries of the
impact.
J. Estimates of trip distribution required.
(1) Trip distribution can be estimated using any one of the
following three methods:
(a) Analogy.
(b) Trip distribution model.
(c) Surrogate data.
§ 320 FOREWORD § 320
FWD:785
(2) Whichever method is used, trip distribution must be estimated
and analyzed for the horizon year. A multi-use development
may require more than one distribution and coinciding
assignment for each phase (for example, residential and retail
phases on the same site). Consideration must also be given to
whether inbound and outbound trips will have similar
distributions.
K. Trip assignments.
(1) Assignments must be made considering logical routings,
available roadway capacities, left turns at critical
intersections, and projected (and perceived) minimum travel
times. In addition, multiple paths should often be assigned
between origins and destinations to achieve realistic estimates
rather than assigning all of the trips to the route with the
shortest travel time. The assignments must be carried through
the external site access points and in large projects (those
producing 500 or more additional peak direction trips to or
from the site during the development's peak hour) through the
internal roadways. When the site has more than one access
driveway, logical routing and possibly multiple paths should be
used to obtain realistic driveway volumes. The assignment
should reflect conditions at the time of the analysis.
Assignments can be accomplished either manually or with
applicable computer models.
(2) If a thorough analysis is required to account for pass-by trips,
the following procedure should be used:
(a) Determine the percentage of pass-by trips in the total trips
generated.
(b) Estimate a trip distribution for the pass-by trips.
(c) Perform two separate trip assignments, based on the new
and pass-by trip distributions.
(d) Combine the pass-by and new trip assignment.
(3) Upon completion of the initial site traffic assignment, the
results should be reviewed to see if the volumes appear logical
given characteristics of the road system and trip distribution.
Adjustments should be made if the initial results do not appear
to be logical or reasonable.
L. Total traffic impacts. Traffic estimates for any site with current
traffic activity must reflect not only new traffic associated with the
site's redevelopment but also the trips subtracted from the traffic
stream because of the removal of a land use. The traffic impact
report should clearly depict the traffic estimate and its
components.
§ 320 SAINT MARYS CODE § 320
FWD:786
M. Capacity analysis.
(1) Capacity analysis must be performed at each of the major
street and project site access intersection locations (signalized
and unsignalized) within the study area. In addition, analyses
must be completed for roadway segments deemed sensitive to
site traffic within the study area. These may include such
segments as weaving sections, ramps, internal site roadways,
parking facility access points, and reservoirs for vehicles
queuing off site and on site. Other locations may be deemed
appropriate depending on the situation.
(2) The recommended level-of-service analysis procedures
detailed in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity
Manual must be followed. The City of Saint Marys considers
the overall level-of-service ratings A, B, C, and D to be
acceptable for signalized intersections (level C or better is
considered desirable); level-of-service E or F is considered to
be unacceptable.
(3) The operational analyses in the Highway Capacity Manual
should be used for analyzing existing conditions, traffic
impacts, access requirements, or other future conditions for
which traffic, geometric, and control parameters can be
established.
N. Required levels of service. The recommendations of the traffic
impact study shall provide safe and efficient movement of traffic to
and from, and within and past, the proposed development, while
minimizing the impact to non-site trips. The current levels of
service must be maintained if they are C or D, not allowed to
deteriorate to worse than C if they are currently A or B, and
improved to D if they are E or F.
O. Documentation required. A traffic impact study report shall be
prepared to document the purpose, procedures, findings,
conclusions, and recommendations of the study.
(1) The documentation for a traffic impact study shall include, at a
minimum:
(a) Study purpose and objectives.
(b) Description of the site and study area.
(c) Existing conditions in the area of the development.
(d) Recorded or approved nearby development.
(e) Trip generation, trip distribution, and modal split.
(f) Projected future traffic volumes.

NOTES:
1. Within the cluster development, single-family dwellings may employ a zero-lot-line design
when the following conditions have been met:
a. One side wall of the structure may be located no less than one inch from one of the side
lot lines when adjoining another zero-lot-line dwelling lot. The opposite side yard shall
be least 10 feet wide.
b. A perpetual five-foot wall-maintenance easement shall be provided on the lot adjacent
to the zero-lot-line, which, with the exception of freestanding walls, landscaping and/
or fences, shall be kept clear of all structures. This easement shall be shown on the
plan and incorporated into each deed transferring title to the property. The wall shall be
maintained in its original color and treatment, unless otherwise agreed to, in writing, by
the two affected lot owners.
c. Roof overhangs may penetrate the easement on the adjacent lot a maximum of 24 inches,
but the roof shall be so designed that water runoff from the dwelling's place on the lot
line is limited to the easement area.
d. The wall of a dwelling located along a zero-lot-line shall have no openings (e.g., windows,
doors, air-conditioning units, vents, etc.) unless such openings are located at least eight
feet above grade and have translucent panels.
2. No townhouse building shall contain more than eight units. For each townhouse building
containing more than four units, no more than 60% of such units shall have the same front
yard setback; the minimum variation of setback shall be two feet. In addition, no more than
two contiguous units shall have identical rooflines that generally parallel the ground along
the same horizontal plane. All townhouse buildings shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet
from any interior access drive or parking facilities contained on commonly held lands. All
townhouse buildings shall be set back at least 30 feet from any perimeter boundary of the
development site. In those instances where several townhouse buildings are located on the
same lot, the following footnote 3 shall apply.
3. In those instances where several multiple-family dwelling buildings and/or townhouse
buildings are located on the same lot, the following separation distances will be provided
between each building:
§ 416 FOREWORD § 416
FWD:815
NOTES:
a. Front-to-front, rear-to-rear, or front-to-rear, parallel buildings shall have at least 50 feet
between faces of the building. If the front or rear faces are obliquely aligned, the above
distances may be decreased by as much as 10 feet at one end if increased by a similar
or greater distance at the other end.
b. A minimum yard space of 30 feet is required between end walls of buildings where both
end walls contain windows and 20 feet otherwise. If the buildings are at right angles to
each other, the distance between the corners of the end walls of the building may be
reduced to a minimum of 20 feet.
c. A minimum yard space of 30 feet is required between end walls and front or rear faces
of buildings.
d. All multiple-family dwelling buildings shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from any
interior access drives or parking facilities contained on commonly held lands.

the right-of-way line. Except for multiple-family dwellings, the minimum front yard setback
for accessory residential garages shall be 20 feet.
5. Where dwellings abut the common open space to the rear, the minimum required rear yard
setback shall be reduced to 20 feet.
8. Open space design requirements. As specified in § 416, Subsection 6,
no less than 30% of the total development site's net acreage shall be
devoted to public and open space uses. The following standards shall
also be applied to these areas:
A. Of the minimum amount of open space required within a cluster
development, no less than one-third shall be used for public open
spaces, including centralized common greens, such as
neighborhood parks, commons, buffers, greenways, and golf
courses. The remaining open space may be used for perimeter
buffers and conservation areas.
B. The location and design of required public open spaces shall be
largely determined by a proper site planning process. As part of
this process, applicants shall be required to prepare a natural and
cultural features inventory of the site.
(1) Qualified experts must identify and plot each of the following
found on the proposed site:
(a) One-hundred-year floodplains.
(b) Steep slopes (greater than 15%).
(c) Wetlands, streams, ponds, or other water bodies.
(d) Sinkholes, caves, vistas, or other significant geologic
features.
(e) Threatened or endangered species' habitats.
§ 416 SAINT MARYS CODE § 416
FWD:816
(f) Archaeological resources.
(g) Historic resources.
(h) Significant individual or groups of mature trees.
(2) From this inventory and plot, it shall be incumbent upon the
applicant to demonstrate that the proposed schematic design
of the cluster development minimizes disturbance of but
integrates these features to provide a safe and attractive
network of common pedestrian paths that link areas within the
proposed development. All common pedestrian paths shall
consist of an all-weather, durable surface that is at least four
feet wide.
C. The ownership and maintenance of common open space shall be
governed by § 319 of this chapter.
D. Areas proposed to be dedicated to the City as public parklands may
be located within the common open space, provided that such
parkland complies with the following:
(1) The site shall be located and designed so that safe and
convenient access shall be provided to all existing and
proposed inhabitants. Additionally, each shall have at least one
area available for vehicular access that is no less than 24 feet
in width.
(2) The site shall be sized and configured so as to accommodate its
intended uses. Sufficient lot width/depth dimension shall be
provided so as to accommodate, where practicable, ballfields,
courts, and other open play areas. Furthermore, should a
development be proposed at a location contiguous to an
existing park, parklands shall be provided, where practicable,
as an expansion of an existing facility.
(3) The site shall have suitable topography and soil conditions for
use and development as active play areas. No more than 25%
of the regular open space shall be comprised of floodplains,
stormwater management facilities, and/or slopes exceeding
3%. Any unimproved site shall be provided with a healthy and
vibrant ground cover.
(4) The site shall be located and designed to conveniently access
proximate public utilities (e.g., sewer, water, power, etc.).
However, no part of any overhead utility easement or any
aboveground protrusion of an underground utility should be
permitted in active play areas of the site.
(5) No part of the site shall be calculated as part of any required
setback, yard and/or open space for adjoining lots or uses as
regulated in this chapter.

§ 500. Continuation. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
Except as otherwise provided in this Part, any use, building or structure
lawfully existing at the time of enactment of this chapter may be continued,
although it is not in conformity with the regulations specified by this
chapter.
§ 501. Abandonment. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
If a nonconforming use of land or building or structure ceases or is
discontinued for a period of two years or more, presumption of
abandonment shall arise, and, unless the presumption is rebutted,
resumption of the use of such building, structure or land shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 502. Extension of a Nonconforming Use of Land. [Ord. 227, 12/18/
2006]
Any lawful, nonconforming use of land, exclusive of buildings and
structures, and the use contained therein, may be extended upon the lot on
which it exists, provided that such extension shall be limited to a distance
of a total of 100 feet in any one or a combination of directions from the
existing nonconforming use or to an area equal to 50% of the existing
nonconforming use, whichever is the lesser. The extension of a
nonconforming use on a lot shall be limited to the lot which was in existence
at the time the use became nonconforming. Such extension shall also
conform to area and lot regulations and to the design standards of this
chapter.
§ 503. Expansion or Alteration. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
1. Any nonconforming use may be expanded or altered and, any
nonconforming setback may be laterally extended, by special exception,
and subject to the following criteria, and those contained in § 604,
Subsection 3: [Amended by Ord. 279, 1/21/2013]
A. Expansion of the nonconformity shall be confined to the lot on
which it was located at the time the use became nonconforming.
B. The total of all such expansions or alterations of use shall not
exceed an additional 50% of the actual area of those buildings,
structures or land devoted to the nonconforming use, as they
existed on the date on which such buildings, structures or land first
became nonconformities. The applicant shall furnish conclusive
evidence as to the extent of the nonconformity when it was created.
The above maximum increase shall be measured in aggregate over
the entire life of the nonconformity. All expansions of the
nonconforming use and/or building(s) that occurred since the use
§ 500 FOREWORD § 503
FWD:869
originally became nonconforming shall count toward the above
maximum increase.
C. Provision for vehicular access, off-street parking and off-street
loading shall be consistent with standards required by this chapter.
D. Provision for yards, building height and building area shall be
consistent with the standards required for permitted uses in the
zone in which the nonconformity in question is located.
E. Appearance should be harmonious with surrounding properties;
this feature includes but is not limited to landscaping, enclosure of
principal and accessory uses, height control, sign control,
architectural control, and maintenance of all improvements and
open spaces.
F. Buffers and screens shall be provided as necessary to adequately
protect neighboring properties. This includes but is not limited to
fences, walls, plantings, and open spaces.
G. The expansion shall not create new dimensional nonconformities or
further increase existing dimensional nonconformities.
H. No expansion of a nonconforming structure or a nonconforming use
located outside of a structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter shall be permitted in any floodplain.
I. Excluding expansion, any modification, alteration, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a nonconforming use
or structure located in a floodplain shall be permitted when either
elevated above the base flood elevation or floodproofed. In no case
shall any modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or
improvement cause unacceptable increases in flood height,
velocities or frequencies.
2. Any dimensional nonconformity may be reduced as a permitted use,
even if the reduction does not entirely eliminate the dimensional
nonconformity. Furthermore, any structure that has one or more
nonconforming setbacks may be extended along the same
nonconforming setback(s) line up to a maximum of 50% or 100 feet,
whichever is less, of the area of the building that follows the setback
when it was originally made nonconforming. The diagram below
illustrates this regulation. Nothing within this section shall be
interpreted to allow an increase in any dimensional nonconformity.

FWD:870
§ 504. Substitution or Replacement. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
Any nonconforming use may be replaced or substituted by another
nonconforming use by special exception if the Zoning Hearing Board
determines that the proposed use is at least as equally compatible with,
and not detrimental to, the surrounding area as the original nonconforming
use. In addition, the proposed nonconforming use shall not increase any
dimensional nonconformities. The Zoning Hearing Board may attach
reasonable conditions to the special exception to keep the use compatible
within its surroundings.
§ 505. Restoration. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
Any lawful, nonconforming building or other structure which has been
damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, windstorm, or other cause may be
reconstructed in the same location, provided that:
A. The reconstructed building or structure shall not exceed the height,
area or volume of the damaged or destroyed building or structure, and
such reconstructed building or structure shall not increase any
dimensional nonconformities.
B. Reconstruction shall begin within one year from the date of damage or
destruction and shall be carried on without interruption.

§ 506. Previously Expanded Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
[Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
It is the express intent and purpose of this chapter that, if a building,
structure, sign, or use of land was expanded or extended to the limits of
expansion for a nonconforming building, structure, sign, or use of land as
authorized by a prior zoning regulation or ordinance, no further expansion
of said building, structure, sign, or land shall be authorized. In the event
that a nonconforming building, structure, sign, or use of land was expanded
to a portion of the limits of expansion authorized by a prior zoning
regulation or ordinance, additional expansion, if permitted by this chapter,
shall only be authorized to the amount of expansion not previously utilized
pursuant to said prior zoning regulation or ordinance.
§ 507. Nonconforming Lots of Record. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
In any zone in which single-family detached dwellings are permitted, a
single-family detached dwelling and accessory uses may be erected on any
lot of record held in single and separate ownership on the effective date
of this chapter, or amendment which rendered such lot nonconforming,
and which has continued to be held in single and separate ownership. An
undeveloped remainder of an agriculturally zoned parent tract from which
all legally permitted lots have been subdivided shall not be considered
a lot of record qualifying for an additional dwelling. Development on
nonconforming lots of record shall comply with all yard, height and building
area requirements, unless a variance is granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board.

terms of office shall be five years and shall be so fixed that the term of
office of one member shall expire each year. The Board shall promptly
notify the City Council of any vacancies which occur. Appointments to
fill vacancies shall be only for the unexpired portion of the term.
Members of the Board shall hold no other office in the City.
B. Any member of the Board may be removed for malfeasance,
misfeasance or nonfeasance in office, or for other just cause, by a
majority vote of the City Council taken after the member has received
15 days' advance notice of the intent to take such a vote. A hearing shall
be held in connection with the vote if the member shall request it in
writing.
C. The City Council may appoint, by resolution, at least one, but no more
than three, residents of the City to serve as alternate members of the
Board. The term of office of an alternate member shall be three years.

entitled to participate in all proceedings and discussions of the Board to
the same and full extent as provided by law for Board members,
including specifically the right to cast a vote as a voting member during
the proceedings, and shall have all the powers and duties set forth in
this chapter and as otherwise provided by law. Alternates shall hold no
other office in the City, including Zoning Officer and membership on the
Planning Commission. Any alternate may participate in any proceeding
or discussion of the Board but shall not be entitled to vote as a member
of the Board nor be compensated pursuant to § 602 unless designated
as a voting alternate member pursuant to § 601 of this chapter.

quorum. Any alternate member of the Board shall continue to serve on the
Board in all proceedings involving the matter or case for which the alternate
was initially appointed until the Board has made a final determination of the
matter or case. Designation of an alternate pursuant to this section shall be
made on a case-by-case basis in rotation, according to declining seniority
among all alternates. The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and
forms for its procedure, consistent with ordinances of the City and laws of
the Commonwealth. The Board shall keep full public records of its business,

employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants, and
other technical and clerical services. Members of the Board may receive
compensation for the performance of their duties, as may be fixed by the
City Council. Alternate members of the Board may receive compensation, as
may be fixed by the City Council, for the performance of their duties when
designated as alternate members pursuant to § 601, but in no case shall
such compensation exceed the rate of compensation authorized to be paid
to the members by the City Council.

agreed, in writing, to an extension of time. Each subsequent
hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board or its hearing officer
shall be held within 45 days of the prior hearing, unless otherwise

shall complete the presentation of his case-in-chief within 100 days
of the first hearing. Upon request of the applicant, the Board or
hearing officer shall assure that the applicant receives at least
seven hours of hearings within the 100 days, including the first
hearing. Persons opposed to the application shall complete their
opposition to the application within 100 days of the first hearing
held after the completion of the applicant's case-in-chief. An
applicant may, upon request, be granted additional hearings to
complete his case-in-chief, provided that the persons opposed to
the application are granted an equal number of additional
hearings. Persons opposed to the application may, upon the written
consent or consent on the record by the applicant and municipality,
be granted additional hearings to complete their opposition to the
application, provided that the applicant is granted an equal number
of additional hearings for rebuttal.
2. The hearings shall be conducted by the Board, or the Board may
appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing officer.
The decision or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall be
made by the Board; however, the appellant or the applicant, as the case
may be, in addition to the City, may, prior to the decision of the hearing,
waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the decision or
findings of the hearing officer as final.
3. The parties to the hearing shall be the City, any person affected by the
application who has made timely appearance of record before the

stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for a
stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the Board.
The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board, if the
transcript is ordered by the Board or hearing officer; or shall be paid by
the person appealing the decision of the Board, if such appeal is made,
and in either event the cost of additional copies shall be paid by the
person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases, the party
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
8. The Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party or his representatives in connection with any
issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate; shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff
memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their solicitor,
unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the material so
noticed; and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the
commencement of hearings with any party or his representative unless
all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
9. The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing before
the Board or hearing officer. Where the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon, together with the reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of the Act or of this chapter, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and the
reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the
facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer and there
has been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board
shall make his report and recommendations available to the parties
within 45 days, and the parties shall be entitled to make written
representations thereon to the Board prior to final decision or entry of
findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered no later than 30 days
after the report of the hearing officer. Except for substantive challenges
to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance filed under Section 916.1 of the
Act where the Board fails to render the decision within the period
required by this subsection or fails to commence, conduct, or complete
the required hearing as provided in § 603, Subsection 1C, of this
chapter, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of
the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed, in writing or on the
record, to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in
favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to meet or

render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board shall give public
notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day it could have
met to render a decision, in the same manner as provided in § 603,
Subsection 1, of this chapter. If the Board shall fail to provide such
notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this subsection shall
prejudice the right of any party opposing the application to appeal the
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
10. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have
filed their name and address with the Board not later than the last day
of the hearing, the Board shall provide, by mail or otherwise, brief
notice of the decision or findings and a statement of the place at which
the full decision or findings may be examined.
A. Substantive challenges to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance, except
those brought before the City Council pursuant to § 703, Subsection 5,
of this chapter.
(1) If a challenge heard by the Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include
recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance which will
cure the defects found. In reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools, and other public service facilities.
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or Official Zoning Map.
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed,
considering the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands,
floodplains, aquifers, natural resources, and other natural
features.
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources, and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts.
§ 603 FOREWORD § 604
FWD:877
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(2) Public notice of the hearing shall be provided as specified in § 703,
Subsection 2A, of this chapter.
(3) The Zoning Hearing Board shall commence its hearings within 60
days after the request is filed, unless the landowner requests or
consents to an extension of time.
(4) The Zoning Hearing Board shall render its decision within 45 days
after the conclusion of the last hearing. If the Board fails to act on
the landowner's request within this time limit, a denial of the
request is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close
of the last hearing.
B. Challenges to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance, raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption,
which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after
the effective date of the ordinance.
C. Special exceptions, as provided for in this chapter and subject to all
applicable requirements, including but not limited to:
(1) Filing requirements. In addition to the required building permit
information (see § 701), each special exception application shall
include the following:
(a) Ground-floor plans and elevations of proposed structures.
(b) Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including
properties directly across a public right-of-way.
(c) A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail
and accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable
provisions of this chapter.
(d) A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
(2) General criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate, by credible
evidence, compliance with the following:
(a) The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and
intent of this chapter.
(b) The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment
of adjoining or nearby properties.
(c) The proposed use will not substantially change the character of
the subject property's neighborhood.
§ 604 SAINT MARYS CODE § 604
FWD:878
(d) Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed
use (e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer,
water and other utilities, parks, solid waste disposal, vehicular
access, etc.).
(e) The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically
attached to it. In addition, the proposed use must comply with
all other applicable regulations contained in this chapter.
(f) The traffic generated by the proposed use shall be safely and
adequately accommodated during peak and non-peak periods,
or improvements made by the applicant shall be made in order
to effect the same.
(g) The proposed use shall be in and of itself properly designed
with regard to internal circulation, parking, buffering,
screening, and all other elements of proper design, as required
by this chapter and any other federal, state or local ordinance,
law or regulation.
(h) The proposed use will not have a deleterious impact on
adjoining properties or the neighborhood due to impacts and/
or by-products of the proposed use, such as noise, dust, odor,
smoke, litter, glare, heat, radiation, electromagnetic
interference, etc.
(i) The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of
the Comprehensive Plan.
(j) For development within the Floodplain Zone, the application
shall comply with those requirements listed in § 230 of this
chapter. [Amended by Ord. 279, 1/21/2013]
(3) Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board, in approving special
exception applications, may attach conditions considered
necessary to protect the public welfare and the purposes listed
above, including conditions which are more restrictive than those
established for other uses in the same zone. These conditions shall
be enforceable by the Zoning Officer, and failure to comply with
such conditions shall constitute a violation of this chapter and be
subject to the penalties described in Part 7.
(4) Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the special
exception pursuant to § 604C(1) shall become an official part of the
record for said special exception. Approval of any special exception
will also bind the use in accordance with the submitted site plan;
therefore, should a change in the site plan be required as part of
the approval of the use, the applicant shall revise the site plan prior
to the issuance of a building permit. Any subsequent change made,
after the issuance of a building permit, to the proposed use of the
subject property which is not reflected on the approved site plan
§ 604 FOREWORD § 604
FWD:879
may, at the discretion of the Zoning Officer, require the obtainment
of another special exception approval.
D. Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of
application to the Zoning Officer, which shall at least include the
following:
(1) Filing requirements. In addition to the required building permit
information (see § 701), each variance shall include the following:
(a) The names and addresses of adjoining property owners,
including properties directly across a public right-of-way.
(b) A scaled drawing (site plan) with sufficient detail and accuracy
so as to present the nature of the request and the unique site
conditions that create hardship to strict compliance with this
chapter.
(c) A written description of the requested variance, along with a
description of the hardship that is being alleged, and all
reasons why the variance should be granted.
(2) General criteria. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all
of the following findings are made, where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or zone in which
the property is located.
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the zone or neighborhood in which the property is
located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.

§ 605. Parties Appellant Before the Board. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
Appeals under §§ 604E, F, G, and H and proceedings to challenge this
chapter under §§ 604A and B may be filed with the Board, in writing, by

aggrieved. Requests for a variance under § 604D and for special exception
under § 604C may be filed with the Board by any landowner or any tenant
with the permission of such landowner. Any appeal shall state:
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulations in issue.
(f) That variances within the Floodplain Zone shall comply with
§ 230, Subsection 11, of this chapter.
(g) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. These
conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer, and
failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a
violation of this chapter and be subject to the penalties
described in Part 7.
E. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but not
limited to the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act on the
application therefor, the issuance of any cease-and-desist order, or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or
lot.
F. Appeals from a determination by the City Engineer or the Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any provisions contained
within the Floodplain Zone.
G. Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under § 916.2 (and any
subsequent amendments) of the Act.
H. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or City Engineer
in the administration of any land use ordinance with reference to
sedimentation and erosion control and/or stormwater management for
applications not involving a subdivision/land development nor a
planned residential development, as regulated in Parts V and VII of the
Act, respectively.
A. The name and address of the appellant and applicant.
B. The name and address of the landowner of the real estate to be

§ 606. Time Limitations. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
C. A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by such
proposed change, together with a plot plan, drawn to scale, with
sufficient clarity to show the nature and character of the request.
D. A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question, the improvements thereon, and the present use thereof.
E. A statement of the section of this chapter under which the request may
be allowed and reasons why it should or should not be granted.
1. If a variance or special exception is granted, or the issuance of a permit
is approved, or other action authorized, the necessary permit shall be
secured and the authorized action begun within two years after the
date when the variance or special exception is finally granted, or the
issuance of a permit is finally approved, or the other action authorized,
and the building or alteration, as the case may be, shall be completed
within four years of said date. For good cause, the Board may, upon
application, in writing, stating the reasons therefor, extend either the
two-year or four-year period.
2. Should the applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits within said
two-year period or, having obtained the permit, should he fail to
commence work thereunder within such two-year period, it shall be
conclusively presumed that the applicant has waived, withdrawn, or
abandoned his appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances
and permits granted to him shall be deemed automatically rescinded by
the Board.
3. Should the applicant commence construction or alteration within said
two-year period but should he fail to complete such construction or
alteration within said three-year period, the Board may, upon 10 days'
notice, in writing, rescind or revoke the granted variance or special
exception, or the issuance of the permit or permits, or the other action
authorized.
4. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later
than 30 days after an application for development, preliminary or final,
has been approved by the Zoning Officer or the agency responsible for
granting such approval if such proceeding is designed to secure
reversal or to limit the approval in any manner, unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice or knowledge or reason to
believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
5. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of
this chapter or the Official Zoning Map pursuant to Section 916.2 of the
Act, as amended, shall preclude an appeal from a final approval, except

§ 607. Stay of Proceedings. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
§ 608. Appeals. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
Any person, taxpayer or the City aggrieved by any decision of the Board
may, within 30 days after such decision of the Board, seek review by the
Court of Common Pleas of such decision in the manner provided by the
in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative preliminary approval.
1. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in § 605, and during its
pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer, or of any
agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed, unless
the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to
life or property, in which case the development or official action shall
not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed
to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
2. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court. The question whether or not
such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be
within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for
bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding party to

(12) To issue stop-work orders when the Zoning Officer determines
that a violation of this chapter exists or that construction is
being commenced in a manner not authorized by a permit or in
a manner violating any approvals issued under this chapter.
This Zoning Officer may issue stop-work orders orally or in
writing. If the Zoning Officer issues an oral stop-work order,
the Zoning Officer shall subsequently confirm such oral stopwork

when acting within his/her scope of employment.
3. Violations.
A. Failure to secure a building permit prior to a change in use of land
or structure or the erection, construction or alteration of any
structure or portion thereof shall be a violation of this chapter. It
shall also be a violation of this chapter to undertake other
deliberate actions which are contrary to the terms of this chapter
and any conditions placed upon the approval of special exceptions,
variances, and conditional uses. Each day that a violation is
continued shall constitute a separate offense.
B. If it appears to the Zoning Officer that a violation of this chapter
enacted under the Act or prior enabling laws has occurred, he/she
shall initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an enforcement
notice, as provided in the following:
(1) The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of
the parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person
who has filed a written request to receive enforcement notices
regarding that parcel, and to any other person requested in
writing by the owner of record.
(2) An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
(a) The name of the owner of record and any other person
against whom the City intends to take action.
(b) The location of the property in violation.
(c) The specific violation, with a description of the
requirements which have not been met, citing, in each
instance, the applicable provisions of the chapter.

commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.

sanctions clearly described.
4. Enforcement remedies. Any person, partnership or corporation who or
which has violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this
chapter enacted under the Act or prior enabling laws shall, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by

the City, pay a judgment of not more than $500, plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the City as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the City may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of
civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the District Justice, determining that there
has been a violation, further determines that there was a good-faith
basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the chapter
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event,
there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the
fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
District Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney's fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid
over to the City.
5. Causes of action. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is
or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
repaired, converted, maintained, or used in violation of this chapter
enacted under the Act or prior enabling laws, the governing body or,
with the approval of the governing body, an officer of the municipality,
or any aggrieved owner or tenant of real property who shows that his
property or person will be substantially affected by the alleged
violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate
action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate such
building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent, in or about such
premises, any act, conduct, business, or use constituting a violation.
When any such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of
that action shall be served upon the municipality at least 30 days prior
to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint on the
governing body of the municipality. No such action may be maintained

place where and the times when a copy of the request,
including any plans, explanatory material or proposed
amendments, may be examined by the public.
(2) For Zoning Map amendments, public notice shall also include

the municipality not more than 60 days nor less than seven days
prior to passage. The published content of the enactment notice

F. The hearings shall be conducted by the Council, or the Council may
appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing

prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or findings by
the Council and accept the decision or findings of the hearing
officer as final.

the application who has made timely appearance of record before
the City Council, and any other person, including civic or

days from the date of said referral. The recommendation of the City
Planning Commission may include a specific statement as to
whether or not the proposed amendment is in accordance with the
intent of this chapter and any officially adopted Comprehensive
Plan of the City. The City Council cannot act upon the amendment
until it has received a recommendation from the City Planning

submit its recommendation within 45 days, the City Council may
proceed without its recommendation.
N. Elk County Planning Commission referrals. All proposed
amendments shall be submitted to the Elk County Planning
Commission at least 30 days prior to public hearing on such
amendments. The Elk County Planning Commission may submit
recommendations to the City Council within 45 days of such
referral. The City Council cannot act upon the amendment until it
has received a recommendation from the Elk County Planning
§ 703 FOREWORD § 703
FWD:901
Commission; however, should the Elk County Planning Commission
fail to submit its recommendation within 45 days, the City Council
may proceed without its recommendation.
O. The Municipal Solicitor shall represent and advise the City Council
during the hearings. Additionally, the City Council may retain an
independent attorney to defend the challenged ordinance or map
and present suitable witnesses for that purpose.
P. In reviewing the curative amendment, the City Council may deny
the request, accept the request as submitted, or may adopt an
alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects. The
City Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts.
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
Q. The City Council shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing.
R. If the City Council fails to act on the landowner's request within the
time limits referred to in the above Subsection 6P, a denial of the
request is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close
of the last hearing.
S. The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
(1) The City Council fails to commence the hearing within 60 days;
§ 703 SAINT MARYS CODE § 703
FWD:902
(2) The City Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment;
(3) The City Council adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner; or
(4) The City Council fails to act on the request 45 days after the
close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is
extended by mutual consent by the landowner and the
Municipality.
T. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to
him not later than the day following its date. To all other persons
who have filed their name and address with the City Council not
later than the last day of the hearing, the City Council shall provide,
by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a
statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may be
examined.
U. Adjournment of public hearing. If, during the public hearing
process, the City Council needs additional time to understand the
proposal, inform the public, receive public comment, and/or render
a decision, it may adjourn the public hearing to a time and place
certain.
V. Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to the
Zoning Ordinance shall be forwarded to the Elk County Planning
Commission.
W. Where, after the effective date of the Act, a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment
application by the City Council pursuant to this section or a validity
challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to
§ 604, Subsection 1, or the court acts finally on appeal from denial
of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge, and the
proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application
for subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two
years from the date of such approval to file an application for
preliminary or tentative approval for a subdivision, land
development or planned residential development. Within the twoyear
period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning,
subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in
any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as
granted in the curative amendment or the sustained validity
challenge. Upon the filing of the preliminary or tentative plan, the
provisions of Section 508 (4) of the Act shall apply.
X. Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment
application or the validity challenge is approved but does not
require further application under any Subdivision or Land
Development Ordinance,100 the developer shall have one year
§ 703 FOREWORD § 703
FWD:903
within which to file for a zoning permit. Within the one-year period,
no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in
the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During
these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume
jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such supplemental relief
as may be necessary.
Y. At such time as the City officially adopts a Multi-Municipal
Comprehensive Plan but has not adopted a joint municipal
ordinance, and all municipalities participating in the Multi-
Municipal Comprehensive Plan have adopted and are
administering zoning ordinances generally consistent with the
provisions of the Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan, and a
challenge is brought to the validity of this chapter involving a
proposed use, then the City Council shall consider the availability
of uses under zoning ordinances within the municipalities
participating in the Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan within a
reasonable geographic area and shall not limit its consideration to
the challenge of this chapter.
7. Curative amendment by the City Council.
A. The City Council, by formal action, may declare this chapter or
portions thereof substantively invalid and propose to prepare a
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days
following such declaration and proposal, the City Council shall:
(1) By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of the ordinance or portions thereof, which may
include:
(a) References to specific uses which are either not permitted
or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
(b) References to a class of use or uses which require revision;
or
(c) References to the entire ordinance which requires
revisions.
(2) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to the
ordinance to correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
City Council shall enact a curative amendment to validate or
reaffirm the validity of this chapter, pursuant to the provisions
required by Section 609 of the Act, in order to cure the declared
invalidity of the ordinance.
100. Editor's Note: See Ch. 22, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 703 SAINT MARYS CODE § 703
FWD:904
§ 704. Conditional Uses. [Ord. 227, 12/18/2006]
C. Upon the date of the declaration and proposal, the City Council
shall not be required to entertain or consider any curative
amendment filed by a landowner; nor shall the Zoning Hearing
Board be required to give a report, upon request, for a challenge to
the validity of the ordinance under § 604, Subsection 1, subsequent
to the declaration and proposal, based upon the grounds identical
to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution
required by this section. Upon the enactment of a curative
amendment to, or the reaffirmation of the validity of, this chapter,
no rights to a cure by amendment or challenge shall, from the date
of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the
basis of the substantive invalidity of the unamended Zoning
Ordinance for which the City Council proposes to prepare a
curative amendment.
D. The City Council, having utilized the procedures as set forth in this
section, may not again utilize said procedures for a thirty-six-month
period following the date of the enactment of a curative
amendment or reaffirmation of the validity of the ordinance;
provided, however, that if, after the date of declaration and
proposal, there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed
upon the City by virtue of a decision by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the City Council may utilize the provisions of this
section to prepare a curative amendment to the ordinance to fulfill
this duty or obligation.
8. Authentication of Official Zoning Map. Whenever there has been a
change in the boundary of a zone or a reclassification of the zone
adopted in accordance with the above, the change on the Official
Zoning Map shall be made and shall be duly certified by the City
Secretary and shall thereafter be refiled as part of the permanent
records of the City.
9. Any applicant requesting an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/
or Map shall submit information about such request that complies with
this chapter and justifies the request. In addition, the applicant must
submit, in a format that can be adopted by the City Council, the
necessary amendments that make the Comprehensive Plan generally
consistent with the requested amendment.
1. Filing of conditional use. For any use permitted by conditional use, a
conditional use must be obtained from the City Council. In addition to
the information required on the building permit application, the
conditional use application must show:
A. Ground-floor plans and elevations of proposed structures.
B. Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including
properties directly across a public right-of-way.
§ 703 FOREWORD § 704
FWD:905
C. A clear and legible site plan, drawn at a scale of 10 feet, 20 feet, 30
feet, 40 feet, or 50 feet to the inch.
D. A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
2. General criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
following:
A. The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of
this chapter.
B. The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or nearby properties.
C. The proposed use will not effect a change in the character of the
subject property's neighborhood.
D. Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use
(e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water,
and other utilities, vehicular access, etc.).
E. For development within the Floodplain Zone, that the application
complies with those requirements listed in City of Saint Marys
Floodplain Overlay Zone, as regulated by § 230 of this chapter.
F. The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically listed
in Part 4 of this chapter. In addition, the proposed use must comply
with all other applicable regulations of this chapter.
G. The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of the
Comprehensive Plan.
3. Conditions. The City Council, in approving conditional use applications,
may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public
welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are
more restrictive than those established for other uses in the same zone.
These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer, and failure
to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this
chapter and be subject to the penalties described in this Part.
4. Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the conditional
use pursuant to § 704, Subsection 1, shall become an official part of the
record for said conditional use. Approval of any conditional use will also
bind the use in accordance with the submitted site plan; therefore,
should a change in the site plan be required as part of the approval of
the use, the applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of a
building permit. Any subsequent change made after the issuance of a
building permit to the proposed use on the subject property, which is
not reflected on the approved site plan, may require the obtainment of
another conditional use approval.
§ 704 SAINT MARYS CODE § 704
FWD:906
5. Hearing procedures.
A. Before voting on the approval of a conditional use, the City Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. As an
alternative, the City Council may appoint any one of its members or
an independent attorney to act as a hearing officer. The City
Council shall submit each such application to the City Planning
Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such
application, to provide the City Planning Commission an

the original transcript shall be paid by the City Council if the

be paid by the person appealing the decision of the City Council or
hearing officer if such appeal is made; and, in either event, the cost
of additional copies shall be paid by the person requesting such
copy or copies. In other cases, the party requesting the original
transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
I. The City Council or hearing officer shall not communicate, directly
or indirectly, with any party or his representative in connection
with any issue involved, except upon notice and opportunity for all
parties to participate, shall not take notice of any communication,
reports, staff memoranda, or other materials, except advice from
their solicitor, unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to
contest the material so noticed, and shall not inspect the site or its
surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party
or his representative unless all parties are given an opportunity to
be present.
J. The City Council shall render a written decision or, when no
decision is called for, make written findings on the conditional use
application within 45 days after the last hearing before the City
Council. However, the applicant and the Municipality may, prior to
the decision of the hearing, waive the decision or findings by the
City Council and accept the decision or findings of the hearing
officer as final. Where the application is contested or denied, each
decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact or conclusions
based thereon, together with any reasons therefor. Conclusions
based on any provisions of this chapter or of any ordinance, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and
the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light
of the facts found.
K. The first hearing before the City Council or its hearing officer shall
be commenced within 60 days from the date of the receipt of the
applicant's application, unless the applicant has agreed, in writing,

Council or its hearing officer shall be held within 45 days of the
prior hearing, unless otherwise agreed to be the applicant in
writing or on the record. An applicant shall complete the
presentation of his case-in-chief within 100 days of the first
hearing. Upon request of the applicant, the City Council or hearing
§ 704 SAINT MARYS CODE § 704
FWD:908
officer shall assure that the applicant receives at least seven hours
of hearings within the 100 days, including the first hearing. Persons
opposed to the application shall complete their opposition to the
application within 100 days of the first hearing held after the
completion of the applicant's case-in-chief. An applicant may, upon
request, be granted additional hearings to complete his case-inchief,
provided that the persons opposed to the application are
granted an equal number of additional hearings. Persons opposed
to the application may, upon the written consent or consent on
the record by the applicant and Municipality, be granted additional
hearings to complete their opposition to the application, provided
that the applicant is granted an equal number of additional
hearings for rebuttal.
L. Where the City Council or hearing officer fails to render the
decision within the period required by this subsection or fails to
commence, conduct or complete the required hearing as required
by this subsection, the decision shall be deemed to have been
rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed,
in writing or on the record, to an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of
the City Council or hearing officer to meet or render a decision as
hereinabove provided, the City Council or hearing officer shall give
public notice of the decision within 10 days from the last day it
could have met to render a decision in the same manner as
required by the public notice requirements of this chapter. If the
City Council or hearing officer shall fail to provide such notice, the
applicant may do so.
M. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction. A copy of the final decision or, where no
decision is called for, of the findings shall be delivered to the
applicant personally or mailed to him no later than the day
following its date.

application within 120 days of the date of filing of a complete
application. [Added by Ord. 275, 7/2/2012]
6. Time limitation.
A. If a conditional use is granted, the necessary permit shall be
secured, and the authorized action begun, within two years after
the date when the conditional use is finally granted, and the
building or alteration, as the case may be, shall be completed
within four years of said date. For good cause, the City Council may,
at any time, upon application, in writing, extend either of these
deadlines.

should he fail to commence work thereunder within such two-year
period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or
applicant has waived, withdrawn or abandoned his application, and
all approvals and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the City Council.
C. Should the appellant commence construction or alteration within
said two-year period but should he fail to complete such
construction or alteration within said four-year period, the City
Council may, upon 10 days' notice, in writing, rescind or revoke the
granted conditional use, if the City Council finds that no good cause
appears for the failure to complete within such four-year period,
and if the City Council further finds that conditions have altered or
changed in the interval since the granting of the conditional use
that revocation or rescission of the action is justified.
D. As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as
part of the original application before the Council, the granting of a
timetable associated with the request which would supersede the
deadlines imposed in §§ 704, Subsection 6A through C. In so doing,
the applicant must demonstrate that the times requested are
logically related to normal and expected progress of the project. In
approving a timetable under this section, the Council must
establish and bind a definite time-frame for issuance of a building
permit and completion of construction of the project.
