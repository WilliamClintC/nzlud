reasonable measures to protect public records from the possibility of theft,
alteration, modification, or damage. The ORO shall be required to be present
when public records are examined and inspected by a requester.
5. The ORO shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for
Borough public records. The Borough is neither required nor expected to
provide extraordinary staff to respond to a public record request, but will
respond in a manner consistent with the Borough’s administrative responsibilities
and consistent with the requirements of the RTKL.
6. The ORO shall note on all written public record requests, the date
of receipt of the request and the date that is five (5) business days
thereafter, and the ORO shall respond to the request within that period. If
the Borough does not respond within five (5) business days of the receipt
thereof, the request automatically shall be deemed denied without further
action to that effect.
7. The ORO shall notify a third party of a request for a record if the
third party provided the record and included a written statement signed by a
representative of the third party that the record contains a trade secret or
confidential proprietary information. Notification to the third party shall
be provided within five (5) business days from the receipt of a public record
request. The third party shall have five (5) business days from the date of
the notice from the ORO to provide input on the release of the record. The
ORO shall either deny the request for the record or release the record to the
requester within ten (10) business days of the date of notice to the third
party and shall notify the third party of the ORO’s decision.
8. The ORO’s response to all public record requests shall consist of
either (A) approval for access to the public record; (B) notice that the
request is being reviewed; or (C) denial of access to the record requested.
9. The ORO shall promulgate (and may amend from time to time as deemed
appropriate by the ORO) and post in the Borough Office a fee schedule for all
fees and charges applicable to fulfilling public record requests, which fees
and charges shall not exceed any limits imposed by the RTKL the PaOOR, and
the Borough Council. Until the ORO establishes such fee schedule, the fees
- 28 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(1, §903(9), cont’d) (1, §903(9), cont’d)
for paper copies shall be twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page per side; for
police reports shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00) per report or twenty-five
cents ($0.25) per page per side, whichever is greater; for certification of
a record shall be one dollar ($1.00) per record; for specialized documents
including, without limitation, blueprints, color copies, and nonstandard
sized documents, shall be the actual charges for the cost of production; and
for mailing (if such is requested by the requester), the actual cost of the
postage and other mailing charges, costs, and expenses. The ORO (if not
otherwise directed by the Borough) or the Borough may waive any such fees.
A. In the event the estimated cost of fulfilling a public record
request submitted under this Policy is expected to exceed one hundred
dollars ($100.00), the ORO shall obtain the expected cost in advance of
fulfilling the public record request to avoid unwarranted expense of
Borough resources, and if the requester fails or refuses to duly pay
such expected costs at the time of the public record request or when
subsequently requested by the ORO, the request may be denied by the ORO.
10. If the public record needs to be reviewed in the opinion of the
ORO, the ORO shall provide the requester with a written notice including,
without limitation, a statement notifying the requester that the public
record request for access is being reviewed, the reason for the review, a
reasonable date that a response is expected to be provided, and an estimate
of the applicable fees owed when the record becomes available. If the date
that a response is expected to be provided is in excess of thirty (30) days
following the five (5) business days normally allowed for a response, the
public record request for access automatically shall be deemed denied without
further action to that effect unless the requester has agreed in writing to
an extension to the date specified in the notice. If, the requester agrees
to the extension, the public record request shall be deemed denied on the day
following the date specified in the notice if the ORO has not provided a
response by that date. Review of the public record request generally is
limited to the following situations:
A. The record public record requested contains information that
is subject to access, as well as information which is not subject to
access, that must be redacted prior to a grant of access. The redacted
information is considered a denial as to the redacted information.
B. The record requires retrieval from a remote location.
C. A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing
limitations.
D. A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record
is subject to access.
E. The requester has failed to comply with the Borough’s policy
and procedure or other applicable requirements.
F. The requester refuses to pay any or all applicable fees.
G. The extent or nature of the public record request precludes
a response within the required time period.
11. If access to a requested public record is denied, the notice
provided by the ORO shall be in writing and shall contain, without limitation,
a notice of denial; the specific reason(s) for denial; any legal
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 28.1 -
(1, §903(11), cont’d) (1, §903(11), cont’d)
authority for the denial; and a notice of the requester’s right to appeal the
denial to the PaOOR within fifteen (15) business days of the mailing date of
the notice or deemed denial.
12. The ORO shall maintain an electronic or paper copy of each written
public record request including, without limitation, all documents submitted
with the request until such request has been fulfilled. If the public record
request is denied, the written public record request shall be maintained for
thirty (30) days or, if an appeal is filed, until a final determination is
issued by the Office of Open Records or the appeal is deemed denied.
13. If a public record request is denied or deemed denied, the
requester may file an appeal of the denial with the PaOOR within fifteen (15)
business days of the mailing date of the ORO’s notice of denial, or fifteen
(15) days of a deemed denial. The appeal shall state the grounds upon which
the requester asserts that the record is a public record and shall address
any grounds stated by the Borough for delaying or denying the public record
request.
14. Within thirty (30) days of the mailing date of the final determination
of the PaOOR appeals officer, the requester or the Borough may file a
petition for review (or other document as required by rule of court) with the
Court of Common Pleas for Lancaster County. The proper filing of such a
petition for review shall stay the release of the requested documents that
are the subject of the appeal until a final decision is issued by the Court.
(Res. 416, 1/6/2009, §1)

Dangerous Structures
5101. Legislative Findings. The Borough Code, Act of February 1,
1966, P.L. (1965) ----, No. 581, §1202(5), 53 P.S. §46202(5), grants a
borough, the power to require the owner or occupier of premises to remove
or repair any dangerous structures, and in default thereof to have such
premises removed or repaired by the Borough. The Borough of New Holland
currently lacks a comprehensive building code, nor does the Council for the
Borough of New Holland deem it appropriate to enact such a comprehensive
building code. However, circumstances may arise regarding structures
within the Borough of New Holland which constitute a public nuisance or a
danger. Council for the Borough of New Holland deems it to be in the best
interest of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Borough
of New Holland to enact an ordinance in furtherance of the powers granted
by the aforesaid Section of the Borough Code so as to enable the Borough of
New Holland to ,require the abatement of any nuisance, or the repair or
removal of any such nuisance or dangerous structure. (Ord. 395, 5/1/1990,
51)
5102. Definitions. The following words and phrases, when used in
this Part, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this Section, except
in those instances where the context indicates otherwise:
BOROUGH - the Borough of New Holland, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
DANGEROUS STRUCTURE - any building or structure which is unsafe for
life, limb and/or health, and/or which is offensive to the public health,
safety, and welfare of the community; and any building or structure which
is structurally unsafe, damaged, decayed, dilapidated, dangerous,
unsanitary, deficient in adequate exitway facility, or vermin infested; any
building or structure which constitutes a fire hazard; or any building or
structure which is otherwise dangerous to human life or the public welfare,

§202. Legislative Intent. The Council of the Borough of New Holland,
recognizing the problem of crimes committed by and committed against
juveniles during the nighttime, and believing that it can be dealt with more
effectively by regulating the hours during which minors less than eighteen

without adult supervision, and by defining more clearly certain duties and
responsibilities upon those who have the custody and responsibility for the
care of such minors, hereby enacts this Part for the purpose of promoting the
general welfare and protecting the general public through reduction of
juvenile violence and crime within the Borough of New Holland, promoting the
safety and welfare of the Borough’s citizens under the age of eighteen (18)
years, whose youth and inexperience renders them particularly vulnerable to
becoming participants in criminal activity and in being victimized by

Borough of New Holland. (Ord. 504, 10/5/2004, §7)
- 54 - Page Revised 7/1/2014

§209. Penalties. Before taking any enforcement action under this
Section. A police officer shall ask the apparent offender’s age and reason
for being in the public place. The officer shall not issue a citation or

an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other circumstances.
No exception set forth in §204 of this Part applies.

or operates any sound source which does not comply with the provisions
or standards of this Part.
B. Application. The application shall state the standard,
provision or section from which the variance is being sought and the
period of time and reasons for which the variance is sought. It shall
contain information which demonstrates that bringing the sources of
sound or activity for which the variance is sought into compliance with
this Part would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant,
and it shall contain any other supporting information which may
reasonably be required.
C. Public Notification. Public notice of an application and the
date, time and place of the public hearing to be held thereon for a
variance shall be given by publishing notice thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation in the city at least once, not less than three (3)
days prior to the scheduled public hearing, and by, if practicable,
conspicuously posting the premises that is the source of the sound for
which the variance is sought.
D. Hearing. The Board shall hold a public hearing to decide
variance applications presented to it. Any person who claims to be
affected by allowance of the variance may become a party to the hearing.
All proceedings shall be conducted under the provisions of the Pennsylvania
Local Agency Act.
E. Review Standards. In determining whether to grant or deny the
application, the Board shall balance the hardship to the applicant
versus the adverse impact to the public health, safety and welfare and
shall consider at a minimum the following conditions:
(1) The physical characteristics of the emitted sound.
(2) The times and duration of the emitted sound.
(3) The geography, zone and population density of the
affected area.
(4) Whether the public health and safety is endangered.
(5) Whether the sound source predates the receivers.
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 56.11 -
(6, §507(1)(E), cont’d) (6, §507(1)(E), cont’d)
(6) Whether compliance with the standards from which the
variance is sought would produce hardship without equal or greater
benefit to the public.
F. Decision. The Board shall render a written decision in
granting or denying the application for variance and, if denied, shall
state the reasons therefor. The Board’s decision shall be made
available to the applicant and any other person who requests it in
writing. In granting a variance the Board may attach reasonable
conditions, including, but not limited to, placing a time limit on the
permitted activity and/or establishing a time schedule within which the
source of sound or activity for which the variance was sought must be
brought into compliance with this Part. Where the grant of a variance
is conditioned, the variance shall not become effective until all
conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any
condition of the variance shall terminate it and subject the person
holding it to those provisions of this Part regulating the source of
sound or activity for which the variance was granted. Variances may be
granted for a period of up to one (1) year. The person obtaining the
variance may reapply for additional variance periods under terms set
forth by the applicant and the Board.
G. Appeals. Appeal from an adverse decision of the Board shall
be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County.

Part 1
Regulating Fires and Burning
§101. Legislative Findings. The Borough of New Holland, and other
rural communities, have traditionally permitted the burning of material as
a means of disposal thereof. Increased development, both commercial and
residential, have caused conflicts with such means of disposal of waste.
Such burning produces smoke and soot, which constitute a nuisance to
adjoining landowners. Such burning also constitutes a fire hazard. The
State and Federal government have become increasingly concerned about air
quality and air pollution in the Southeast Pennsylvania region, as
evidenced by regulations of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency regarding monitoring and testing of auto emissions and legislation
enacted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding the same. The
Borough of New Holland has regulated burning by the issuance of permits.
There are currently fewer than ten (10) such permits issued in the Borough
of New Holland. A ban on burning would therefore impact few citizens or
businesses within the Borough of New Holland. As a result of concern for
increased air pollution problems, public nuisances and fire hazards, and
due to the minimal impact on citizens and businesses of the Borough of New
Holland from a ban on burning, Council for the Borough of New Holland deems
it to be in the best interests of the Borough of New Holland and its
residents to prohibit the burning of any materials except as specifically
set forth in this Part. (Ord. 422, 3/2/1993, §1)
§102. Definitions. As used in this Part, the following terms shall
have the meaning indicated, unless a different meaning clearly appears from
the context:
COOK STOVE or GRILL - any devise designed, constructed and/or
manufactured for the exclusive purpose of cooking food, where the fuel for
a fire contained therein is wood, charcoal, coal, liquid propane gas or
natural gas.
FURNACE - any enclosed device specifically designed and used
exclusively for burning of any material for the production of heat.
INCINERATOR - any device specifically designed and constructed for the
burning of waste. Such definition shall not include any furnace, any
indoor decorative fireplace, or any indoor wood or coal heating stove or
cook stove. An enclosed barrel or drum shall not constitute
an incinerator, whether or not the same includes a flue. Any device lacking a
flue shall not constitute an incinerator, regardless of the purpose for
which such device is designed or constructed.
OPEN FIRE - an unenclosed fire in which any material is burned and
where air contaminates, including smoke and/or odor are emitted to the open
air other than through a flue, with the exception of a cook stove or grill.
WASTE - all putrescible animal and vegetable matter resulting from the
handling, preparation, cooking and consumption of food; any combustible
solid material including, but not limited to, old clothes, leather, wood,
paper, cardboard, furniture, packing materials and other similar materials;
trees, shrubs, branches, leaves and other vegetation; and any other
flammable material, regardless of the source thereof, including, but

containing asbestos, paint, paint thinners, turpentine, tar or petroleum
products, any other flammable liquids, plaster, drywall or gypsum board,
styrofoam, sawdust, paper, fiberglass or other types of insulation, or any
other similar material.
(Ord. 422, 3/2/1993, §2)
§103. Prohibition on Burning. After the effective date of this Part,
with the exception of a fire in a cook stove or grill for the purpose of
cooking food, no person shall kindle or maintain any open fire, or fire in
any incinerator, or authorize any such fire to be kindled or maintained
within the Borough of New Holland for the purpose of elimination or
disposal of any waste. This Section shall not be deemed to prohibit the
burning of any material in any furnace, or as a necessary part of any
industrial or manufacturing process, so long as such burning is not solely
for the purpose of elimination of waste or excess material. (Ord. 422,
3/2/1993, §3)
§104. Burning Permits.
1. No permits shall be issued pursuant to Ordinance No. 412, enacted
December 3, 1991, after the effective date of this Part. Any permits
previously issued shall continue according to their existing terms, and may
be renewed by existing permit holders. The foregoing not withstanding, all
burning permits shall expire December 31, 1994. The fee for the renewal of
any existing permit shall be prorated, if any renewal term shall be for
less than one (1) year pursuant to the expiration date as set forth herein.
2. The burning of any waste pursuant to any permit prior to
expiration thereof as hereinbefore set forth shall be in accordance with
the terns and conditions as set forth in Ordinance No. 412, enacted
December 3, 1991.
(Ord. 422, 3/2/1993, §4)
§105. Exceptions. Open fires, or fires in an incinerator, may be set
in the performance of an official duty of any public officer or public
employee, if the fire is necessary for:
A. The prevention of a fire hazard which cannot be abated by
other means.
B. Protection of the public health.
C. The proper training of police and volunteer fire company
personnel.
D. The elimination of any material, under supervision of the
Borough of New Holland, if Council for the Borough of New Holland
determines that there is no practical alternative for disposal of the
material proposed to be burned.
(Ord. 422, 3/2/1993, §5)
§106. Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate
any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to
- 60 -
(7, §106, cont'd) (7, §106, cont'd)
pay a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus costs
and, in default of said payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed thirty (30) days. Each day that a violation of
this Part continues shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 422,

any order issued pursuant to this Part, any district justice and any court
having jurisdiction of any matter brought before it pursuant to this Part, or
the Borough, may assess a civil penalty for the violation. The penalty may
be assessed whether or not the violation was willful, and regardless of
whether legal action is commenced to enforce this Part. The civil penalty
assessed shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day
for each violation. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Borough,
district justice, or court shall consider the willfulness of the violation;
damage to air, soil, water, or other natural resources of the Borough or

deterrence of future violations; cost to the Borough; the size of the source
or facility; the compliance history of the source; the severity and duration

- 64.8 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(7, §410(2), cont’d) (7, §410(2), cont’d)
fact of the violation to the extent not already established, the person shall
cause to be delivered the proposed amount of the penalty to the Borough
within such thirty (30) day period for placement in a noninterest bearing
escrow account, or post an appeal bond to the Council within thirty (30) days
in the amount of the proposed penalty, provided that such bond is executed by
a surety licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is
satisfactory to the Borough. If, through administrative or final judicial
review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no violation occurred
or that the amount of the penalty shall be reduced, the Borough shall, within
thirty (30) days after such determination, remit the appropriate amount to
the person. Failure to forward the money or the appeal bond at the time of
the appeal shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the
violation or the amount of the civil penalty unless the appellant alleges
financial inability to prepay the penalty or to post the appeal bond.
Council shall conduct a hearing to consider the appellant’s alleged inability
to pay within thirty (30) days of the date of the appeal. Council may waive
the requirement to prepay the civil penalty or to post an appeal bond if the
appellant demonstrates and the Council finds that the appellant is financially
unable to pay. Council shall issue an order within thirty (30) days
of the date of the hearing to consider the appellant’s alleged inability to
pay. The amount assessed after an administrative hearing or after waiver of
an administrative hearing shall be payable to the Borough and shall be
collectible in any manner provided by law for the collection of debts,
including without limitation the collection of interest on the penalty amount
computed in accordance with §6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(Public Law 99-514, 26 U.S.C. §1 et seq.), as amended from time to time, from
the date of assessment of the penalty. If any person liable to pay any such
penalty neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount,
together with interest and any costs that may accrue, shall constitute a debt
of such person, as may be appropriate, to the Borough. The debt shall
constitute a lien on all property owned by said person when a notice of lien
incorporating a description of the property of the person subject to the
action is duly filed with the prothontary of the Court of Common Pleas where
the property is located. The prothontary shall promptly enter upon the civil
judgment or order docket, at no cost to the Borough, the name and address of
the person, as may be appropriate, and the amount of the lien as set forth in
the notice of lien. Upon entry by the prothonotary, the lien shall attach to
the revenues and all real and personal property of the person, whether or not
the person is solvent.
(Ord. 545, 2/1/2011, §1)
§411. Unlawful Conduct. It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with
or to cause or assist in the violation of any of the provision of this Part
or to fail to comply with any order or other requirement of the Borough or
any Code Enforcement Officer; or to cause a public nuisance; or to hinder,
obstruct, prevent, or interfere with the Borough, its personnel, or any Code
Enforcement Officer in their performance of any duty pursuant to this Part,
including without limitation denying the Borough (or any of its Council
members, mayor, employees, agents, or representatives), any Code Enforcement
Officer, or any other person designated by the Borough access to the source
or facility. (Ord. 545, 2/1/2011, §1)

conduct a reasonable exterior inspection of the dwelling or other
improvements erected on the premises in order to determine if there is

fire is observed, the police officer or the Liberty Fire Company shall
have no duty or obligation to forcibly enter the dwelling or other
structure for the purpose of determining whether or not the alarm is a
false alarm, or if there is any fire within the dwelling or structure.

(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993; as amended by Ord. 509, 1/4/2005, §20)
§411. Residential Permit Parking.
1. Findings and Purpose. The Borough finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to
commuter vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the residents of those
areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree
of commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain
affected areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by
providing for parking preference during certain hours of the day and
days of the week. Therefore, the Borough considers it to be in the
interest of the people of the Borough to provide for the establishment
of a residential permit parking program to insure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide
a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms
listed in this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by
a person not a resident of that residential area;
PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
(1) parking permit for that business or professional office address;
RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address;
RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or
parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and non-business property (such as schools, parks, places
of worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection 4 of this
Section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking
on the basis of the following criteria:
- 124 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(15, §411(3)(A)) (15, §411(3)(A))
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30
p.m., Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to seventy percent (70%) or more of the legal, onstreet
parking capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion,
a legal parking space shall be twenty (20) linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in A, directly above, ten
percent (10%) or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person residing
in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding registration of
motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as
a residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
(1) the local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean
air and environment;
(2) the possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles
driven in the Borough;
(3) the likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
(4) the proximity of public transportation to the residential
area;
(5) the desire and need of the residents for residential
permit parking and their willingness to bear the administrative
costs in connection with it; and
(6) the need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public for
religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under
which parking shall be by permit only.
5. Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking
permit shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the
permit, who shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who
resides on or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or
other location within a residential parking permit area. A separate
application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and each application
Page Revised 7/1/2014 - 125 -
(15, §411(5), cont’d) (15, §411(5), cont’d)
shall be accompanied by a permit fee, set pursuant to a Resolution of the
Borough Council, which shall be for the use of the Borough, to be applied to
the cost of administering the residential permit parking program. Each
application shall contain the following information: the name of the owner or
the driver, as the case may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the
resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and
registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken from
the applicant’s current driver’s license. At the discretion of the Chief of
Police, the applicant shall be required, at the time of making application,
to present his driver’s license and the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the
permit fee, and determination by him that the information upon the
application shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking
permit, the Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential
parking permit, which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year.
The permit shall display the serial and registration numbers of the motor
vehicles, the residential parking area number, and the expiration date. The
permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon making
application for renewal and payment of the permit fee. It shall be unlawful
and a violation of this Section for any person to display other than the
current and valid permit while standing or parking in a residential permit
parking area at any time when those permits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established
pursuant to a Resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a designated
residential permit parking area, and exemption parking permits may be issued,
without payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
8. Responsibility of Permit Holder.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary,
the holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand
or park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential parking
permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be displayed so
as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the vehicle. A
residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder
a parking space within a designated residential permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder
to stand or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt
its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking regulation
other than residential permit parking regulation or restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on
the permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than the
permit holder shall constitute a violation of this Section by the permit
holder and by the person who so used or displayed the parking permit.

falsely to represent himself as eligible for a residential parking
permit or to furnish false information in an application to the Chief
of Police in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
(1) Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have
authority to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit
holder found to be in violation of any provision of this Section.
Upon written notification to him of the revocation, the permit
holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure
to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this
Section. Provided: any person receiving such a notice may, within
ten (10) days after the date of the notice, appeal to Borough
Council for a hearing on the revocation, and the decision of
Borough Council shall be final.

(18, §121, cont'd) (18, §121, cont'd)
or generated on the improved property connected to the sewer system, without
the prior express written consent of Borough.
13. Grease and Sand Traps. Grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps
shall be provided by a user when the Borough determines that such devices are
necessary for the proper handling of wastewaters containing greases, oils or
settleable solids. Interceptors and traps shall be installed, operated,
maintained and cleaned properly, so that they will consistently remove the
grease, oil or settleable solids. Interceptors and traps shall be properly
designed to accommodate the maximum flow rate expected to occur, and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
14. Garbage Grinders. The use of mechanical garbage grinders producing
a finely divided mass, properly flushed with an ample amount of water, shall
be permitted in the kitchen of a dwelling unit. Such devices shall also be
permitted in food preparation areas of commercial or industrial establishments
upon the registration of each such device with the Borough. Each
existing garbage grinder requiring registration shall be registered within
thirty (30) days of receipt by the owner thereof from the Borough of the
requirement of such registration as set forth herein.
15. Notification Requirements; Hazardous Wastes and Hazardous
Substances.
A. All industrial users shall notify the Borough, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Division Director, and the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources, Bureau of Waste Management, in writing, of any

would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification
shall include the name of the hazardous waste, as set forth in 40 CFR
Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month, the
notification shall also include the following information, to the extent
that it is known and readily available to the industrial user:
(1) An identification of the hazardous constituents contained
in the waste;
(2) An estimation of the mass and concentration in the
wastewater of all such constituents discharged in the most recent
month; and,
(3) An estimate of the mass and concentration of such
constituents expected to be discharged during the following twelve
(12) months.
B. Industrial users that commence discharge after the effective
date of this Part shall submit the report within one hundred eighty
(180) days of first discharge of the hazardous waste, except as provided
in subsection (D) of this subsection.
(18, §121, cont'd) (18, §121, cont'd)
C. The required report need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. Industrial users regulated under categorical
standards which have already submitted such information in baseline
monitoring reports or periodic compliance reports do not have to report
this information again.
D. Industrial users that discharge less than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes in a calendar month do not have to comply
with these reporting requirements. This exemption does not apply to
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
E. An industrial user shall notify the Borough immediately of
becoming aware of any discharges of reportable quantities of listed or
unlisted hazardous substances, as defined at 40 CFR §302.4 (CERCLA
Hazardous Substances). This notification shall include the time of
release; the name of the substance; the identifying CAS number, if
known; and the approximate quantity discharged. If the discharge
constitutes a spill, change in wastewater constituents or slug load,
other reporting requirements of this Part may also apply.
F. Each notification required by this Section shall include a
statement certifying that the industrial user has a program in place to
reduce the volume and/or toxicity of the discharged wastes to the extent
that it is economically practical. This statement shall be signed by
the authorized representative of the industrial user.

upon all owners of property in the Borough the following sewage and
industrial waste surcharges: [Ord. 453]
A. Calculation of Surcharge Amount. Any improved property and/or
industrial user which discharges sewage and/or industrial waste into the
sewer system, which contains pollutants in excess of the limits set
forth in §131(3) of subpart (C) of this Part shall pay a strength of
waste surcharge, in addition to the applicable sewer rental charge,
equal to the sum of one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent for each
milligram per liter (mg/L) by which the said limits for biochemical
oxygen demand, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, ammonianitrogen
and zinc are exceeded. The surcharge shall be applicable to
billings for sewer service in accordance with the provisions of §132(2).
B. Determination. In establishing sewage and industrial waste
strength for surcharge purposes, an analysis shall be made with
procedures outlined in the latest edition of Standard Methods. The
strength of sewage and industrial waste to be used for calculating the
amount of the surcharge shall be determined at least once annually
either:
(1) By suitable sampling and analysis of the sewage or
industrial waste for a twenty-four (24) hour period, during which
time the strength of the sewage or industrial waste discharged to
the sewer system is at a maximum;
(2) From relationship of products produced to strength of
industrial waste from those industrial users where such relationships
have been established; or
(3) From estimates.

2. Optional Wastewater Flow Meter. Any owner of an improved property
which discharges wastewater to the Borough sewer system may notify the
Borough, in writing, of his, her or its desire to have a wastewater flow
meter or other measuring device installed and to have the sewer rental charge
and surcharges, if applicable, calculated as set forth in subpart D of this
Part based upon the flow passing through such wastewater flow meter, or other
measuring device rather than the water consumed upon the improved property.
The Borough shall have the right to reject any request or application by any
owner for use of a wastewater flow meter, if the Borough determines that the
wastewater from the improved property is either insufficient for accurate
measurements by a wastewater flow meter or of a type inappropriate for
measurement by a wastewater flow meter. If at any time after installation,
the Borough determines that a wastewater flow meter cannot accurately measure
the wastewater discharge, the Borough shall have the right to require removal
of such wastewater flow meter.
3. Required Private Water Meter. If the Borough rejects any request
or application by any owner for use of a wastewater flow meter as outlined in
subsection (2) above, the owner of the improved property shall be required to
furnish and install a private water meter, which shall be the property of the
owner. If the owner of an improved property fails to install a private water
meter, the Borough shall have the right to enter upon the premises of the
improved property and install a water meter, the cost of said water meter and
installation thereof being paid for by the owner of the improved property.

devices shall have it inspected, tested and repaired as required, and the
results of said inspection, testing and repair submitted to the Borough in
writing. The cost of such inspection, testing, and repair should be paid by
the owner of the meter. The Borough shall also have the right to observe and
record information from said meter or other measuring devices at all
reasonable times. Should the owner of an improved property not maintain,
repair, replace or test said meter or other measuring device, the Borough may
undertake same and bill the owner accordingly.

keep the Borough advised of, his or her correct service and mailing address.
The Borough may consider, at its sole discretion, sending the bill for each
service to a tenant, upon request from the owner and the.tenant. In the
event billing to a tenant is approved, the owner shall nevertheless remain
ultimately responsible for payment of the entire bill for sewer service
provided to the property of the owner, regardless of whether or not the owner
received any billings for such service. [Ord. 453]
3. Penalty for Late Payment. In the event of any default in payment
of any sewer rental, rate, charge or surcharge within thirty (30) days after
the due date of such bill, a penalty of ten (10) percent of the total of such
outstanding sewer rental, rate, charge or surcharge will be added to all such
amounts due. Every thirty (30) days thereafter an additional penalty in the
amount of three (3) percent of the outstanding sewer rental, rate, charge or
surcharge are billed, excluding any prior penalties, shall be added to all
such amounts due.
4. Liens for Sewer Rentals and Charges. Sewer rentals or charges
imposed by this Part shall be a lien on the improved property connected to
and served by the sewer system; and any such sewer rentals or charges which
are not paid within thirty (30) days after each due date applicable to the

collecting of municipal claims.
5. Payment of Sewer Rentals and Charges on Vacant or Unoccupied
Improved Property. Sewer rental and charges shall accrue and be payable for
all periods during which an improved property has its building sewer
connected to the Borough sewer system, irrespective of occupancy. Provided,
however, that after the improved property has remained vacant and unoccupied
for one (1) full quarterly billing period, the Borough may relieve the owner
of the improved property from further sewer rental and charges during
continuance of vacancy or nonuse, if all water connections and sources from
which water is used on the improved property shall be shut off and sealed or

place, the Borough shall construct the connection sewer or have the owner of
the improved property construct the connection sewer along with the customer
sewer. If the Borough constructs the connection sewer, said owner will be
responsible for all fees provided for said connection sewer in addition to
all fees for said customer sewer as provided by this Part. The provisions
for notification and inspection and the payment of all cost and fees
associated with the construction undertaken by said owner shall be as set
forth in subsection (2) above.
4. Connection of Multiple Dwelling Unit. An existing multiple
dwelling unit now having a single building sewer may continue to be connected
to the Borough sewage collection system through this single building sewer.
Upon construction or reconstruction of the plumbing system within a dwelling
unit, the Borough may require each dwelling unit to be connected to the
sewage collection system by its own building sewer. A new multiple dwelling
unit shall make an application for a permit to connect to the sewage
collection system as provided in §142 of this Part. The permit issued by the
Borough for connection to the sewage collection system shall indicate the
number and size of the building sewers required for the new multiple dwelling
unit. The provisions for notification and inspection and the payment of all
cost and fees associated with the construction undertaken by the owner shall
be as set forth in subsections (2) or (3) above.

§144. Additional Connection Regulations.
1. Unlawful Conditions. If any owner or tenant of an improved
property should make any connection to the building sewer or the sewage
collection system without a permit from the Borough, or allow any pollutant
to be discharged into a building sewer or the sewage collection system except
as provided by this Part or violate any of the provisions with respect to
this Part or the Subdivision Ordinance [Chapter 22], and shall after ten (10)
days of receipt of written notice from the Borough fail or neglect to abate
such condition, the Borough may, at its option, enter upon the improved
- 175 -
(18, §144,(1), cont’d) (18, §144(1), cont’d)
property and abate the condition, charging the cost thereof to the owner of
the improved property; or the Borough may by appropriate legal action proceed
to compel said owner of said improved property to abate such condition. In
addition to any other remedies available, the Borough, upon failure or
neglect of said owner to comply with any provisions of this Part, may enter
the improved property and at the owner’s cost, disconnect the said improved
property from the sewage collection system and may require the payment of a
fee for reconnection and all cost and expenses as a condition for reconnection.
The Borough may file a municipal lien against the improved property
for any and all costs incurred by the Borough in abating such condition,
together with such additional charges as may be permitted by applicable law.
2. Penalty for Violation. Any person who shall violate any provision
of this Part shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus costs and, in default of
payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed
thirty (30) days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§145. Ownership, Maintenance and Repair of Connection Sewer.
The building sewer, consisting of both the customer sewer and the
connection sewer, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the improved
property being served thereby. Inspection, maintenance, repair and
replacement of the building sewer shall be the sole responsibility of the
owner of the improved property, and the owner shall maintain the same in good
order and operating condition. In the event of any failure by the owner to
so maintain the connection sewer portion of the building sewer, the Borough
of New Holland shall have the right, but not the obligation, to perform such
work as may be necessary to maintain, repair or replace the same. Any and
all costs so incurred by the Borough of New Holland shall be payable by the
owner, and in default thereof the Borough of New Holland shall have the right
to file a municipal lien against the improved property served by the building
sewer.

(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
(18, §152) (18, §152)
§152. Compliance Schedule.
1. Compliance Schedule. If a compliance schedule is required to be
contained or included with the application for a wastewater discharge permit,
or if under any other circumstances a compliance schedule is required to be
submitted to the Borough, the following criteria shall govern the preparation
of the compliance schedule.
A. The compliance schedule shall clearly show by line items, or
clearly describe by numbered categories, all the major phases or steps
which the applicant reasonably believes will be involved in order,
within the shortest possible period of time, (1) to place a new
pretreatment facility or process into operation and to achieve compliance
on a consistent basis, (2) to bring an existing facility or process
into compliance on a consistent basis, or (3) to achieve compliance in
some other respect or under some other circumstance.
Example. The line item phases or steps which could be involved
might include: a phase for the selection and retention of a
consulting engineer; a phase for the preparation of preliminary
design plans; a phase for the review and evaluation by the Borough
of the preliminary design plans; a phase for the preparation of
final design plans; a phase for the preparation of technical
specifications, project manuals and bid documents; a phase for the
invitation and receipt of bids; a phase for the acceptance of bids
and the award and execution of contracts; a phase for construction
or installation; and a phase for testing the facility or process.
B. A commencement date and a completion date shall be assigned to
each line item phase or step, or to each numbered category phase or
step, referred to in subsection (A). The period from commencement to
completion of a particular phase or step shall be the shortest possible
period of time. In no event, however, shall any phase or step exceed
nine (9) months in duration from commencement to completion. There
shall be no hiatus or interval between one (1) phase or step and the
next.
C. The compliance schedule shall show a final date by which
compliance will be achieved on a consistent basis. Under no circumstances,
however, shall this final date be later than any mandatory
compliance date fixed by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency for compliance with a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard;
any mandatory compliance date fixed by the Borough for compliance with
a prohibition, control, limit, flow equalization standard, pretreatment
standard or regulation issued or prescribed by the Borough; or any
mandatory compliance date fixed by a governmental agency of the State
for compliance with a prohibition, control, limit, standard or regulation
issued or prescribed by the agency.
2. Compliance Schedule Reports. If a compliance schedule is approved
by the Borough, the industrial user shall submit to the Borough periodic
compliance schedule reports. The content and frequency of these reports
shall be prescribed by the Borough.
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
- 182 -
(18, §153) (18, §153)
§153. Monitoring Facilities, Sampling and Analysis.
1. Monitoring Facilities Location. The Borough may require a
significant industrial user to provide and operate at the significant
industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the discharge from the significant
industrial user. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the
significant industrial user's premises, but the Borough may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the significant
industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
2. Monitoring Facilities Construction and Maintenance. Whether
constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be
provided in accordance with the Borough's requirements and all applicable
local construction standards and specifications. There shall be ample room
in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation
of samples for transport. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90)
days after cons truction plans have been approved by the Borough, in
accordance with this Part. The Borough may grant an extension to the time
limit as set forth herein upon showing by the significant industrial user
that acquisition of necessary equipment, and installation and construction as
may be required for such facility cannot be completed within ninety (90)
days. The monitoring facility shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the significant industrial user.
3. Detailed Plans. Detailed plans showing the intended facilities
shall be submitted to the Borough for review within the time period approved
by the Borough, and shall be acceptable to the Borough before construction of
the facility. The Borough shall notify the significant industrial user, in
writing, when the detailed plans are acceptable for construction.
4. Sampling and Analysis. All sampling and analysis performed in
compliance with wastewater discharge permit conditions or to prepare the
reports required by this Part shall be accomplished using techniques
specified in 40 CFR Part 136, or alternative procedures approved by the
Administrator, or using procedures described in Standard Methods if no EPAapproved
procedure exists. Unless otherwise required, all sampling should be
performed during a normal production day and should reflect the usual and
typical wastewater discharge of the user.
5. Reporting and Resampling of Discharge Limit Violations.
A. If, upon receipt of valid sampling and testing results, a
significant industrial user becomes aware that a violation of discharge
limits has occurred, the significant industrial user shall, within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation, notify the
Borough of this fact. Within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of this
violation, the significant industrial user shall also sample and analyze
(18, §153(5), cont'd) (18, §153(5), cont'd)
its discharge(s) for each parameter found to be in violation and report
the results of the resampling and analysis to the Borough.
B. Each significant industrial user shall have a duty, on receipt
of validly obtained sampling and analysis results, of inspecting the
results and determining if any wastewater discharge permit condition has
been violated. Failure to examine and compare testing results with
wastewater discharge permit conditions shall not be a valid defense for
failure to comply with these reporting conditions.
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§154. Administrative Appeals.
1. Appeal of Wastewater Discharge Permit. Any person, including the
significant industrial user, may petition the Borough to reconsider the terms
of a wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of its issuance.
Such an appeal shall be directed to the Sewer Committee of the Borough
Council for its review. Upon consideration of the petition, the Sewer
Committee shall make its recommendations to the Borough Council, whose
decision regarding the appeal will be final.
A. Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed
to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
B. In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the
wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this
objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in
the wastewater discharge permit.
C. The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not
be stayed pending the appeal.
D. If the Borough fails to act within sixty (60) days following
presentation of the petition to the Sewer Committee, a request for
reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to
reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater
discharge permit or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall
be considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial
review.
E. Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing
a complaint with the court of competent jurisdiction.
2. Continuation of Permit During Appeal. During the process of appeal,
the wastewater discharge permit shall remain in effect and shall be enforced
with the exception of those conditions specified in writing in the appeal.
Conditions imposed by Federal or State regulations (e.g., categorical
standards) shall not be waived. Conditions which, in the opinion of the
Borough, would constitute a hazard or pose a potential threat of pollution if
waived shall not be waived during an appeal.
(18, §154, cont'd) (18, §154, cont'd)
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§155. Inspections, Pretreatment Facilities, Changes.
1. Inspections. The Borough may inspect the facilities of any user to
ascertain whether the purpose of this Part is being met and that the user is
in compliance with all requirements. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharge shall allow the Borough or its representatives
ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, or in
the performance of its duties. The Borough and its agents shall have the
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry onto their premises, the
user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Borough will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their
specific responsibilities.
2. Pretreatment Facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with this Part and shall
achieve compliance with all applicable categorical standards within the time
limitations as specified by the applicable categorical standards. Any
facilities required for pretreatment shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Borough for review, and shall be subject to approval by the Borough, before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce a discharge which complies
with the provisions of this Part. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported and be acceptable to the
Borough prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. The review
and acceptance of plans and procedures by the Borough shall not be considered
as an approval regarding their efficacy, safety or reliability; such
considerations are solely the responsibility of the industrial user.
3. Change in Operations.
A. Any industrial user contemplating or planning a change in the
manufacturing process, raw materials, auxiliary processes, pretreatment
processes or other changes which may result in changes to wastewater
character, composition, volume or rate of flow shall notify the Borough
in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to making such a change, or,
if the change is not planned, immediately upon the decision to make such
a change. If a change in wastewater characteristics occurs without the
knowledge of the industrial user, the industrial user shall report the
change immediately upon becoming aware of it. The report shall include
all necessary information to determine the effect on the change on the
wastewater.
(18, §155(5), cont'd) (18, §155(5), cont'd)
B. The Borough may, on receipt of such a report:
(1) Continue an existing wastewater discharge permit in
effect.
(2) Require application for a new wastewater discharge
permit.
(3) Modify an existing wastewater discharge permit to reflect
the changed nature of the waste.
(4) Rescind and re-issue an existing wastewater discharge
permit in order to make substantial changes in wastewater discharge
permit conditions.
(5) Revoke an existing wastewater discharge permit or require
the industrial user to cease or prevent the discharge.
(6) Take such other action as it deems appropriate.
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§156. Reports.
1. Baseline Monitoring Reports.
A. As soon as possible following the promulgation of a categorical
standard, the industrial user subject to such standards shall comply
with such categorical standard within the time frame prescribed by the
categorical standard.
B. Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated
categorical standard, has not previously submitted an application for
a wastewater discharge permit as required by §151 of this Part, the
industrial user shall, within one hundred (180) days after the promulgation
of the applicable categorical standard:
(1) Apply for a wastewater discharge permit; and
(2) Provide the baseline monitoring information required by
40 CFR §403.12(b). This information may be incorporated into the
application for a wastewater discharge permit.
C. An industrial user with an existing wastewater discharge permit
shall submit to the Borough within one hundred eighty (180) days after
the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard the information
required by 40 CFR §403.12(b).
D. A new source or an industrial user that becomes a categorical
industrial user through a change in facilities or processes shall submit
a report containing the information required by 40 CFR §403.12(b)
(18, §156(1), cont'd) (18, §156(1), cont'd)
at least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge from the
regulated process or facility.
2. Categorical Compliance Report. Within ninety (90) days following
the date for final compliance with applicable categorical standards, or in
the case of a new source, following commencement of the discharge of
industrial waste from processes regulated by categorical standards into the
sewer system, any industrial user subject to categorical standards shall
submit to the Borough a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
categorical standards and the average and maximum daily flow for those
process units in the industrial user's facility which are limited by such
categorical standards. The report shall certify that the information
contained therein concerning wastewater constituents and flows is representative
of discharges during normal work cycles. The report shall also state
whether the applicable categorical standards are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional operation and management practices and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with
the applicable categorical standards, and including a schedule for completion
of the required actions in the form described in this Part. Such a schedule
shall not have a compliance date later than that established for the
applicable categorical standard. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a
certified professional.
3. Periodic Compliance Report.
A. All significant industrial users shall report to the Borough
at least twice a year, the date of the report to be as determined by the
Borough and contained in the wastewater discharge permit. Reports may
be required more frequently, if deemed necessary by the Borough.
B. The reports required under this Section shall contain, at a
minimum, the measured concentration of all pollutants regulated by the
wastewater discharge permit, a record of all measured daily flows which
exceeded the average daily flow value reported and a statement of
accuracy and completeness signed and certified by the authorized
representative of the significant industrial user.
C. For significant industrial users subject to categorical
standards, if discharge limits are based on mass units per production
unit, then production information regarding the regulated processes
during the reporting period shall be included in the report, along with
flow and concentration values, so that a determination of compliance or
noncompliance with categorical standards can be made.
D. For significant industrial users subject to categorical
standards, the certification of compliance with those standards, signed
by a certified professional.

§157. Confidential Information.
1. Availability of Information. Information and data on an industrial
user obtained from reports, questionnaires, wastewater discharge, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Borough that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. When requested by the
person furnishing a report, and supported by evidence acceptable to the
Borough as to need for protection of confidential material, the portion of
the report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection by the public but shall nevertheless be made

Sidewalk and Curb Construction
§101. Responsibility of Property Owners. Owners of land abutting on
streets in the Borough of New Holland shall be responsible for the construction
of sidewalks and the construction of curbs, along all streets abutting
the premises, or the placing of existing curbs and sidewalks in good
condition, upon the completion of any new structure, unless a delay is
granted by Council upon its own motion. Owners of land abutting on streets
in the Borough of New Holland shall be responsible for the construction of
sidewalks and construction of curbs along properties with existing structures,
at such time as such construction shall be required by Council.
Owners of land within the Borough on which sidewalks and/or curbs are
constructed, and persons in possession of any such premises, shall properly
maintain such curbs and sidewalks, and shall be responsible for the repair
thereof in a manner satisfactory to Council in accordance with specifications
as set forth in this Part. All sidewalks and curbs or sections thereof
hereafter constructed, reconstructed or repaired shall conform to the
requirements of this Part. All owners or occupiers of land within the
Borough of New Holland on which any sidewalk is constructed shall prevent any
obstruction of the sidewalk by trees, shrubs, lights, or any other obstruction,
to a height of seven (7) feet, except as provided in §112 of this Part.
(Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §1)
§102. Sidewalk Construction.
1. Dimensions and Base. Every sidewalk hereafter constructed or
reconstructed shall be of such width as Council shall determine, but in no
event of less width than four and one-half (4 1/2) feet, except that a width
of four (4) feet is acceptable where there is a minimum two (2) foot wide
grass strip between the sidewalk and curb approved as part of a subdivision
and land development plan or unless an exception for cause is granted by
Council. All sidewalks must be located against the inside edge of the curb
abutting the street. Replacement of existing sidewalks shall be of the same
width as previously existed, unless an exception is granted by Council. A
width greater than four and one-half (4 1/2) feet may be required in
commercial and manufacturing areas by Council. All sidewalks hereafter
constructed or reconstructed shall have a pitch of one-quarter (1/4) inch per
foot upward from the edge nearest the cartway. The top surface of all such
sidewalks shall represent a true plane within one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten
(10) feet. Upon request by a property owner, Council may allow, by
exception, a grass area between the curb and sidewalk. All sidewalks shall
be at least four (4) inches thick and shall be constructed or reconstructed
upon a firmly compacted base of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) 057 crushed stone, not less than four (4) inches in depth, as shown
on the drawing “Curb and Sidewalk Standard,” which is hereto attached and
made a part of this Part. The compacted stone base must be inspected and
approved by the Borough prior to the pouring of the concrete. [Ord. 427]
A. Stamped Concrete Sidewalks. Stamped concrete sidewalk
surfaces only (not curbing) shall be allowed when utilizing the
following requirements in addition to the foregoing sidewalk installation
specifications:
Page Revised 7/1/2014 - 211 -
(21, §102(1)(A), cont’d) (21, §102(1)(A), cont’d)
(1) The stamped concrete shall be a minimum of four thousand
(4,000) psi and a minimum of four (4) inches deep; provided,
however, that across a driveway, the stamped concrete shall be a
minimum of six (6) inches deep with #10 wire mesh installed
throughout the area across said driveway, with 2B stone.
(2) A one-half (1/2) inch thick expansion joint material
(consisting of either a PennDOT approved material or other material
approved by the Borough Manager) shall be installed between all new
sidewalk and any existing or new curb, as well as within the
sidewalk not less than every fifty (50) feet as noted herein.
(3) The width of the stamped concrete pattern shall not be
more than one-half (1/2) inch wide and shall not be more than onequarter
(1/4) inch deep.
(4) The top surface of stamped concrete sidewalk shall not
be smooth, but must be and maintained as a broomed or a similar
rough-type surface.
(5) These hereinabove-described stamped concrete specifications
in subparagraphs (1) through (4) shall supercede any and all
other inconsistent or contradictory specifications in this Part
only with respect to stamped concrete sidewalks, but any such
inconsistent or contrary specifications shall otherwise remain
valid and in full force and effect with respect to and as otherwise
applicable to all non-stamped concrete sidewalks.
[Ord. 534]
2. Expansion Joints. All sidewalks hereafter constructed or
reconstructed, regardless of width, shall be scored one-half (1/2) inch in
width and depth across the width dimension of such sidewalk every five (5)
feet. Such sidewalks shall be completely cut through where sidewalk joins
driveway and at a distance not to exceed fifty (50) feet to provide an
expansion joint which shall be filled with material suitable for that
purpose. Wherever such sidewalk abuts curbing, a one-quarter (1/4) inch
expansion joint shall also be provided to run between the sidewalk and
curbing and shall be filled with material suitable for that purpose.
Acceptable expansion material shall be one-quarter (1/4) inch bituminous
impregnated, premolded style or equal, as approved by the Borough.
3. Driveways. All sidewalks hereafter constructed or reconstructed
in driveways shall be at least six (6) inches thick, reinforced with six-inch
by six-inch (6 x 6) No. 10 wire mesh in residential areas and six-inch by
six-inch (6 x 6) No. 6 wire mesh in commercial and manufacturing areas.
[Ord. 488]
4. Nonconforming Sidewalks. All sidewalks hereafter constructed or
reconstructed shall be built with concrete in accordance with Borough
standards as contained herein. The owner of land containing any sidewalk
heretofore lawfully constructed of a material other than concrete, may repair
same with a matching material, if in the opinion of the Borough Manager, at
least two-thirds (2/3) of such sidewalk remains in good repair. Otherwise,
such sidewalks shall be entirely reconstructed according to standards set
forth in this Part. If the curb is also nonconforming, it shall also be
entirely reconstructed at that time, regardless of its condition unless a
delay is granted by Council upon request by the property owner.
- 212 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(21, §102, cont’d) (21, §102, cont’d)
(Ord. 356, 11/4/198E, §2; as amended by Ord. 427, 12/28/1993; by Ord. 488,
9/3/2002, §1; and by Ord. 534, 4/9/2009, §1)
§103. Curb Construction. Curbing shall be constructed of concrete and
in the following manner:
A. Standard Straight Curb.
(1) Dimensions. The overall depth of the curbing shall be
at least twenty-two (22) inches, the lower fourteen (14) inches of
said depth being eight (8) inches wide and the remaining eight (8)
inches at the top shall be beveled from a width of eight (8) inches
to a width of seven (7) inches on top of the curb as shown in the
drawing “Curb and Sidewalk Standards” which is attached to and made
a part of this Part.
(2) Base. All standard straight curb shall be constructed
on a firmly compacted layer of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
approved #57 crushed stone, four (4) inches in depth. The
crushed stone base must be inspected and approved by the Borough
prior to the pouring of concrete.
(3) Expansion Joints. Curbing shall be constructed in ten
(10) foot lengths. A premolded expansion material having a minimum
thickness of one-fourth (1/4) inch shall be placed between sections
of curved curb and at intervals of not more than one hundred (100)
feet. Intermediate joints between ten (10) foot sections shall be
formed of two (2) layers of one (1) ply bituminous paper.
(4) Driveways. The standard straight curb at driveways shall
be depressed at the location of said driveway so as to
[Text continued on p. 213]
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 212.1 -
- 212.2 -
(21, .103(A), cont'd) (21, §103(A), cont'd)
provide a sloping section at each side with a slope of five (5)
inches per foot depressing the curb five (5) inches. [Ord. 427]
B. Standard Roll Curb.
(1) Where Permitted. Standard rolled curb shall be
permitted by permission of the Council in lieu of standard
straight curb; provided, however, that no such installation shall
be permitted unless all curb on both sides of the complete block
will be of rolled curb construction.
(2) Dimensions. The standard rolled curb shall be twentyfour
(24) inches wide at the base. The face away from the
cartway shall be vertical and extend upward to a height of twelve
(12) inches. The face adjacent to the cartway shall be vertical
and extend upward to a height of eight and one-half (8-1/2)
inches. The curb line shall be seven (7) inches from the
vertical back face of the curb, and the top of these seven (7)
inches shall be level for a distance of three (3) inches. There
shall then be a sloping drop to a flow line four (4) inches below
the highest portion of the curb, thereafter reversing again,
curving upward to the leading face at a height of eight and
one-half (8-1/2) inches, as shown in the drawing "Curb and
Sidewalk Standards" which is attached hereto and made a part of
this Part. [Ord. 427]
(3) Uniformity and Base. The standard rolled curb sections
shall be constructed in such a manner as to insure uniformity and
continuity of the invert curb flow line and shall be constructed
on a compacted layer of three-quarter (3/4) inch Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation approved #57 crushed stone, four (4)
inches in depth. The crushed stone base must be inspected and
approved by the Borough prior to the pouring of concrete.
(4) Cuts and Expansion Joints. All standard rolled curb
shall be cut completely through or scored to a depth of at least
two (2) inches every ten (10) feet of length, and one-quarter
(1/4) inch minimum expansion joint, filled with material suitable
for that purpose shall be provided for every sixty (60) feet of
straight line curbing.
(5) Driveways. The standard rolled curb shall continue
unchanged across the entrance to any driveway. Commercial and
industrial driveways of either rolled or straight curb shall at a
minimum include three (3) lengths of one-half inch by twelve inch
(1/2 x 12) of rebar evenly spaced and inserted between all
sections of curbing within the drive entrance area, as well as
the sections of curbing, immediately adjacent to the drive
entrance curbing, as shown in the drawing "Curb and Sidewalk
Standards" which is attached hereto and made a part of this Part.
(6) Alternative Rolled Curb Driveway Entrance. A property
owner shall have the right to request permission from Council for
the initial construction of an alternative rolled curb drive
entrance, in lieu of the continuation of the standard rolled curb
across the entrance of a driveway, as set forth in §103(B)(5).
The dimensions for such alternative curb shall be the same as set
- 213 -
(21, §103(B), cont'd) (21, §103(B), cont'd)
forth in §103(B)(2) regarding the width of the base of the curb,
the depth of the curb at the face of adjacent to the cartway, and
the depth of the curb at the center of the flow line. At a point
twelve (12) inches away from the vertical face adjacent to the
cartway, the level of the rolled curb shall be the same as the
level of the cartway. From such point, extending for a distance
as hereinafter set forth, the rolled curbing, and the driveway,
shall be sloped upward to a total depth of twelve (12) inches
from the base of the curb, being the total depth of the standard
rolled curb. If the sidewalk abuts the curbing, the increase in
elevation to the twelve (12) inch depth shall be over a distance
of two (2) feet six (6) inches. If there is a grass strip planted
between the sidewalk and curbing, the increase in elevation to a
twelve (12) inch depth shall be over a distance of three (3)
feet. Such slopes shall be uniform. At each side edge of the
driveway, the alternative rolled curb driveway entrance shall be
blended with the standard rolled curb. All sidewalks abutting
the alternative rolled curb driveway entrance shall be sloped and
blended over such distance as shall be specified by the
Superintendent of Public Works, so that the slope shall be
sufficiently gradual so as to permit pedestrian traffic without
unreasonable risk. The blending of the curb to the standard
rolled curb shall be over a distance of not more than six (6)
inches. Any alternative rolled curb driveway entrance giving
access to any commercial or industrial property shall include
three (3) lengths of one-half (1/2) inch rebar as set forth in
§103(B)(5). [Ord. 385]
(7) Driveway Entrance Replacement. An owner of property
may request permission from Council for the Borough of New
Holland to replace an existing standard rolled curb entrance to a
driveway, with the alternative rolled curb driveway entrance.
Such replacement shall comply with specifications as set forth in
subsection (6). Upon removal of the existing standard rolled
curb, a one-eighth (1/8) inch steel plate, running the entire
length of the section of standard rolled curb which has been
removed, to the same depth as the standard rolled curb which was
removed, shall be placed immediately adjacent to the cartway to
insure the integrity of street surface and base. The plate shall
be pinned in place at each end, and every eighteen (18) inches,
with steel pins one-quarter (1/4) inch in diameter, and fifteen
(15) inches in length, extending into the existing street base.
Three (3) one-half (1/2) inch rebars shall be placed so as to
extend six (6) inches into the existing standard rolled curb at
each side of the driveway entrance, and shall extend six (6)
inches into the alternative rolled curb driveway entrance. The
rebar shall be placed four and one-half (4 1/2) inches from the
base of the curb, and four and one-half (4 1/2) inches from each
end of the curb. The three (3) rebars shall be placed six (6)
inches apart of the centers of such rebar. The replacement
alternative rolled curb driveway entrance shall be blended with
the existing standard rolled curb, and with the existing
sidewalk, in the same manner as set forth in subsection (6).
[Ord. 385]
- 214 -
(21, §103 (C) (21, §103 (C)
C. Radii Curbing. Curbing within radii shall be constructed or
reconstructed in the same manner as specified herein for standard
straight curb or standard rolled curb, regardless of radii length.
Standard straight curb radii shall not have a beveled face. Either
curb type radii shall be constructed in ten (10) foot lengths with
joints formed of two (2) ply layers of bituminous paper. There shall
also be a one-quarter (1/4) inch expansion joint placed at each end of
a radii where it meets straight line curbing of either the standard
straight curve or standard rolled curb type. Depressed ramps for the
handicapped shall be installed according to the applicable State and
Federal requirements at the location or locations as directed by the
Borough; provided, however, that when necessary the Borough shall make
corrective modifications from the specifications.
D. Repair of Nonconforming Curbs. Curbs heretofore lawfully
constructed with materials or in dimensions different from those set
forth herein may be repaired or reconstructed with matching materials
or in matching dimensions by the owner of such property if, in the
opinion of the Borough Manager, at least two-thirds (2/3) of such curb
is still in good repair. Otherwise, such curb shall be entirely
reconstructed as required above in accordance with the standards set
forth in this Part.
(Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §3; as amended by Ord. 385, 6/6/1989, §1; and by Ord.
427, 12/28/1993)
§104. Concrete Mix. All materials shall have a minimum compressive
strength of three thousand five hundred (3,500) pounds per square inch
after twenty-eight (28) days. An air entrained admixture shall be
included. (Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §4)
§105. Conformity to Established Grades and Lines. All sidewalks and
curbs shall conform to grades and lines provided by the Borough where
streets now exist, except in cases where a subdivision for development is
proposed. The developer must assume the responsibility of grades and
lines, but is subject to Borough approval prior to subdivision approval.
(Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §5)
§106. Permits Required. No sidewalk or curb shall be constructed,
reconstructed or repaired in the Borough unless the owner, contractor or
other person responsible for said construction or repair shall first obtain
a Borough permit from the Borough Manager, and if upon a State roadway must
obtain the required State permit, upon such form of application as the
Council, and the State if applicable, shall determine. Such Borough permit
may also authorize the use of a portion of the street or adjoining sidewalk
for materials and equipment. Such permit shall be issued only when the
Manager shall be reasonably satisfied that the proposed construction will
conform to all requirements of this and any other applicable ordinance.
(Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §6)
§107. Safety Precautions Required During Construction and
Reconstruction. The contractor, if any, and, if not, the owner, shall be
responsible to see that all excavations for sidewalks and curbs, and all
construction placed on streets or sidewalks in connection with any
construction, reconstruction or repair thereof shall be adequately guarded
- 215 -
(21,:§107, cont'd) (21, §107, cont'd)
by day and lighted at night so as to fully guard against accident. Night
lighting shall be by flashing amber or steady burn lights placed at the
ends of such excavations and obstructions, and at intervals of not over
fifty (50) feet between ends, and if on a State roadway, must also comply
with all applicable Pennsylvania Department of Transportation requirements.
(Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §7)
§108. Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate
any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to
pay a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus costs
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed thirty (30) days. Each day that a violation of
this Part continues shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 356,
11/4/1986, §8; as amended by Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§109. Removal and Replacement of Faulty Construction. If any curb or
sidewalk shall be constructed, reconstructed or repaired without conforming
to the requirements of this Part, or of any other ordinance or law, the
Borough Manager may require the owner of the premises and other persons
responsible for such construction to remove the faulty curb or paving as a
nuisance, and replace it with conforming construction, and on failure of
such person to do so within such time as the Manger or Council shall fix,
the Borough may proceed to do so and collect the cost thereof by entry of
lien or otherwise. (Ord. 356, 11/4/1986, §9)
§110. Time Limit to Do Work; Authority for Borough to Perform Work
and Collect Cost Thereof From Defaulting Property Owners. Six (6) months
notice in writing to construct or repair sidewalks or curbs shall be given
by the Borough Manager except where repairs are required which in the
opinion of the Borough Manager are of an emergency nature, in which event
forty-eight (48) hours written notice shall be given. Upon the neglect of
any owner or owners of property to construct, reconstruct, or repair any
sidewalks or curbs, or upon the neglect of any owner or owners to keep
sidewalks and curbs in a safe and useable condition, the Borough shall,
after notice as herein provided, cause the construction or repair of the
sidewalk and/or curbs to be done at the cost of such property owner or
owners and shall collect the cost thereof, together with all charges and
expenses from such owner or owners, and may file a municipal lien therefor
in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, or collect
the same by action in assumpsit according to the Acts of Assembly of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pertaining thereto. (Ord. 356, 11/4/1986,
§10)
§111. Notice to Property Owners. All notices referred to in this
Part shall be served upon the owner of the property to which the notice
refers if such owner is a resident of the Borough of New Holland. If the
owner is not a resident, then the notice may be served upon the agent or
tenant of the owner, or upon the occupant of such property. If the owner
has no agent or tenant or there is no occupant of the property, then
service shall be given by notice posted upon the property. Any notice,

§103. Application Procedure and Approval Process.
1. Compliance with Procedures.
A. In order to discharge the duties imposed by law, the Borough
Council of the Borough of New Holland has adopted the following
procedures, which shall be observed by all subdividers and land
developers. No subdivision or land development shall be permitted
within the Borough of New Holland unless a plan for such subdivision or
land development has been prepared and approved in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
B. All plans and surveys shall be prepared in accordance with the
Act of May 23, 1945 (P.L. 913, No. 367), known as the “Professional
Engineers Registration Law.”
2. General Procedures.
A. Classification of Subdivision and Land Development. Whenever
any subdivision of land or land development is proposed, and before any
permit for the erection of a structure in such proposed subdivision or
land development shall be granted, the developer, or his authorized
agent, shall apply for and secure approval of such proposed subdivision
or land development in accordance with the following procedure, which
includes basically two (2) steps for a minor subdivision or land
development and three (3) steps for a major subdivision or land
development.
(1) Minor Subdivision or Land Development.
(a) Final Plan.
[Ord. 427]
(2) Major Subdivision or Land Development.
(a) Sketch Plan.
(b) Preliminary Plan.
(c) Final Plan.
B. Official Submission Dates.
(1) For the purpose of these regulations, for both major and
minor subdivisions and land development plans, the plans shall not
be deemed to have been submitted and Council shall not be required
to accept any incomplete submission, and the same shall be refused
as incomplete by Council if any insufficient number of copies of
any required attachments, plans, or applications are not submitted
or if the requisite fee is not paid in full. If Council holds any

the same shall not be deemed to have been received by the Secretary
for any purpose until the date and time of the submission of the
last item required to be submitted.
(2) Upon receipt of the complete subdivision or land
development application, plans and requisite approvals and the
Page Revised 7/1/2014 - 247 -
(22, §103(2), cont’d) (22, §103(2), cont’d)
number of copies mandated hereunder, together with the appropriate
fee in full, the Secretary shall note the date and time of
submittal, and shall also note the date and time of the next
Planning Commission or Borough Council meeting, whichever first
occurs, which said meeting date shall for purposes of computation
of time and all other relevant purposes be deemed the date of
submittal.
3. Sketch Plan.
A. Scope and Authority.
(1) The submission of a sketch plan is not mandatory and is
intended to facilitate the review and approval of preliminary
and/or final plans. Developers are strongly urged to submit a
sketch plan in sufficient detail for a determination to be made by
Borough Council concerning the classification of the proposed
subdivision or land development.
(2) In any event, all subdivisions and land developments for
which sketch plans have not been submitted in sufficient detail to
enable such classification shall be deemed major subdivisions or
land developments, and shall be required to comply with all
preliminary and final plan requirements of these regulations. The
submission of a sketch plan shall not preclude the applicant from
proceeding with preliminary and final plan application as required
prior to the approval of the sketch plan by Borough Council.
B. Discussion of Plan Contents. Before preparing the sketch plan
for a subdivision or land development, the applicant should discuss with
the Planning Commission the procedure for adoption of a subdivision or
land development plan and the requirements as to general layout of
streets and for reservations of land, street improvements, drainage,
sewerage, fire protection, and similar matters, as well as the availability
of existing services. The Planning Commission may also advise
the applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed subdivision
or land development with those officials who must eventually approve
these aspects of the plan coming within their jurisdiction.
C. Application Procedure and Requirements. No formal sketch plan
application is required. However, prior to developing land, an owner
of the land, or his representative, may file an application for approval
of a sketch plan. The application should be in conformance with the
following:
(1) Be made on forms available at the Borough Office.
(2) Include all contiguous holdings of the owner, including
land in the “same ownership,” as defined herein, with an indication
of the portion which is proposed to be subdivided, accompanied by
an affidavit of ownership, which should include the dates the
respective holdings of land were acquired, together with the book
and page of each conveyance to the present owner as recorded in the
County Recorder of Deed’s office. The affidavit should advise as
to the legal owner of the property, the contract owner of the
property, and the date the contract of sale was executed. If the
applicant is the equitable owner, or agent of the record owner, a
statement from the record owner should be
- 248 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(22, §103(3), cont'd) (22, §103(3), cont'd)
submitted which authorizes the submission of the application.
(3) Be accompanied by a minimum of ten (10) copies of the
sketch plan as described in these regulations and complying in
all respects with these regulations.
(4) Be presented to the Borough Secretary in duplicate.
(5) Include an address and telephone number of an agent who
shall be authorized to receive all notices required by these
regulations.
D. Classifications. Tentative classification of the sketch plan
shall be made at this time by the Planning Commission as to whether
the subdivision or land development is a major or minor subdivision or
land development as defined in these regulations. Subsequent to
classification of the subdivision or land development by the Planning
Commission, the Borough Council shall place the matter on its next
available regular meeting agenda for formal approval of the sketch
plan classification and any waivers of the provisions of this Chapter.
Subsequent to such approval by Borough Council, the applicant may
proceed directly to the filing of an application for approval of a
final subdivision or land development plan as provided in these
regulations. If classified as a major subdivision or land
development, the applicant must first file an application for approval
of a preliminary plan, as provided in these regulations, before filing
for final plan approval.
E. Study of Sketch Plan. The Planning Commission shall consider
the sketch plan and shall submit its recommendation to Borough Council
at its next regular meeting following the completion of the Planning
Commission's review. The recommendations of the Planning Commission
shall:
(1) Recommend the appropriate classification of the
proposed subdivision or land development.
(2) Identify plan submittals and site improvements which
may be required by this Chapter.
(3) Recommend any appropriate waivers to the provisions of
this Chapter.
F. Substance of Planning Commission Review. The Planning
Commission shall study the sketch plan, taking into consideration the
requirements of this Chapter and the best use of the land being
subdivided. Particular attention will be given to the arrangement,
location, and width of streets, their relation to the topography of
the land, sewage disposal, drainage, retention of storm water, lot
sizes and arrangement, natural features, the further development of
adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, and the requirements of the
Official Map and Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the Borough.
G. Approval of Sketch Plan. After reviewing and discussing the
sketch plan and recommendations of the Planning Commission, Borough
Council will advise the applicant of the specific changes or
additions, if any, it will require in the layout, and the character
and extent of required improvements and reservations which it will
require as a prerequisite to the approval of the subdivision plan or
- 249 -
(22, §103(3), cont'd) (22, §103(3), cont'd)
land development. Council may require additional changes as a result
of further study of the subdivision or land development in final form.
Said approval shall constitute authorization to prepare and submit a
final plan in the case of a minor subdivision or land development and
authorize appropriate waivers to the provisions of these regulations.
4. Preliminary Plan.
A. Application Procedure and Requirements. The applicant shall
submit to the Borough two (2) copies of the prescribed application.
The application shall:
(1) Be made on forms available at the Borough Office

shall determine the amount of quantity of the several kinds of
work and the quality of materials which are to be paid for under
the contract; he shall determine all questions in relation to the
project and the construction thereof, and decide every question
which may arise relative to the performance of the work covered
by the contract on the part of the contractor.
(2) Any doubt as to the meaning of these specifications and
the drawings, or any obscurity as to the wording or intent of
thm, will be explained by the engineer, and all directions and
explanations requisite or necessary to complete, explain, or make
definite any of the provisions of these specifications and
drawings and give them due effect, will be given by the engineer
in writing.
B. Authority to Suspend Work. The engineer shall have the
authority to suspend the work, wholly or in part, due to the failure
on the part of the contractor to carry out orders given, or to perform
any provisions of the contract; or due to unforeseen conditions which
had not been provided for in estimating the contract time required for
- 269 -
(22, §107(1), ccnt'd) (22, §107(1), cont'd)
the completion of the work. In any event, the contractor will be
notified in writing of the action to be undertaken and the justification
therefore.
2. Drawings.
A. Drawings will show details of all lines, grades, typical
cross-sections of the roadway, location, and design of all structures
and related quantities appearing in the proposal. The contractor
shall keep one (1) set of drawings available on the work at all times.
B. The drawings shall be supplemented by such working drawings
as are necessary to adequately control the work. Working drawings for
structures shall be furnished to the contractor and shall consist of
such detailed drawings as may be required to adequately control the
work. They shall include stress sheets, shop, erection, falsework,
and cofferdam drawings, bending diagrams for reinforcing steel, or any
other supplementary drawings or similar data required of the
contractor. All working drawings must be approved by the engineer and
such approval shall not operate to relieve the contractor of any of
his responsibility under the contract for the successful completion of
the work.
3. Conformity with Drawings and Specifications.
A. General. The contractor shall, within reasonably close
conformity, perform all items of work in accordance with the following
requirements:

close conformity, in each individual case, and his judgment shall
be final and conclusive.
(2) In the event the engineer finds the materials or the
finished product in which the materials are used not within
reasonably close conformity with the drawings and specifications,
but that reasonably acceptable work has been produced, he shall
then make a determination if the work shall be accepted and
remain in place.
(3) In the event the engineer finds the materials or the
finished in which the materials are used or the work performed
are not within reasonably close conformity with the drawings and
specifications, and have resulted in an inferior or unsatisfactory
product, the work shall be removed and replaced, or
- 270 -
(22, §107(3), cont'd) (22, §107(3), cont'd)
otherwise corrected, by and at the expense of the contractor.
4. Coordination of Drawings and Specifications.
A. The contractor shall perform the work in accordance with the
intent of the drawings and specifications, and shall not take
advantage of any error on or omission in the drawings or discrepancy
between the drawings and specifications. In the event the contractor
discovers such an error or omission, he shall immediately notify the
engineer. When required, the engineer will make such corrections and
interpretations deemed necessary for the fulfillment of the drawings
and specifications. Where dimensions on the drawings are given or can
be computed, scaled measurements shall not be used.

engineer, and who shall be vested with full authority by the
contractor to execute such orders without delay and make
arrangements for all necessary materials, equipment, and labor.
(2) At all times, the contractor shall keep on the project
a copy of the drawings, a copy of the specifications, and a copy
of the contract.
B. Work not Under the Supervision of the Borough. The contractor's
attention is directed to any work which must necessarily be done
and which will not be performed under the supervision of the Borough.
He shall investigate such matters fully and satisfy himself as to the
performance of such work so he can anticipate its execution and
completion, and shall not make claim or hold the Borough liable for
his failure to anticipate the time of performance and completion of
such work.
6. Public or Private Facilities and Structures on the Project.
A. Facilities and Structures Interfering with Contractor's
Operations.
(1) The contractor is required to fully inform himself
concerning the location of public or private facilities and
structures on, under, or over the project which may or may not
require relocation, adjustment, and/or reconstruction, and which
- 271 -
(22, §107(6), cont'd) (22, §107(6), cont'd)
may interfere with his operation, and it shall be assumed that he
has prepared his bid and entered into the contract in full understanding
of the conditions to be encountered and his responsibility
in connection therewith. It shall be the duty of the
contractor to inform all public service companies, individuals,
and others owning or controlling any facilities or structures
within the limits of the project which may have to be relocated,

contractor.
8. Authority and Duties of the Inspector-In-Charge.
A. As the direct representative of the engineer, the inspectorin-
charge has immediate charge of the engineering details, and is
responsible for the satisfactory completion of the project.
B. In case any dispute arises between the contractor and the
inspector-in-charge as to materials furnished or the manner of
performing the work, the inspector-in-charge shall have authority to
reject materials or suspend the work until the question at issue can
be referred to and be decided by the engineer. A rejection of
materials or suspension of work shall be confirmed by written notice
from the inspector-in-charge to the contractor.
9. Duties of the Inspector. Duly authorized inspectors, who shall
perform their duties under the direction of the engineer or his authorized
assistants, will be assigned to the project or parts thereof. The contractor
shall execute his work under the observation and subject to examination
of an inspector or inspectors, and shall carry out such work during the
approved working hours of the day, unless specifically directed otherwise,
and shall afford every facility for inspecting the materials and work at

testing, or removing portions of finished work, except as otherwise
provided. The contractor shall provide all labor and equipment
necessary for such examination.
B. Should the work thus exposed or examined prove
unsatisfactory, it shall be removed and replaced promptly by the
contractor.
C. When any unit of government or political subdivisions, or any
public or private corporation, is to pay a portion of the cost of the
work covered by the contract, its respective representatives shall
have the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no sense
make any unit of government or political subdivision, or any public or
private corporation, a party to this contract and shall in no way
- 273 -
(22, §107(10), cont'd) (22, §107(10), cont'd)
interfere with the rights of either party hereunder.
11. Defective Work and Materials. When any work and/or material does
not meet, within reasonably close conformity, the requirements of the
drawings and specifications, such work and/or material shall be declared
defective, and shall be removed and replaced, or at the option of the
engineer, may be satisfactorily corrected, by and at the expense of the
contractor.
12. Maintenace During Construction. The contractor shall maintain the
work during construction and until the project is accepted. This
maintenance shall constitute continuous and effective work prosecuted day
by day, with adequate equipment and forces to the end that the roadway or
structures are kept in satisfactory condition at all times.
13. Materaials.
A. Preliminary Approval. The source of supply of all materials
shall be approved by the engineer before delivery is started. Representative
preliminary sample of the materials, of the kind and Quality
herein described, shall be submitted, when indicated or directed, for
examination, or test, and written approval of the quality of such
samples shall be received by the contractor prior to obtaining materials
from the respective sources of supply. If it is found that
materials from previously approved sources of supply do not produce
specified products, the contractor shall furnish materials from other
approved sources.
B. Inspection.
(1) All materials shall be inspected and meet specification
requirements before being stored for use on the project.
Questionable materials, pending laboratory acceptance, shall not
be unloaded and incorporated with materials previously accepted
as meeting these specifications. When the grading and the
quality of materials delivered to the project do not conform to
the grading or quality as inspected and tested, or otherwise do
not conform to the specifications, the Borough reserves the right
to reject them at the site of the work. The contractor shall
furnish all necessary assistance to the inspection in obtaining
samples as required.
(2) The contractor shall permit any designated representative
of the engineer to inspect any and all materials being
used or desired to be used, at any time before, during, or after
its preoaration, or while being used during the progress of the
work or after the work has been completed. The contractor shall
furnish or arrange with producers or manufacturers to provide all
necessary material, labor, tools, and equipment for such
inspection.
(3) It is understood that such inspections and tests, if
made at any point other than the point of incorporation in the
work, in no way shall be considered as a guarantee of acceptance
of such material nor of continued acceptance of material presumed
to be similar to that upon which inspections and tests have been
made, and that inspections and testing performed by the State
shall not relieve the contractor or his suppliers of
- 274 -
(22, '5107(13), cont'd) (22, §107(13), cont'd)
responsibility for quality control.
14. Tests and Acceptance of Materials.
A. Materials will be accepted on the basis of inspection and
testing and/or certification as directed by the Engineer. All
material shall be approved prior to incorporation in the work.
B. All tests of samples of materials shall be made by the
engineer, unless otherwise specified at the laboratory or such other
places as maybe designated by the engineer, in accordance with methods
described in "Standard Specifications for Highway Materials and

Highway Officials, and supplements thereto; or, provided the required
method is not described therein, the tests shall be made in accordance
with "Standards and Tentatives of the American Society for Testing and
Materials," or other testing procedures adopted by the Borough.
Samples shall meet all tests as required under these specifications to
the satisfaction of the engineer.
C. When tests are made at places other than the laboratory, the
contractor or producer shall provide the necessary personnel to assist
in collecting and transporting samples to the site of the test and for
the verification of the accuracy of all scales, measures, and testing
equipment.
15. Unacceptable Materials. All materials not conforming to the
requirements of the specifications, whether in place or not, shall be
rejected. Such material(s) shall be removed promptly from the site of
work, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. No rejected material, the
defects of which have been corrected, shall be returned to the site of the
work until such time as approval for its use has been given by the
Engineer.
16. ACT 287 (1974)/ACT 172 (1986). The contractor shall comply with
the provisions of Act No. 287 (1974) and Act No. 172 (1986), of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. No construction activities in the vicinity
of underground utilities shall commence until these Acts have been complied
with.
17. Cost of Tests and Inspections. The developer shall reimburse the
Borough for all costs incurred for inspections and tests. These costs must
be reimbursed before the Borough will accept dedication of public improvements.
(Ord. 393, 4/3/1990, §107)
§108. Dedication of Public Improvements.
1. General. The offer of dedication and acceptance of public
improvmments will be in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (Act 247).
2. As Built Plan. After final plan approval and upon completion of
all required improvments, the developer shall submit an as built plan
showing the location, dimension, and elevation of all improvements. In

structures, and/or drainage systems and erosion and sediment control
practices (including vegetative measures) are in substantial conformance
- 275 -
(22, §108(2), cont'd) (22, §108(2), cont'd)
with the previously approved drawings and specifications. The plan shall
note all deviation from the previously approved drawings. One (1)
reproducible and four (4) copies of the plan shall be submitted to the
Borough.
3. Release from Improvement Bond.
A. When the developer has completed all the required
improvements, and has submitted the as built plan, he shall notify the
Borough Council in writing, by certified or registered mail, and shall
also send a copy of the letter to the Borough Engineer. The Borough
Council shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of such letter,
authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect the required improvements.
The Borough Engineer shall promptly file a report, in writing, with
the Borough Council, and shall mail a copy of the report to the
developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made
and mailed within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Borough
Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from Council. The Borough
Council shall then indicate approval or rejection of said imrovements,
either in whole or in part; and if not approved, state reasons for the
rejection. The Borough Council shall immediately notify the developer
in writing, by certified or registered mail, of its actions.
B. If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved; and the developer
shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance
guaranty bond or other security agreement.
C. If any portion of said improvements are not approved or are
rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to
complete or correct the same; and, upon completion, the same procedure
of notification outlined herein shall be followed.
D. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of
the developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Borough Council.
E. In the event any improvements which may be required have not
been installed as provided in these regulations or in accordance with
the approved final plan, the Borough Council has the power to enforce
any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other security are
insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the
Borough Council may, at its option, install part of such improvments
in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may
institute approprite legal or equitable action to recover the monies
necessary to complete the remainder of the improvments. All of the
proceeds resulting from the security of any legal or equitable action
brought against the developer shall be used solely for the
installation of the improvments covered by such security and not for
any other purpose.
4. Acceptance of Improvements. Every street, park, or other improvement
shown on a subdivision plan and which is recorded on the subdivision
plan, shall be deemed to be a private street, park, or improvement until
- 276 -
(22, §108(4), cont' d) (22, §108(4), cont' d)
such time as the same has been offered for dedication to the Borough and

1. Application of Standards.
A. The following subdivision and land development principles,
standards, and requirements shall be applied by the Planning
Commission and/or Council in evaluating plans for proposed
developments.
B. The standards and requirements outlined herein shall be
considered minimum standards and requirements for the promotion of
public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
C. Where literal compliance with the standards herein specified
is clearly impractical, the Planning Commission may recommend, and
Council may modify or adjust the standards to permit reasonable
utilization of property while securing substantial conformance with
the objectives of this Chapter.
2. General Standards.
A. Land shall be developed in conformance with the Comprehensive
Plan, Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], and other ordinances and
regulations in effect in the Borough.
B. The design of subdivisions and land developments shall
preserve, insofar as possible, the natural terrain, natural drainage,
existing topsoil, and trees.
C. Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property, such as
may arise from fire, floods, disease, or other causes, shall not be
developed for building purposes unless such hazards have been
eliminated or unless the plan shall show adequate safeguards against
them, which shall be approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
D. All portions of a tract being developed shall be taken up in
streets, public lands, or other proposed uses so that remnants of
land-locked areas shall not be created.
E. Lot lines shall, where possible, follow Borough boundary
lines rather than cross them.
F. Proposed residential, commercial, or industrial subdivisions
coordinated with existing nearby neighborhood and use patterns so that
the community as a whole may develop harmoniously, and the proposed
development shall be properly coordinated in terms of Borough and
community services and facilities.
G. The layout or arrangement of all streets in and bordering a
subdivision or land development shall be coordinated with existing
streets within the Borough.
3. Blocks.
A. All blocks in a subdivision shall have a minimum length of
five hundred (500) feet and a maximum length of sixteen hundred
- 281 -
(22, §201(3), cont'd) (22, §201(3), cont'd)
(1,600) feet. Blocks subdivided into lots shall be two (2) lot depths
in width, except lots along a major thoroughfare which front on an
interior street.
B. In commercial or residential land development areas, the
block layout shall conform, with due consideration of site conditions,
to the best possible layout to serve the public, to permit efficient
traffic circulation and the parking of cars, to make delivery and pick
up efficient, and to reinforce the best design of the units in the
commercial or residential area.
C. The block layout in industrial areas shall be governed by the
most efficient arrangement of space for present use and future
expansion, with due regard for worker and customer access and parking.
D. In large blocks with interior parks and playgrounds, in
exceptionally long blocks where access to a school or shopping center
is necessary, or where cross streets are impractical or unnecessary, a
cross-walk with a minimum right-of-way of twelve (12) feet and five
(5) feet of paving included therein may be required by Council.
E. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two (2) tiers of lots, except where reverse-frontage lots
bordering a major traffic street are used.
4. Lot and Lot Size.
A. Lot dimensions and areas shall not be less than specified by
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] and shall further
conform to the following requirement designed to abate health hazards:
(1) Where both or either water supply and sanitary sewage
disposal are provided by individual on-lot facilities, Council
may require that the subdivider provide a registered professional
engineer or a qualified sanitarian to make such tests as are
necessary to determine the adequacy of the proposed facilities in
relation to the proposed lot size and existing grade and soil
conditions. In all such cases, a certificate by the registered
professional engineer or qualified sanitarian that the proposed
facilities are adequate shall be prerequisite to final approval
of the plan.
B. Lots shall conform to the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
C. All lots shall abut on a public street, or shall have access
to an approved private street. In general, side lot lines shall be at
right angles or radial to street lines. If, after subdividing, there
exist remnants of land, they shall be included in the area of proposed
or existing lots.
D. Double frontage lots are prohibited.
E. Reverse-frontage lots are prohibited, except where employed
to prevent vehicular access to major traffic streets. Reversefrontage
lots may be required to provide separation of residential
development from major traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen
easement of at least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no
right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting
- 282 -
(22, §201(4), cont'd) (22, §201(4), cont' d)
such a traffic artery.
F. House numbers shall be assigned to each lot by the Borough
Secretary. [Ord. 427]
5. Access. Access shall be provided for all lots and portions of the
tract in the subdivision and to adjacent unsubdivided territory. Where the
proposed lots may be resubdivided, or a portion of a tract is not subdivided
into building lots, adequate provision shall be made for adequate future
access requirements. Streets giving access shall be improved to the limits
of the subdivision. Remnants, reserve strips, and land-locked areas shall
not be created.
6. Restriction of Access.
A. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or
proposed collector or arterial street, the Council may require that
access to such streets be limited by one (1) of the following means:
(1) The subdivision or lots so as to back onto the primary
arterial or collector and front onto a parallel local street; no
aceshal be provided from the primary arterial or colector
and screening approved by Council shall be provided in a strip of
land along the property line of such lots adjoining the collector
or arterial.
(2) A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short
loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such
a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial or collector.
(3) A marginal access or service road (separated from the
primary arterial or collector by a planting or grass strip and
having access thereto at suitable points).
7. Street Systems.
A. The location and width of all streets shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27], and the
official map or to such parts thereof as may have been adopted by the
Borough.
B. Proposed streets shall further conform to such County and
State highway plans as have been prepared, adopted, and/or filed as
prescribed by law.
C. Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to
produce reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage, and suitable
building sites.
D. Residential streets shall be laid out as to discourage
through traffic; however, the arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of existing or platted streets and proper access to
adjoining undeveloped tracts suitable for future development.
E. New streets shall be provided through to the boundary lines
of the development with temporary easements for turnarounds when the
subdivision or land development adjoins unsubdivided acreage; however,
no such streets are required when it is shown to the satisfaction of
Council to be poor or unnecessary design or that such a requirement
- 283 -
(22, §201(7), cont'd) (22, §201(7), cont'd)
would not further the objectives of this Chapter.
F. Streets that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street
names shall not be repeated and all street names shall be subject to
the approval of appropriate local authorities.
G. If land or lots resulting from original subdivision or land
development are large enough to permit re-subdivision or land
development, or if a portion of the tract is not developed, adequate
street rights-of-way to permit further subdivision or land development
shall be provided as necessary.
H. Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing or proposed major traffic street or arterial highway, Council
may request dedication of additional right-of-way to provide the
minimum right-of-way specified in §201(12), and marginal access
streets, rear service alleys, reverse-frontage lots, or such other
treatment as will provide protection for abutting properties,
reduction in the number of intersections with the major street, and
separation of local and through traffic.
I. New half or partial streets shall not be permitted except
where essential to reasonable development of a tract in conformance
with the other requirements and standards of this Chapter and where,
in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining
part of the street can be secured.
J. Wherever a tract to be developed borders an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be plotted within
such tract.
8. Cul-De-Sacs and Turn-Arounds.
A. Dead end streets shall be prohibited, except where designed
as temporary turn-arounds, to permit future street extension into
adjoining tracts, or when designed as cul-de-sacs.
B. All cul-de-sacs, whether permanently or temporarily designed
as such, shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet in length.

and permanent stormwater management facilities constructed as part of any of
the regulated activities listed in this Section. Stormwater management and
erosion and sedimentation control during construction activities are
specifically not regulated by this Part, but shall continue to be regulated
under Chapter 102 of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law. The following
activities are defied as "regulated activities" and shall be regulated by
this Part:
A. Land development.
B. Subdivision.
C. Construction of new or additional impervious or semipervious
surfaces (i.e. driveways, parking lots, etc.).
D. Construction of new buildings or additions to existing

activities may not proceed until the developer, or his or her agent, has
received written approval of a drainage plan from the Borough of New Holland.
The following activities shall be exempt from the requirements of this Part:
A. Any regulated activity that meets the exemption criteria in
appendix to this Part is exempt from the drainage plan preparation
provisions of this Part. This criteria shall apply to the total
development, even if development is to take place in phases. December
1, 1998, shall be the starting point from which to consider tracts as
"parent tracts" in which future subdivision and respective impervious
area computations shall be cumulatively considered. Exemptions shall
not relieve the applicant from providing adequate stormwater management
to meet the purposes of this Part.
B. Land disturbance associated with existing one and two family
dwellings subject to conditions as described in subsection (A) of this
Section.
C. Use of land for gardening for home consumption.

No exemption shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in
§202(1)(E) and (1)(F) of this Part.
3. General.
A. The management of storm water on the site, both during and upon
completion of the 'disturbances associated with the proposed subdivision
or land development, shall be accomplished in accordance with the
standards and criteria of this subsection. The design of any temporary
or permanent facilities and structures and the utilization of any
natural drainage systems shall be in full compliance with these terms
and the interpretations of the Borough. At the time of application for
a building permit for any approved lot created by a subdivision under
terms of this Chapter, issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon
adherence to the terms of this subsection.
B. In order to prevent accelerated erosion and resulting sedimentation,
land disturbance activities relating to an approved subdivision
or land development shall be conducted only in conformity with the
following principles:
(1) There shall be no increase in discharge of sediment or
other solid materials from the site as a result of storm water
runoff.
(2) Erosion and sedimentation devices such as temporary
vegetation/mulch, temporary detention basins, diversion terraces,
rock filter berms, or hay bales (in areas of minimum flows)
appropriate to the scale of the operations shall be installed
concurrent with earthmoving activities and whenever a situation is
created which would contribute to increased erosion.

(22, §202(3), cont'd) (22, §202(3), cont'd)
vegetation shall be retained and protected. Such trees shall not
be removed except as provided on the approved subdivision or land
development plan. The filling of soil over the roots of trees to
be preserved is prohibited. (The roots are presumed to extend out
from the tree as far as the tree's branches extend outward.)
(7) Land disturbance shall be limited to the actual construction
site and an access strip. The amount of disturbed area and
the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum.

other disruption by construction activity shall be established in
consultation with the engineer and such areas shall include, at
minimum, those underlain by carbonate limestone formations.
(11) Stormwater runoff from a project site shall flow
directly into a natural watercourse or into an existing storm sewer
system, or onto adjacent properties in an approved manner similar
to the runoff characteristics of the predevelopment flow, but in
any event, a concentrated discharge of stormwater may not occur
unless into a natural watercourse or easement. [Ord. 427]
(12) Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one (1)
watershed to another unless the watersheds are subwatersheds of a
common watershed which join together within the perimeter of the
property, or the effect of the transfer does not alter the peak
discharge onto adjacent lands, or drainage easements from the
affected landowners are provided. (Ord. 427]
(13) The stormwater management system shall be designed to
assure no increase in the one hundred (100) year flood elevations
or velocities. [Ord. 427]
C. All subdivision and land development activities involving an
increase in impervious cover for any watershed discharging from the
project site shall be conducted in conformance with the following
performance standards:
(1) Mill Creek Watershed.
(a) For all regulated activities within the Mill Creek
Watershed as defined by the Lancaster County Act 167 Mill
Creek Watershed Stormwater Management Plan, post-development
rate of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed
Page Revised 3/7/2000 - 293 -

Watershed, all storms up to and including a 10 year storm
shall not exceed the peak rates of runoff prior to development
from a 2 year storm. Peak rate of runoff for any storms of
greater than 10 year frequency up to an including a 100 year
storm shall not exceed the peak rates of runoff from the site
of such storms before development, including 25, 50 and 100
year storms.
(2) In establishing the conditions for calculating runoff
originating -on the site prior to development, the following
assumptions shall apply:
(a) Woodland shall be used as the prior condition for
those portions of the site having trees of greater than six
(6) inches DBH or where such trees existed within eighteen
(18) months of application.
(b) Meadow shall be used for all other areas, including
areas which are presently covered by impervious surfaces.
(c) Average antecedent moisture conditions.
(d) A Type II distribution storm.

7.2
If the Rational Method is used, the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Rainfall Intensity - Duration - Frequency Chart shown in the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Design Manual, Part 2,
August 1981, shall be used to determine the rainfall intensity in
inches per hour.
(5) Time of concentration for runoff calculations shall be

to the plan content requirements of Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources' Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Manual.
D. Storm sewers, culverts, bridges, and related installations
shall be provided:
(1) To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses. Such
flow may be redirected as required, subject to the approval of the
Department of Environmental Resources.
(2) To insure adequate drainage of all low points along the
line of streets.
(3) To intercept storm water runoff along streets at
intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area
drained, and to prevent substantial flow of water across intersections
or flooded intersections.
Page Revised 3/7/2000 - 295 -
(22, §202(3), cont'd) (22, §202(3), cont'd)

4. Design Standards; Water Carrying Facilities.
A. All storm sewer pipes, culverts .and bridges (excluding
detention and retention basin outfall structures) conveying water
originating only from within the boundaries of the project site shall
be designed for a twenty-five (25) year storm event. All storm sewer
pipes, culverts and bridges (excluding detention and retention basin
outfall structures) conveying water originating from off-site shall be
designed for a fifty (50) year storm event. Drainage easements shall
be provided to contain and convey the one hundred (100) year frequency
flood throughout the project site. Easements shall begin at the furthest
upstream property line of the proposed development in a watershed.
B. Where, in the judgment of the Borough, the quantity of storm
water runoff will cause detrimental downstream impact, quantity will be
a consideration in the method of storm water management.
C. Storm sewers, as required, shall be placed immediately in front
of the curb, when parallel to the street within the right-of-way. When
located in undedicated land, they shall be placed within an easement not
less than twenty (20) feet wide as approved by the Borough. Open
ditches per se shall be avoided but properly designed, graded, and
turfed drainage swales shall be permitted in lieu of storm sewers in
commercial and industrial areas and, where approved by the Borough, in
residential areas. Such swales shall be designed not only to carry the
required discharge without erosion but also to increase the time of
required discharge without erosion but also to increase the time of
concentration, reduce the peak discharge and velocity, and permit the
water to percolate into the soil.
D. Storm sewer pipes and culverts shall be installed on sufficient
slopes to provide a minimum velocity of three (3) feet per second when
flowing full.
E. All storm sewer pipe and culverts shall be laid to a minimum

feet length.
K. The standard rolled cub shall continue unchanged across the
entrance to any driveway.
L. Standard slant curb shall be permitted by permission of
Borough Council in lieu of standard straight curb, or standard rolled
curb, provided, however, that no such installation shall be permitted
unless all curb on both sides of the complete block will be of slant
curb construction. Slant curbing shall be constructed to dimensions and
specifications as set forth in the Appendix attached hereto and made a
part hereof. Except as set forth in the Appendix attached hereto,
standard slant curb shall be constructed in accordance with the
provisions of subsections .1.I, .J, and .K. [Ord. 482]
2. Sidewalks.
A. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of new streets in

(Ord. 393, 4/3/1990, §205; as amended by Ord. 427, 12/28/1993; and by Ord.
482, 11/6/2001, §1)
§206. Driveways.
1. General.
A. Access driveways onto Borough highways or highways which are
to be dedicated to the Borough shall conform to the requirements of this
Section. A building permit shall be obtained from the Borough before
construction commences.
B. Access driveways onto highways controlled by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation shall comply with Department regulations.
A highway occupancy permit should be obtained prior to issuance of any
building permits and a copy should be presented to the Borough.
2. General Driveway Requirements.
A. All driveways shall be located, designed, constructed and
maintained in such a manner as not to interfere or be inconsistent with
the design, maintenance and drainage of the highway.
B. General Location Restrictions. Access driveways will be
permitted at locations in which:
(1) Sight distance is adequate to safely allow each permitted
movement to be made into or out of the access driveway.
(2) The free movement of normal highway traffic is not
impaired.
(3) The driveway will not create a hazard.
(4) The driveway will not create an area of undue traffic
congestion on the highway.
C. Specific Location Restrictions.
(1) Access driveways shall not be located at interchanges,
ramp areas, or locations that would interfere with the placement
Page Revised 7/1/2014 - 307 -
(22, §206(2), cont’d) (22, §206(2), cont’d)
and proper functioning of highway signs, signals, detectors,
lighting or other devices that affect traffic control.
(2) The location of a driveway near a signalized intersection
may include a requirement that the permittee provide, in cooperation
with the Borough, new or relocated detectors, signal heads,
controller, and the like, for the control of traffic movements from
the driveway.
(3) Access to a property which abuts two (2) or more
intersecting streets or highways may be restricted to only that
roadway which can more safely accommodate its traffic.
(4) The Borough may require the permittee to locate an access
driveway directly across from a highway, local road or access
driveway on the opposite side of the roadway if it is judged that
offset driveways will not permit left turns to be made safely or
that access across the roadway from one (1) access to the other
will create a safety hazard.
D. Number of Driveways. The number and locations of entrances
which may be granted will be based on usage, interior and exterior
traffic patterns and current design policy of the Borough.
(1) Normally, only one (1) driveway will be permitted for a
residential property and not more than two (2) driveways will be
permitted for a non-residential property.
(2) If the property frontage exceeds six hundred (600) feet,
the permit may authorize an additional driveway.
(3) Regardless of frontage, a development may be restricted
to a single entrance/exit driveway, served by an internal collector
road separated from the traveled way.
E. Approaches to Driveways. Driveway approaches shall conform
to the following standards:
(1) The location and angle of an access driveway approach in
relation to the highway intersection shall be such that a vehicle
entering or leaving the driveway may do so in an orderly and safe
manner and with a minimum of interference to highway traffic.
(2) Where the access driveway approach and highway pavement
meet, flaring of the approach may be necessary to allow safe, easy
turning of vehicular traffic.
(3) Where the highway is curbed, driveway approaches shall
be installed one and one-half (1/2) inches above the adjacent
highway or gutter grade to maintain proper drainage. See Figure
5, Appendix V.
F. Future Additional Driveways.
(1) If the Borough anticipates that a property may be
subdivided and that such subdivision will result in an unacceptable
number or arrangement of driveways or both, the Borough may require
the property owner to enter into an access covenant prior to
issuance of a permit.
- 308 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(22, §206(2), cont’d) (22, §206(2), cont’d)
(2) The access covenant will restrict access to the approved
locations regardless of whether the land is later subdivided or
conveyed to other persons, or both.
(3) The access covenant shall become a part of the permit,
which shall be recorded in the County Office of the Recorder of
Deeds.
G. Use of Highway Prohibited.
[Text continued on p. 309]
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 308.1 -
- 308.2 -
(22, §206(2), cont'd) (22, §206(2), cont'd)
(1) No part of the right-of-way shall be used for servicing
vehioles, displays or conducting business. The area between the
edge of the pavement and the right-of-way line shall be kept
clear of all buildings, sales exhibits, business signs, vehicles,
service equipment and similar items.
(2) Improvements on private property adjacent to the
right-of-way shall be so located that parking, stopping and
maneuvering of vehicles on the right-of-way will not be necessary
in order for vehicles or patrons to be served. New liquid fuel
pump islands installed in service stations adjacent to the
highway shall be located at least twelve (12) feet outside the
right-of-way, in order for a driveway permit to be issued. See
Figure 11 and Figure 12, Appendix 5.
3. Driveway Design Requirements.
A. General.
(1) The ability of a driveway to safely and efficiently
function as an integral component of a highway system requires
that its design and construction be based on the amount and type
of traffic that it is expected to serve and the type and
character of roadway which it accesses. This Section separates
driveways into four (4) classifications, based on the amount of
traffic they are expected to serve. A description of each
classification and typical examples of land uses normally
associated with each follows:
(a) Minimum use driveway, see Figure 7, Appendix V. A
driveway normally used by not more than twenty-five (25)
vehicles per day such as:
1) Single family dwellings, duplex houses; or,
2) Apartments with five (5) units or less.
(b) Low volume driveway, see Figure 8, Appendix V. A
driveway normally used by more than twenty-five (25)
vehicles per day but less than seven hundred fifty (750)
vehicles per day, such as:
1) Office buildings;
2) Elementary and junior high schools; or,
3) Car washes.
(c) Medium volume driveway, see Figures 9, 11, 12,
Appendix V. A driveway normally used by more than seven
hundred fifty (750) vehicles but less than one thousand five
hundred (1,500) vehicles a day, which does not normally
require traffic signalization, such as:
1) Motels;
2) Fast food restaurants; or,
3) Service stations and small shopping centers or
plazas.
(d) High volume driveway, see Figure 10, Appendix V.
- 309 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
A driveway normally used by more than one thousand five
hundred (1,500) vehicles per day, which often requires
traffic signalization, such as:
1) Large shopping centers; or
2) Multi-building apartments or office complexes.
(2) The design features described in this Section and
illustrated in the attendant figures are to be used by the
applicant in designing the driveway plans which accompany the
application. Dimensions shall be selected from the range of
values shown on the appropriate figure, unless site conditions
warrant a deviation. The Borough may require design details
which are more stringent than those specified in this Section to
insure the safe and efficient operation of any proposed driveway.
(3) Figures 7, 8 and 9, Appendix V, show two (2) sets of
design values. The applicant shall design his driveway using the
values appropriate for the posted speed of the roadway being
accessed.
B. Angle of Access Driveway Approach.
(1) Access driveway approaches used for two (2) way
operation shall be positioned at right angles, that is, ninety
(90) degrees, to the highway or as near thereto as site
conditions permit, except as authorized in Figure 11, Appendix V.
(2) When two (2) access driveways are constructed on the
same property frontage and used for one (1) way operation, each
of these driveways may be placed at an angle less than a right
angle, but not less than forty-five (45) degrees to the highway,
except that along divided highways where no openings are allowed
in the median, the minimum angle of an exit driveway may be
thirty (30) degrees, as shown in Figure 12, Appendix V. Signs
which designate the appropriate one-way travel designation shall
be provided. [Ord. 427]
C. Driveways Adjacent to Intersections. Driveways serving
properties located adjacent to a highway intersection are subject to
the following:
(1) There shall be a minimum ten (10) foot tangent distance
between intersecting highway radius and the radius of the first
permitted driveway.
(2) The distance from the edge of pavement of the
intersecting highway to the radius of the first permitted
driveway shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet on curbed
highways and thirty (30) feet on uncurbed highways.
(3) Paragraphs A and B of this subsection may be waived
only if the intersecting highway radius extends along the
property frontage to the extent that compliance is physically
impossible.
D. Property Line Clearance. Except for joint-use driveways, no
portion of any access shall be located outside of the property
frontage boundary line.
- 310 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
E. Multiple Driveways. Multiple driveways serving the same
property must be separated by a minimum distance of fifteen (15) feet
measured along the right-of-way line and twenty (20) feet measured
along the shoulder, ditch line or curb. When the distance between
multiple driveways is fifty (50) feet or less measured along the
shoulder or ditch line, the area between shall be clearly defined by
permanent curbing. This curb shall be placed in line with existing
curb or two (2) feet back of the shoulder or ditch line on uncurbed
highways. It shall be extended around the driveway radii to the
right-of-way line.
F. Site Requirements.
(1) All nonresidential buildings shall be located a
sufficient distance from the right-of-way line to provide ample
driving area and parking off the right-of-way to prevent storage
of vehicles on the access driveways and to prevent the backup and
turning of vehicles on the highway pavement.
(2) The radii of internal curves shall be as large as
possible to allow a direct movement from the highway into a
proper position to obtain service or parking without any
interference to other vehicles attempting the same maneuver.
(3) Applications for driveways providing access to
drive-in-service developments shall, when requested, include
information relative to the amount of storage provided between
the service facility and the right-of-way, the number of service
operations anticipated during peak periods and the hours and days
of operation.
(4) The area between the right-of-way line adjacent to and
on both sides of a driveway shall be used as a clear zone to
provide a physical barrier between the traveled way and activity
on private property. This area shall remain free of any
obstructions which may interfere with a clear line of visions for
entering or exiting vehicles.
G. Curbing.
(1) The permit may require the installation of curbing
wherever it is required to control access or drainage, or both.
All curbing must be permanent curbing.
(2) Where property abutting the right-of-way line could be
used as a parking area, the permit may require curbing, permanent
guard rail or fencing to be constructed along the right-of-way
line in order to prohibit vehicle encroachment upon the sidewalk
or shoulder area.
(3) If, in the opinion of the Borough, there is a high
probability that vehicles would otherwise utilize a portion of
the property frontage other than the approved driveway to gain
access to the property, the permit may require curbing or other
physical barriers to be constructed.
(4) When curb exists adjacent to the proposed driveway, the
line and grade of the existing curb shall be matched, unless
otherwise authorized by the permit.
- 311 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
H. Sight Distance.
(1) Access driveways shall be located at a point within the
property frontage limits which provides at least the minimum
sight distance listed in the appropriate following table:

- 313 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
(2) In using Tables 1 through 6, the following additional
requirements shall apply;
(a) Tables 2, 4 and 6 shall be used in lieu of Tables
1 and 5 only when combination traffic exceeds five (5%)
percent of the total traffic using the proposed driveway.
(b) Posted speeds shall be used unless operating
speeds vary from the posted speed by more than ten (10)
miles per hour, in which case, the Borough may require that
operating speeds be used.
(c) The sight distances in Tables 1 through 4 apply
only when highway grades are zero to three (3%) percent,
either up or down.
1) When the highway grade in the section to be
used for acceleration, after leaving the driveway,
ascends at three (3%) to five (5%) percent, the sight
distance in the direction of approaching ascending
traffic may be increased by a factor of 1.4.
2) When the highway grade ascends at greater than
five (5%) percent, sight distance may be increased by a
factor of 1.7.
3) When the highway grade in the section to be
used for acceleration after leaving the driveway
descends at three (3%) to five (5%) percent, sight
distance in the direction of approaching descending
highway traffic may be reduced by a factor of 0.6.
4) When the road descends at greater than five
(5%) percent, sight distance may be reduced by a factor
of 0.5.
(d) The sight distance values in Table 1 through 6 are
desirable for safe operation of the driveway. Sight
distance values less than desirable will be accepted only if
it is impossible to achieve the desirable value by locating
the driveway at any point within the property frontage
boundaries. The minimum acceptable sight distance values
shall be computed from the following formula:
SSSD = 1.47 Vt + V2
30 (f±g)
SSSD = Minimum safe stopping sight distance (feet).
v = Velocity of vehicle (miles per hour).
t = Perception time of motorist (average = 2.5
seconds).
f = Wet friction of pavement (average - 0.30).
g = Percent grade of roadway divided by 100.
(3) If sight distance requirements as specified in this
Section cannot be met, the Borough may:
- 314 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
(a) Prohibit left turns by exiting vehicles;
(b) Restrict turning movements to right turns in and
out of a driveway;
(c) Require installation of a right turn acceleration
lane or deceleration lane;
(d) Require installation of a separate left turn
standby lane;
(e) Alter the horizontal or vertical geometry of the
roadway; or,
(f) Deny access to the highway.
I. Grades of Access Driveway.
(1) All driveways shall be constructed so as not to impair
drainage within the right-of-way, alter the stability of the
improved area or change the drainage of adjacent areas.
(2) Where a drainage ditch or swale exists, the permittee
shall install adequate pipe under the driveway in accordance with
§202. Drainage pipe installed under driveways shall be at least
fifteen (15) inches in diameter.
(3) The side slopes for driveway embankments within the
right-of-way shall not be steeper than ten to one (10 to 1). See
Figure 6, Appendix V.
(4) Grade requirements in uncurbed shoulders within the
right-of-way shall conform to Figure 1, Appendix V.
(5) Grade requirements where curbs and sidewalks are
present.
(a) The driveway approaohes shall be installed one and
one-half (1 1/2) inch above the adjacent roadway or the
gutter grade to maintain proper drainage. See Figure 5,
Appendix V.
(b) The difference between the cross slope of the
roadway and the upward grade of the driveway approach shall
not exceed eight (8%) percent.
(c) When a planted area exists in front of the
sidewalk, one (1) of the following three (3) cases shall
apply;
1) When the grass strip between the curb and the
sidewalk is wide enough to maintain an eight (8%)
percent maximum driveway approach grade, construct the
driveway as shown on Figure 2, Appendix V.
2) If the driveway grade would exceed eight (8%)
percent, depress the outer edge of the sidewalk and
maintain a maximum sidewalk cross slope of six (6%)
percent. This will enable the driveway slope to stay
within the eight (8%) percent slope limit. See Figure
3, Appendix V.
- 315 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
3) If the sidewalk cross slope would exceed six
(6%) percent, as indioated in subsection (2) of this
subsection, depress the entire sidewalk. The amount of
depression shall not exceed one and one-half (1 1/2)
inches at the inner edge of the sidewalk. The
longitudinal slope of the sidewalk shall not exceed two
(2) inches per foot. See Figure 3, Appendix V.
(d) When the sidewalk is directly against the back of
the curb and the sidewalk is at least five (5) feet wide,
the curb shall be sloped as shown in Figure 5 of Appendix V.
This will eliminate the need for depressing the back edge of
the sidewalk. For sidewalks narrower than five (5) feet,
the curb will be sloped and the back edge of the sidewalk
will be depressed (maximum one and one-half (1 1/2) inch) to
maintain an eight (8%) percent maximum grade on the
driveway. The longitudinal grade of the sidewalk shall not
exceed two (2) inches per foot.
J. Auxiliary Lanes.
(1) Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes. The combination
of highway speed, volumes, location and arrangement of driveways
and intersections may require the installation of an acceleration
or deceleration lane, or both, to serve a proposed low, medium or
high volume driveway. When required by the permit, a speed
change lane of sufficient length and width shall be constructed
to allow vehicles to safely decelerate or accelerate when
entering or leaving the property.
(2) Left Turn Standby Lanes. The permit may require the
installation of a left turn standby lane to separate and protect
left turning vehicles from through traffic if failure to do sc
would result in an undue hazard to the traveling public.
(3) Where the width of the highway right-of-way is
insufficient to permit the construction of a needed auxiliary
lane, the permittee shall provide any necessary additional
right-of-way.
(4) When required, auxiliary lanes shall be constructed, at
no cost to the Borough, in accordance with the roadway
construction standards.
(5) If an auxiliary lane must be located in front of
another person's property, the applicant shall be required to
secure the approval of the other person or indemnify the Borough
against any action which the other person may bring against the
Borough.
K. Access Driveway Pavement. Minimum use driveways shall he
constructed with a minimum of six (6) inches of stone base and two (2)
inches of bituminous concrete between the traveled way and the
right-of-way line. Low, medium and high volume driveways shall be
constructed with a minimum if eight (8) inches of stone base and two
and one-half (2) inches of bituminous concrete.
L. Driveways Relative to Ramps. Ramps are intended to provide
- 316 -
(22, §206(3), cont'd) (22, §206(3), cont'd)
access from one (1) roadway or roadway system to another with a
minimum amount of conflict or interferenoe from other traffic. To
insure the integrity of this intended function, no access driveway
will be permitted on a ramp or within fifty (50) feet of the
intersection of the edge of pavement of the ramp or its speed change
lane with the edge of pavement of the intersection roadway.
Exceptions will be considered only if the enforcement of this
subsection will result in the prohibition of reasonable access from
adjacent property to the highway system.
M. Median Openings.
(1) The removal of a portion of a median divisor along a
divided highway to provide access to and from traffic in both
directions will not be permitted unless it is determined that the
operating characteristics of the highway system will be improved
by such action.
(2) A left turn standby lane shall be installed to separate
and protect left turning vehicles whenever a median opening is
permitted.
N. Shoulder Upgrading. Where the existing shoulder on either
side of a proposed low medium or high volume driveway is not adequate
to allow its use by turning vehicles, the permittee shall upgrade the
shoulder area for a minimum of one hundred (100) feet on either side
of the driveway. The type of shoulder to be installed will he
specified by the permit, in accordance with the volume and type of
traffic expected to use the driveway.
0. Traffic Control Devices.
(1) Nonelectrically Powered Devices. The permittee shall,
at its own expense, install and maintain all nonelectrically
powered traffic control devices, as specified in the permit,
which are required to provide for the safe and orderly movement
of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or both. These devices shall
include, but not be limited to, any required regulatory, warning
or guide signs, delineators and pavement markings.
(2) Electrically Powerd Devices.
(a) When power operated devices, including traffic
signals, are required for proper traffic control, a traffic
signal permit shall be obtained in addition to the occupancy
permit. The permit to own and operate a traffic control
device shall be requested by the Borough and will be issued
to the Borough by the Department of Transportation.
(b) Applications for driveways which include traffic
signal control shall be accompanied by the following

furnishing of all equipment, materials, labor and all else necessary to
complete all excavation, embankment, subgrade and grading for the
construction of improvements. In addition to these specifications, Form
408 specifications of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Transportation, shall apply.
2. Excavation.
A. General. Excavation shall include all excavation, as
hereinafter limited and defined, and the satisfactory use of all
suitable excavated materials, which may be necessary for the
construction and preparation of the roadway, embankments, subgrade,
shoulders, intersecting roads or streets, driveways, approaches,
ditches, structures, stream channels, railroad roadbeds, the
stabilization of slopes or base areas, required backfilling, and other
incidental construction or related work.
B. Excavation.
(1) Excavation shall include the satisfactory disposal of
all unsuitable and surplus materials, the removal, storing, and
rehandling of suitable excavation, as required, for the placement
of suitable material below subgrade elevation; and the removal,
storing, and rehandling, as necessary, of existing bituminous and
base course materials and its placement as a surface layer on
shoulder, approach, and driveway areas, as directed; also, the
furnishing, placing, and/or removal of any bracing and shoring,
including bailing and/or pumping of water, incidental to the
work, as herein described.
(2) It shall include other excavation and work incidental
thereto.
(3) During construction, the roadway shall be kept shaped
and drained at all times.
C. Removal of Existing Bases and Pavements.
(1) Where the existing rigid base course or pavement does
not require removal, it may be broken in place as directed and
shall not be removed.
(2) Where the surface of an existing non-rigid road
conforms approximately to the proposed subgrade elevation, or
where an embankment is to be made over the old road, the surface
of the former road shall be scarified uniformly to a depth of not
less than four (4) inches so as to permit satisfactory reshaping,
binding, and compaction of the subgrade or binding of the initial
layer of embankment.
(3) No concrete base course or pavement shall be broken by
the weight-dropping method where this operation may damage a
public or private facility or inconvenience or jeopardize the
- 321 -
(22, §301(2), cont'd) (22, §301(2), cont'd)
safety of the public.
(4) Where the existing rigid base course or pavement is
required to be removed, it shall be broken and utilized in
embankments as random material.
D. Slopes.
(1) Slopes shall be trimmed neatly to the lines and rate of
slope indicated on the original or revised drawings and/or
cross-sections, or as established by the engineer, and the work
left in a neat and acceptable condition.
(2) However, the slopes in cuts may be varied during
construction by the engineer, according to the type of material
encountered, in order to obtain satisfactory stability. The
excavated material shall be removed by a method which will permit
the revised slope lines to be neatly and acceptably trimmed to
meet the existing conditions.
(3) It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to
remove slide material and to bench and flatten slopes as may be
necessary to obtain the planned width of roadway and stability of
slopes at any locations directed by the engineer.
E. Excavation Beyond Established Slope Lines. The contractor
shall determine the widths and depths to be excavated in accordance
with the drawings and cross-sections. In no case shall the contractor
remove or excavate any material beyond the original or revised slope
lines as indicated on the drawings and/or cross-sections without the
written approval of the engineer.
F. Stream Channels.
(1) Excavation of stream channels, with or without
sub-ohannels, shall not be performed until directed. When
excavation of a channel having a designed bottom width of eight
(8) feet or more is completed in accordance with the drawings or
as required, and upon written request of the contractor, the
engineer will make an inspection of the excavation and when it is
found to be satisfactory, the engineer shall cause it to be
cross-sectioned and such measurements shall be used as the basis
for current and final payments of the excavation involved.
(2) The contractor shall perform all stream channel
excavation in an orderly and systematic manner to prevent,
control, and abate water pollution.
G. Topsoil.
(1) All topsoil removed from the excavation or embankment
areas will be classified as unsuitable material, unless otherwise
directed.
(2) However, approved topsoil shall be stockpiled as
required herein.
(3) When topsoil for designated area is shown on the
drawings, the contractor shall stockpile all approved topsoil
from the excavation. After this supply is exhausted, any
- 322 -
(22, §301(2), cont'd) (22, §301(2), cont'd)
additional topsoil required to complete the work will be
furnished.
H. Backfilling Around Structures. Concrete or masonry walls,
extending above the elevation of the finished roadway or its
appurtenances, shall be removed as required. Spaces excavated for,
but not occupied by, structures shall be backfilled.
3. Embankment.
A. General. This work shall consist of the construction of
embankment in accordance with these specifications and within
reasonably close conformity to the lines and grades shown on the
drawings and cross-sections or otherwise established by the engineer.
B. Materials. Material for embankment construction shall
consist of all excavation on the project except such material as may
be determined to be unsuitable by these specifications and, when
required, will include approved common borrow excavation, foreign
borrow excavation, and selected borrow excavation.
(1) Classification. For purposes of construction control,
the excavation and borrow excavation used in this construction is
further classified as follows:
(a) Soil. Soil shall include all earth materials
having a maximum size that can be readily placed and
compacted in loose eight (8) inch layers and of which more
than thirty-five (35) percent shall pass the No. 200 sieve.
Soil shall have a minimum dry weight density of ninety-five
(95) pounds per cubic foot as determined in accordance with
PTM No. 106, Method B, and a maximum liquid limit of
sixty-five (65) as determined in accordance with ASSHTO
Designation T 89. The plasticity index, as determined by
ASSHTO Designation T 90 for soils having liquid limits of
forty-one to sixty-five (41 to 65) inclusive, shall be not
less than that determined by the formula - Liquid Limit
minus thirty (30).
(b) Granular Material. Granular material shall
include all natural or synthetic mineral aggregates having a
maximum size that can be readily placed and compacted in
loose eight (8) inch layers and of which thirty-five (35%)
percent or less shall pass the No. 200 sieve.
(c) Shale. Shall shall include all rock-like minerals
formed by the natural consolidation of mud, clay, silt, and
fine sand and usually thinly laminated, comparatively soft
and easily split, having a maximum size that can be readily
placed and compacted in loose eight (8) inch layers.
(d) Rock. Rock shall include all igneous,
metamorphic, and sedimentary rock which cannot be excavated
without blasting or the use of rippers, and all boulders and
detached stones having a maximum size that cannot be readily
placed and compacted in loose eight (8) inch layers and
which generally have insufficient fines to normally fill all
the voids in each layer.
- 323 -
(22, §301(3), cont'd) (22, §301(3), cont'd)
(e) Random Material. Random material shall include
any combination of the above classifications and may include
old concrete, brick, etc., from demolition having a maximum
size that can be readily placed and compacted in loose eight
(8) inch layers and which have been approved by the
engineer.
C. Suitability of Material.
(1) Suitable Material. All material from excavation and/or
borrow excavation shall meet the requirements of subsection (B).
It shall be reasonably free of organic material, coal or coal
blossom, and any other objectionable material considered
unsuitable by the engineer for use in embankment construction.
(2) Frozen Material. Frozen material shall not be placed
in embankments and, embankment material shall not be placed on
material frozen to a depth of three (3) inches or more. If
during construction the top of the embankment freezes to a depth
of three (3) inches or more, the frozen material shall be removed
before additional material is placed.
(3) Wet Material. Material containing moisture in excess
of that percentage which will ensure satisfactory compaction
shall not be placed in the embankment, and embankment material
shall not be placed on material that has become unstable due to
excessive moisture.
(4) Dry Material. Material containing insufficient
moisture to obtain satisfactory compaction shall be moistened
before compaction.
(5) Waste Material.
(a) Material from all classes of excavation which is
unsuitable and any surplus of material not required in the
construction of embankments, shoulders and approaches, or
the widening of the roadway or the embankment slopes will be
considered waste and shall, unless otherwise directed by the
engineer, be disposed of by the contractor beyond the limits
of the project.
(b) Suitable materials, including wet or frozen
materials which would be suitable when dried or when thawed
and dried, may be wasted by the Contractor for his
convenience only with the written permission of the
engineer, and subject to replacement in equivalent volume,
at the expense of the contractor.
(c) In no case shall waste material be disposed of in
the flood channel area of any stream.
D. Preparation of Foundation Area.
(1) The embankment foundation area shall be cleared and
grubbed in accordance with §201.
(2) Existing depressions in embankment areas such as dikes,
gullies, old stream channels, stump holes, or undercut sections,
etc., shall be backfilled to the adjacent ground elevation in
- 324 -
(22, §301(3), cont'd) (22, §301(3), cont'd)
the same manner as hereinafter specified for the formation of
embankment prior to the initial layer of embankment.
(3) Embankment foundation areas, where undercutting is not
directed, shall be plowed or scarified to a depth of at least
eight (8) inches and then compacted to the density requirements
herein specified. However, in inundated swamp, and other areas
containing excessive moisture, or where field conditions warrant,
the engineer may waive this requirement.
(4) Where the embankment foundation is situated in water or
swamp areas or is saturated and/or unstable, the embankment shall
be constructed with granular or random material or rock. In such
areas, not less than high water level. Where rock embankment is
to be constructed on saturated and/or unstable areas, a filter
layer of granular material shall be placed at least three (3)
feet in depth before constructing the rock embankment.
(5) Where embankment is to be constructed on a slope, the
slope shall be benched to the width and depth shown on the
drawings or as directed.
(6) The contractor will be permitted to construct, in
layers, embankments having a maximum surface slope of ten to one
(10 to 1) where required for the installation of transverse
drainage and in the immediate vicinity thereof, as indicated on
the standard drawings.
E. Placement and Compaction.
(1) Layers.
(a) All embankment material, other than rock and
material for wet areas shall, unless otherwise directed by
the engineer, be placed in uniform horizontal layers of not
more than a loose eight (8) inch depth for the full width of
the cross section. Material placed in wet areas may be
end-dumped in water or to the elevation necessary to
establish a satisfactory working platform.
(b) Each layer for its full width shall be compacted
to not less than ninety-seven (97%) percent of the
determined dry weight density, except that the material in
the top three (3) feet of all embankments shall be compacted
to not less than one hundred (100%) percent of the
determined dry weight density. The dry weight density per
cubic foot for the material being placed will be determined
in the field in accordance with PTM No. 106, Method B. The
in place density or compaction will be determined in
accordance with PTM No. 112 or by the Department's nuclear
method. When the material is too coarse to satisfactorily
use these methods, compaction will be determined by the
engineer based on non-movement of the material under the
compaction equipment.
(c) Shale and random material containing an excessive
quantity of large fragments shall be so placed that the
coarser material is in the outside portions and the finer
- 325 -
(22, §301(3), cont'd) (22, §301(3), cont'd)
material is in the central portions of the embankment
effecting as nearly as possible a gradual transition in
size. The large pieces shall then be broken down by the use
of approved equipment until practically all voids are
filled. Mixtures of shale and rock shall be placed in
accordance with the requirements for placing shale.
(2) When a previously constructed embankment requires
additional material to bring it to required elevation, the top of
the embankment shall be thoroughly scarified before the required
additional material is placed.
(3) Embankment material placed in areas inaccessible to the
compaction equipment shall be placed in uniform loose layers not
exceeding four (4) inches in depth and compacted by means of
approved mechanical tampers to the density requirements herein
specified.
(4) Embankment in areas back of bridge abutments and
adjacent to structures under embankments shall be constructed
with selected borrow excavation as shown on the standard
drawings, unless otherwise specified. Rock may be used, provided
it is placed and compacted in layers of twelve (12) inches or
less.
(5) Rock.
(a) Rock shall not be placed in embankments before the
contractor has discussed his plans with and obtained the
approval of the engineer for the related excavation and
embankment operations.
(b) Rock shall, in general, be placed to form the base
of embankments for the full width of the cross-section.
Rock shall also be placed on side slopes where required on
the drawings, indicated on the cross-sections, or where
directed. Excess rock disposed of on the side slopes of
completed embankments need not be compacted when approved by
the engineer.
(c) Rock shall be placed in uniform loose layers not
exceeding in depth the approximate average size of the
larger rock, but limited to a maximum depth of thirty-six
(36) inches. Oversize rock shall be reduced in size until
it can be readily incorporated in a thirty-six (36) inch
layer. However, rock shall not be dumped in final position,
but shall be distributed by blading or dozing in a manner
that will ensure proper placement in the embankment so that
voids, pockets, and bridging will be reduced to a minimum.
The top layers of all rock embankments shall be limited to a
maximum depth of twelve (12) inches with all voids filled
with smaller pieces, spals, or granular material.
(d) Before rock is placed on compacted embankment
constructed of other material, the top of the embankment
shall be sloped from the centerline to the sides at the rate
of approximately one (1) inch to the foot and the top of the
embankment shall be thoroughly compacted. In no case shall
- 326 -
(22, §301(3), cont'd) (22, §301(3), cont'd)
an embankment be benched for the placement of rock
embankment or rock slopes.
(e) When rock and other embankment material are
excavated at the same time, the rock shall be placed in the
outside portion of the embankment and the other material
shall be placed in the central portion of the embankment.
During this construction, the elevations of both portions
shall be substantially the same; but, the elevation of the
layers of other material shall at all times be sufficiently
above the rock layers to allow for satisfactory compaction
of the layers of other material.
(f) All rock embankment shall be placed with care so
that the larger pieces are well distributed and the voids
filled to the extent that is practicable and so that rock
placed on side slopes will within reasonably close
conformity meet the lines shown on the drawings and
cross-sections.
(g) Rock embankment shall not be placed in localized
areas where bearing piles are to driven.
(6) During construction, the top layer of compacted
embankment shall be kept shaped and drained at all times.
F. Slopes. Slopes shall be neatly trimmed to the lines shown on
the drawings or as directed, and the finished work shall be left in a
neat and acceptable condition.
G. Stability. The contractor shall be responsible for the
stability of all embankments and shall replace all sections which, in
the judgment of the engineer, have been damaged or displaced due to
carelessness or negligence on the part of the contractor, to natural
causes such as storms, floods, etc., shrinkage of embankment
materials, and all reasons not attributable to unavoidable movement of
the natural ground upon which the embankments is placed. Where
unsuitable material has been placed in the embankment by the
contractor, its removal and replacement with suitable material shall
be at no expense to the Borough.
4. Subgrade.
A. General. This work shall consist of the preparation of the
top surface of the roadbed to accommodate the placement of the
pavement structure and shoulders or gutters in accordance with these
specifications and within reasonably close conformity to the lines,
grades, and widths shown on the drawings and cross-sections or
otherwise directed.
B. Construction Requirements.
(1) General. The graded roadbed shall be formed to the
established subgrade elevation and cross-section and compacted to
the density requirements herein specified.
(2) Density Requirements.
(a) Subgrade shall be compacted to not less than one
hundred (100%) percent of the determination dry weight
- 327 -
(22, §301(4), cont'd) (22, §301(4), cont'd)
density. The dry weight density per cubic foot for the
material in place will be determined in the field in
accordance with PTM No. 106, Method B. The in-place density
or compaction will be determined in accordance with PTM No.
112 or by the Department's nuclear method. When the
material is too coarse to satisfactorily use these methods,
compaction will be determined by the engineer based on
non-movement of the material under the specified compaction
equipment.
(b) The moisture content of subgrade material at the
time of compaction shall be not more than two (2%)
percentage points above the optium moisture content, except
that any subgrade which displays pronounced elasticity or
deformation under construction equipment shall not have a
moisture content greater than the optimum at the time
compaction or at the time of placing the overlaying
construction. When the specified stability cannot be
obtained, the material in the area shall be excavated to a
depth that when replaced and recompacted at a moisture
content not exceeding optimum, the subgrade will have the
required stability. Unsatisfactory material so remove from
excavated areas will be classified as Class I excavation; in
embankment areas, the material shall be removed at no
expense to the Borough.
(3) Subgrade Requirements.
(a) In one (1) lane and two (2) lane width
construction, the subgrade shall be completed as specified
for not less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) linear
feet, and progressively maintained, in advance of the
succeeding operation. In intersection, approach, irregular,
or isolated areas, the engineer may relax this requirement.
(b) It shall be the responsibility of the contractor
to protect and maintain the subgrade at all times. In no
case shall vehicles be permitted to travel over the subgrade
in a single track. The contractor shall promptly and
satisfactorily reshape and recompact or remove and replace
any unsatisfactory areas prior to the placement of subbase,
base course, or pavement.
(c) The subgrade shall be checked for crown and
contour in the same manner as specified for checking the
finished surface of base courses. However, where subgrade
is constructed using an approved grading machine, which cuts
the subgrade to the specified line and grade and is
controlled automatically by taut lines erected on each side
of the roadway, the templates for checking crown and contour
will not be required.

1. Scope.
- 328 -
(22, §302(1), cont'd) (22, §302(1), cont'd)
A. The work covered by this Section shall include the furnishing
of all equipment, materials, labor and all else necessary to complete
all excavation, filling, backfilling, and grading for the construction
of the improvements which shall include clearing and/or grubbing in
the area of all natural obstructions and existing items which will
interfere with the construction, except as may be provided for in
these specifications and the plans.
B. All work within the limits of State highways shall be
performed in accordance with the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, "Regulations Governing Occupancy of
Highways by Utilities," 67 PA Code, Chapter 41.
C. In instances where proctor tests are required during the
excavation and backfilling for sanitary sewers and appurtenances as
defined in this Section, the costs of these tests shall be the
responsibility of the contractor.
2. Preparation and Excavation of the Trench.
A. General. The contractor shall perform all excavation of
every description and of whatever substances encountered to the lines
and grades indicated on the drawings and specified herein, or as
directed by the engineer. Excavation shall be made by open cut,
unless written permission to excavate in tunnel or bore is given by
the engineer or is specifically outlined in the specifications or
shown on the construction drawings. In general, trenches may be
excavated and backfilled either by machinery or by hand as the
contractor may elect; provided, however, the contractor shall use hand
excavation where necessary to protect existing structures, utilities,
or private or public properties; and, provided, further, that
backfilling shall be done by hand to the extent hereinafter specified.
The contractor shall have no claim for extra compensation due to the
fact that hand excavation, instead of machine excavation, may be made
necessary from any cause whatever.
B. Stripping, Excavation and Backfill.
(1) The contractor shall remove all paving, sub-paving,
curbing, gutters, brick, paving block, granite curbing, flagging
or other similar materials, and grub and clear the surface over
the area to be excavated. He shall properly store and preserve
such materials that may be required for future use in restoring
the surface. The contractor shall be responsible for any loss or
damage to the said materials because of careless removal or
neglectful or wasteful storage, disposal or use of the materials.
(2) All materials which may be removed, and all rock, earth
and sand taken from the excavation shall be stored, if practical,
in the roadway or such other suitable place and in such manner as
the engineer shall approve. In case more materials are removed
from any trench than can be backfilled over the completed pipe or
stored in the street, leaving space for traffic, the excess
materials shall be removed and stored at a suitable site provided
by the contractor. The contractor shall, at his own expense,
bring back as much of the approved materials so removed as may be
required to properly refill the trench. When directed by the
- 329-
(22, §302(2), cont'd) (22, §302(2), cont'd)
engineer, the contractor shall furnish such other suitable
materials as may be necessary to properly refill the trench at no
additional cost to the owner.
(3) The contractor shall restore all shrubbery, fences,
poles or other property and surface structures, removed or
disturbed as a part of the work, to a condition equal to that
before the work began, furnishing all labor and materials
incidental thereto, without any additional cost to the owner.
All items restored or replaced shall be maintained by the
contractor under the terms of the maintenance bond without
additional payment.
(4) The engineer may mark certain trees, shrubs, or other
items that are not to be disturbed or damaged. In the event such
items are disturbed or damaged, they shall be replaced or
compensated for at the contractor's expense.
C. Width of Trench.
(1) Pipe trenches shall be sufficiently true in alignment
to permit the pipe to be laid in the approximate center of the
trench. The trench shall be wide enough to provide a free
working space on each side of the pipe; however, the trench width
at least twelve (12) inch above the top of the outside barrel of
the pipe shall not exceed pay-line dimensions in the following
table. Payment for the work shall be paid for trench widths not
to exceed the pay-line dimensions in the following table:

(22, §302(2), cont'd) (22, §302(2), cont'd)
(2) Manholes, Valve Pits, and other Structures. The
pay-line shall be measured as one (1) foot outside the wall for
excavation and eighteen (18) inches outside the wall for
repaving.
(3) Where sheeting and shoring are used, the maximum
allowable width of trench as shown in the preceding table shall
be measured between the closest interior faces of the sheeting or
shoring as placed. Whenever, for any reason, the maximum trench
width is exceeded below the top of the pipe, the contractor may
be ordered by the engineer to cradle or encase the pipe in
concrete at the contractor's own expense in order to insure the
structural integrity of the pipe.
(3) If the maximum width of trench specified above cannot
be maintained, the contractor shall install temporary sheeting at
his own cost and expense. Where sewers are to be constructed on
rights-of-way or easements in open areas, the maximum width of
trench at the top specified hereinbefore may be exceeded only if
the construction is kept entirely within the limits of the
right-of-way or easements and can be carried on without damage to
adjoining property. The angle of slope shall be the angle at
which the trench bank will stand without sliding and in no case
shall the angle of slope be steeper than one-half (1/2) carried
on without damage to adjoining property. The angle of slope
shall be the angle at which the trenoh bank will stand without
sliding and in no case shall the angle of slope be steeper than
one-half (1/2) horizontal to one vertical. In locations other
than rights-of-way or easements, the engineer may, as warranted
by working conditions, and where permitted by the Pennsylvania
Department of Labor and Industry requirements, waive the requirements
that the maximum width of trench at the top shall not
exceed the dimensions specified hereinbefore. If the maximum
width requirement at the top is waived by the engineer, the
Contractor will not be entitled to additional compensation beyond
the specified trench widths.
(4) Where the engineer specifically requires the contractor
in writing to excavate beyond the maximum allowable trench width,
the contractor will be entitled to and will be reimbursed for the
quantity of material excavated beyond the specified trench widths
in accordance with the applicable unit prices contained in the
proposal.
D. Length of Trench.
(1) No trench shall be opened more than one hundred (100)
feet in advance of the pipe lines laid. The contractor shall
limit all trench openings to a distance commensurate with all
rules of safety.
(2) If the work is stopped either totally or partially, the
contractor shall refill the trench and temporarily repave over
the same at his expense and the trench shall not be opened until
he is ready to proceed with the construction of the pipeline.
E. Pumping and Draining. The contractor shall remove by
- 331 -
(22, §302(2), cont'd) (22, §302(2), cont'd)
pumping, draining, or otherwise, any water which may accumulate in the
trenches and other excavations and shall build all dams and do all
other work necessary to keep the trenches or other excavation as free
from water as possible. Where it is impractical to completely drain
the trench, special pipe or jointing materials may be authorized at no
additional expense to the owner. While the pipe lines are being laid,
the contractor shall have sufficient pumping machinery ready for
immediate use. All surface waters shall be prevented from entering
the open ditches or excavations by proper grading of the surface in
the vicinity of the excavation.
F. Maintenance of Gutters. Contractor shall keep the gutters
open at all times so that the flow of storm or other waters shall not
be obstructed. If the material excavated from the trenches must
temporarily extend over the gutters, it shall be the duty of the
contractor to plank or bridge over the gutters, without extra
compensation, so that the flow of water is not impeded. Erosion and
sediment control shall be exercised in accordance with all applicable
laws.
G. Maintenance of Traffic.
(1) Work shall be conducted so as to cause a minimum of
inconvenience to pedestrian and vehicular traffic and to private
and publio properties along the line of work. It shall be the
duty of the contractor, at all times to maintain crossings,
walks, sidewalks, and other roadways open to traffic and in a
satisfactory condition, and to keep all fire hydrants, water
valves, fire alarm boxes, and letter boxes accessible for use.
Whenever it is necessary to maintain pedestrian traffic over open
trenches, a timber bridge at least three (3) feet in width and
equipped with side railings shall be provided. When the
excavated material will encroach upon sidewalks or private
property, planking shall be placed in order to keep the sidewalk
or private property clear of excavated material.
(2) In important thoroughfares, highways, or in narrow
streets, the material excavated from the trench shall be removed
from the site of the work at the contractor's own expense in
order to provide suitable space for traffic. The contractor
shall, at his own expense, bring back as much of the approved
material as necessary to properly refill the trench; or he shall,
at his own cost and expense, furnish such other suitable
materials as may be necessary to properly refill the trench.
(3) When it is necessary to haul soft or wet materials over
public streets, the contractor shall provide suitable vehicles
and shall conform to all laws and ordinances relevant to such
hauling.
(4) Maintenance and protection of traffic on Borough
streets and State highways shall be in strict accordance with
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Form 408, Section 900,
Bulletin No. 43, "Maintenance and Protection of Traffic on
Construction Projects," and Publication No. 90, "Handbook for
Work Area Traffic Control," except as herein altered.

(22, §302(2), cont'd) (22, §302(2), cont'd)
(5) When working in other public rights-of-way, maintenance
of traffic shall be as directed by the governing authority.
(6) No special payment will be made for traffic maintenance
and protection.
H. Rock Excavation. Under this contract, all excavation shall
be unclassified; that is, the removal of all material of any nature,
kind, type or origin will be considered the same and shall be included
in the unit pricing as indicated in the proposal.
I. Blasting and Explosives.
(1) The use of explosives shall be governed by the
"Regulations for the Storage, Handling and the Use of Explosives"
of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.
(2) All blasts shall be properly matted and securely
covered. The contractor shall be solely responsible for injury
to persons or property located within or beyond the area or scope
of the project that may result from his use of explosives.
(3) All blasting shall be done under the supervision of a
competent blasting expert, and subject to the State, including
Department of Labor and Industry, County, or local regulations
for blasting. Whenever any pipe main or conduit is encountered
in the trench, the right is reserved to direct that all material
within five (5) feet of the same be removed by some method other
than blasting.
(4) The contractor will be responsible for the depths to
which all blasting is performed.
(5) Should any street paving adjoining any trench be
damaged in consequence of the contractor's blasting operations,
he shall immediately cease his blasting operations and repair the
damaged street paving; also, he shall not again proceed with any
blasting until he has submitted to and obtained approval from the
engineer.
J. Braced and Sheeted Trenches.
(1) Open cut trenches shall be sheeted and braced as
required by any governing Federal and State laws, and Borough
ordinances, and may be necessary to protect life, property, or
the work. The cost of furnishing, placing and removing the
sheeting and bracing necessary to protect life, property or the
work shall be included in the bid price for the pipe.
(2) The engineer reserves the right to order sheeting and
bracing left in place for the protection of the finished work or
adjacent property. Sheeting and bracing which have been ordered
left in place by the engineer must be removed for a distance of
three (3) feet below the established or existing grade, whichever
is lower. Trench bracing, except that which must be left in
place, may be removed when the backfilling has reached the
respective levels of such bracing. Payment for sheeting and
bracing ordered left in place by the engineer shall be paid for
in accordance with the bid price for this unit, which shall
- 333 -
(22, §302(2), cont'd) (22, §302(2), cont'd)
include the upper three feet or "cut-off" section of the
sheeting.
K. Protection of Utilities, Property and Structures.
(1) The existence and location of underground utilities as
indicated on the plans is presented merely to serve as a
notification that such utilities do exist in the general
proximity of the work. Any utilities not shown, or not located
as shown, shall not be cause for the contractor to deny
responsibility for their protection and/or repair during
construction.
(2) The contractor shall be held liable to cause all
utilities to be located prior to construction, and shall be held
liable for any damage done by reason of breaking of water, sewer,
gas, telephone, electrical, or other utility service.
(3) The contractor shall notify all utility companies in
advance of construction and cooperate with agents of these
companies during the progress of the work. Procedures for
emergency action and repairs to utilities shall be established
with the utility company prior to commencement of the work.
During the course of his work, if the contractor shall damage any
of the aforementioned utilities, he shall immediately follow the
procedure of emergency action and repair as established.
(4) Whenever the contractor, during the progress of the
excavation, shall uncover service pipes or lines, which because
of injury or age are in poor condition, he shall immediately
notify the proper authority in order that steps may be taken for
replacement or repair. Locations of repairs, and the procedures
of repairs that have been made shall be recorded by the
contractor.
(5) The contractor shall, at his own expense, sustain in
their places, and protect from direct or indirect injury, all
pipes, conduits, tracks, walls, buildings, and other structures
or property in the vicinity of his work, whether above or below
the ground, or that may appear in the trench. He shall at all
times have a sufficient quantity of timber and plank, chains,
ropes, etc., on the ground and shall use them as neoessary for
sheeting his excavations and for sustaining or supporting any
structures that are uncovered, undermined, endangered,
threatened, or weakened.
(6) Pipes and underground conduits exposed as a result of
the contractor's operations shall be adequately supported along
their entire exposed length by timber or planking, installed in
such manner that the anchorage of the supporting members will not
be disturbed or weakened during the backfilling operation.
Backfill of selected material shall be carefully rammed and
tamped under and around the supports and all supports shall be
left in place as a guard against breakage of the supported
structure due to trench settlement. No additional payment will
be due the contractor for material left in place nor for the
labor of installing and maintaining supports.
(22, §302(2), cont'd) (22, §302(2), cont'd)
(7) The contractor shall take all risks attending the
presence or proximity of pipes, poles, power lines or wires,
tracks, walls, buildings and other structures and property, of
every kind and description, in or over his trenches, or in the
vicinity of his work, whether above or below the surface of the
ground; and he shall along be responsible for all damages and
assume all expense for direct or indirect injury, caused by his
work, to any of them, or to any person or property by reason of
them or by reason of injury to them, whether such structures are
or are not shown on the drawings.
(8) Where necessary, in order to keep one (1) side of the
street or roadway free from any obstruction or to keep the
material piled alongside of the trench from falling on private
property outside the right-of-way, a safe and suitable fence
shall be placed alongside the trench.
(9) The cost of all work related to utility protection and
repair shall be included in the bid price for lineal feet of pipe
installed, or for the lump sum price of the contract. No
separate payment will be made for utility location or repairs.
L. Tunneling and Jacking.
(1) Tunneling shall be used only when permitted by the
engineer or required by the plans and specifications. Tunnels
for the laying of pipe lines shall be of sufficient size to allow
at all points the proper joining of pipes, and the proper
compacting of the refill around them. Tunnels shall be timbered
where and to such extent as may be necessary. Where rock is
encountered in tunnel, it shall be fully taken out to the lines
prescribed by the engineer without any additional payment.
Methods of tunneling or jacking used as may affect the
workmanship or quality of completed work or product shall be
changed from time to time at the cost of the contractor, if, in
the judgment of the engineer, conditions so require. Methods
involving safety to person or property shall be the sole
responsibility and liability of the contractor.
(2) Where sewers, service connections or other connections
cross under existing conduits and can be built in tunnel or
jacked, no additional compensation will be paid beyond the prices
bid per lineal foot for furnishing and laying pipe.
(3) Where excavation for the sewer is made in tunnel, the
prism of material removed shall conform as nearly as possible to
the dimensions specified or shown. Tunnels in earth shall be
properly braced and timbered in accordance with the most approved
method of soft ground tunneling.
(4) Where ordinary timber lining is used, the space between
such timber and the outer surface of the sewer shall be
completely filled with selected earth or other approved material,
rammed solidly between the sewer and the timber lining, or this
space shall be filled with concrete if ordered by the engineer,

(3) All carrier pipe in the tunnel shall be rigidly
anchored into position. Ends of tunnels shall be bricked shut
except that suitable drain opening shall be provided.
(4) All tunneling procedures and materials shall be
submitted by the contractor to the engineer, and approved by the
engineer, prior to commencement of the work.
N. Boring. When permitted by the engineer or required by the
plans and specifications, pipe under roadways may be laid by boring to
grade. The casing pipe shall be at least six (6) inches larger than
the outside diameter of the pipe bell, or as required by the owner of
the right-of-way or entity issuing the permit. Pipe sections shall be
made up and inserted through the casing pipe. Both ends shall then be
brought carefully to proper grade and wedged in place. Backfill shall
be sand blown in until the annular space between the carrier pipe and
the casing pipe is completely filled and compacted. All operations
shall be subject to the approval of the engineer and governing
authorities, or entity issuing permit.
3. Pipe Bedding and Trench Backfill.
A. Classification of Materials.
(1) Class 1. This material shall consist of sand, gravel,
or crushed stone approved by the engineer containing no stones
larger than two (2) inches in maximum dimension.
(2) Class 2. This material shall consist of excavated
material approved by the engineer and containing no stones larger
than two (2) inches in maximum dimension.
(3) Class 3. This material shall consist of excavated
material approved by the engineer and containing no stones larger
than eight (8) inches in maximum dimension. A maximum of twenty
- 336 -
(22, §302(3), cont'd) (22, §302(3), cont'd)
(20%) of the backfill volume may be stones so long as the stones
are evenly distributed within the material.
B. Bedding and Cradel. The trench shall be excavated to a depth
of six (6) inches below the outside diameter of the pipe barrel, or
deeper if so specified. The resultant subgrade shall be undisturbed,
or compacted as approved by the engineer if disturbed. The bedding
shall then be prepared by placing a thoroughly compacted Class 1
material in three (3) inch (uncompacted thickness) layers to pipe
centerline. Bedding shall provide uniform and continuous bearing and
support for the pipe at every point between bell holes. The cost of
the Class 1 material shall be included in the unit price bid for the
pipe.
C. Special Bedding.
(1) Concrete Cradle and Concrete Encasement. The trench
shall be excavated to a depth of six (6) inches below the outside
of the barrel of pipes twenty-four (24) inches in diameter or
less and nine (9) inches below the outside of the barrel of pipes
larger' than twenty-four (24) inches in diameter. All of this
excavation may be done by machine. Quality of concrete and
method of placement is specified elsewhere.
(2) Unstable Subgrade. Where the bottom of the trench at
subgrade is found to be unstable or to include ashes, cinders,
any type of refuse, vegetable, or other organic material, or
large pieces or fragments of inorganic material, which, in the
opinion of the engineer, should be removed, the contractor shall
excavate and remove such unsuitable material to the width and
depth recommended by the engineer. Before the pipe is laid, the
subgrade shall be made by backfilling with Class 1 material in
three (3) inch (uncompacted thickness) layers thoroughly tamped
and the bedding prepared as hereinbefore specified. Sand,
gravel, and crushed stone when used at the direction of the
engineer to stabilize trench subgrade will be paid for in
accordance with the unit price bid for crushed stone backfill at
the trench pay-line width specified in subsection (C), exclusive
of the ordinary bedding which shall be included in the unit price
for pipe. No payment will be made for the additional excavation
required to remove unstable material, since this cost is included
in the unit price bid for crushed stone backfill.
(3) Special Foundations. Where the bottom of the trench at
the subgrade is found to consist of material which is unstable to
such a degree that, in the opinion of the engineer, it cannot be
removed and replaced with an approved material thoroughly
compacted in place to support the pipe properly, the contractor
shall construct a foundation for the pipe, consisting of piling,
timbers or other materials, in accordance with plans prepared by
the engineer. Compensation for such additional work shall he in
accordance with the general conditions of the contract.
(4) Excavation in Fill. When the pipe is laid in fill, the
compacted embankment shall be brought to a height of at least
nine (9) inches above the proposed top of the pipe before the
trench is excavated.

the opinion of the engineer, is unsuitable. Backfill
material shall conform to the requirements established
under "Classification of Material."
2) Backfilling shall not be done in freezing
weather except by permission of the engineer, and it
shall not be made with frozen material. No fill shall
be made where the material already in the trench is
frozen.
3) In State highways, all backfill shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation "Regulations Governing
Occupancy of Highways by Utilities," 67 PA Code,
Chapter 41.

shall be of of Class 1 material.
(b) Excavated Materials.
1) When the type of backfill material is not
indicated on the drawings or specified, the contractor
may backfill with excavated material, provided that
such material consists of loam, clay, sand, gravel, or
other materials which, in the opinion of the engineer,
are suitable for backfilling.
2) Where excavated material is to be used for
backfill and there is a deficiency due to a rejection
of part thereof, the Contractor shall furnish the
required amount of approved material at no additional
cost.
(c) Sand, Gravel or Crushed Stone Backfill (Class I
Material)
1) Where sand, gravel, or crushed stone backfill
is not indicated on the drawings or specified herein,
and in the opinion of the engineer should be used in
any part of the work, the contractor shall furnish and
backfill with sand, gravel, or crushed stone as
directed. Payment shall be made in accordance with the
unit price bid for crushed stone backfill. No extra
compensation will be made for sand, gravel, or crushed
stone required for the pipe bedding, or due to
excavation made beyond the limits specified, or where
used as special bedding at the discretion of the
contractor.
2) All sand used for backfill shall be a natural
- 338 -
(22, §302(3), cont'd) (22, §302(3), cont'd)

placed to a depth of one and one-half (1-1/2) feet above the top of
the pipe, a light will be flashed between manholes or manhole
locations to determine whether the alignment of the sewer is true and
whether any pipe has been displaced, broken or otherwise damaged
subsequent to laying. This test will again be conducted before final
acceptance of the sewer. Each section (manhole to manhole) of sewer
shall show a good light circle throughout its length and any and all
defects all be corrected by the contractor, to the satisfaction of the
engineer, before the work shall proceed and before acceptance of
and/or payment therefor shall be made. Also, a mandrel with a
diameter of ninety-five (95%) of the inside diameter of the pipe must
be manually pulled through the pipe section to assure proper alignment
and that there is no debris in the pipe to cause obstructions.
B. Leakage Test.
(1) Air Testing.
(a) The contractor shall test each section of sewer
between manholes and all laterals to the limit of this
contract using low pressure air. Testing shall not be
performed for acceptance of the pipe by the owner until all
backfilling has been completed. The contractor may, at his
option, test the section of sewer for his own purposes,
prior to completion of backfilling; however, the requirements
of this subsection shall not be deemed to be completed
until the lines have been tested after the backfilling has
been completed and trench settlement has been minimized.
The costs of any testing incurred prior to authorization
from the engineer after backfilling has been completed shall
be borne by the contractor.
(b) A minimum period of two (2) minutes shall be
provided to allow equilibrium of the air temperature with
pipe wall before test readings shall commence. The rate of
air loss shall be determined by measuring the time interval
required for the average internal pressure to decrease by
one (1.0) psig.
(c) The initial test pressure to be developed in the
sewer and laterals shall be determined as follows:
1) For depths six (6) feet or less, the internal
pressure shall not be less than six (6.0) psig.
2) For depths greater than six (6) feet, the
internal pressure in psig shall be calculated as the
sum of three and one-half (3.5) plus the maximum height
in feet divided by two and three tenths (2.3) between
the invert of the sewer and the existing ground surface
in the section of sewer to be tested. (For example, if
the maximum height is determined to be ninety-two (92)
feet, the added pressure would be four (4.0) psig. The
initial test pressure in the sewer would then be seven
and one-half (7.5) psig. The allowable drop would be
to six and one-half (6.5) psig within the time
indicated elsewhere in this subsection).
- 362 -
(22, §304(11), cont'd) (22, §304(11), cont'd)
3) In no case shall the test pressure in the
sewers or laterals be greater than the maximum internal
differential joint pressure recommended by the
manufacturer of the pipe.
(d) The pipe shall be considered acceptable if the air
loss rate does not exceed 0.0030 cubic feet per minute per
square foot of internal pipe surface when tested at the
initial pressure previously defined in this subsection. The
time for the air pressure to decrease one (1.0) psig shall
not be less than the time indicated in the following table:
Pipe Diameter Minutes Seconds
6" 2 55
8" 3 57
10" 4 43
12" 5 40
15" 7 5
18" 8 30
21" 9 50
24" 11 20
27" 12 45
30" 14 10
36" 17 00
42" 19 50
48" 22 40
(e) If the above rates of leakage are exceeded, the
contractor shall, at his expense, determine source of
leakage and make all necessary corrections and retest.
(f) The contractor shall submit to the engineer for
approval the detailed test procedure and list of test
equipment he proposes to use prior to testing.
(2) Infiltration.
(a) After the air testing described in the preceding
subsection has been completed by the contractor, regardless
of any indications of the test results made by the engineer
or the owner, the engineer and owner reserve the right to
perform field investigations, prior to final written
acceptance of each sewer run by the owner and/or during the
maintenance period specified elsewhere in these
specifications, to establish the leakage of groundwater into
the sewer and laterals constructed under this contract. The
cost of these investigations shall be borne by the owner.
(b) Should the leakage exceed one hundred (100)
gallons per day per inch diameter per mile of pipe for any
section, the contractor shall, at the direction of the
engineer or owner, and at no cost to the owner, perform any
additional testing or corrective work required to reduce the
infiltration in each manhole run from those lines installed
by the contractor to less than one hundred (100) gallons per
day per inch diameter per mile of pipe. This leakage
applies to each manhole run separately and should not be
- 363 -
(22, §304(11), cont'd) (22, §304(11), cont'd)
construed to mean total leakage in the total system. The
scope of this corrective work shall include, but not be
limited to, cleaning, televising and testing the sewer and
laterals to the limits installed by the contractor, to
include testing and grouting of joints, excavation and
replacement of faulty or damaged portions of the work, and
all final restoration.
(3) Manhole Testing.
(a) The contractor shall conduct exfiltration tests on
all manholes. The contractor shall furnish all labor,
materials, water, tools, equipment and accessories necessary
to perform the required tests. All tests shall be made in
the presence of and to the complete satisfaction of the
engineer.
(b) The manhole shall be thoroughly cleaned and all
openings sealed to the satisfaction of the engineer. All
pipe openings in the base and the walls shall be plugged
with plugs properly designed to provide a watertight seal.
(c) After the manhole has been properly cleaned and
sealed, it shall be completely filled with water. In order
to make allowance for the amount of water which will be
absorbed by the manhole, the manhole to be tested shall be
completely filled with water for a period of 12 hours prior
to commencement of the test.
(d) At the time of commencement of the test, the
manhole shall be filled with water to a point level with the
top of the top manhole section. The amount of exfiltration
shall be determined from the loss in water level converted
into gallons per day. The manhole being tested shall be
considered "acceptable" when there is no perceptible loss in
water level.
(e) If any manhole fails to meet the exfiltration
requirements specified hereinbefore, the contractor shall
determine at his own expense the source or sources of
leakage. The contractor shall repair or replace all defective
material and/or workmanship and shall conduct such
additional retests as required to demonstrate that the
manhole meets the requirements, at his own expense and at no
additional cost to the owner. All materials and methods
used to repair the manholes shall meet with the approval of
the engineer.
(4) Hydrostatic Tests for Force Mains.
(a) Pressure Test. After the pipe has been laid and
backfilled as specified, all newly laid pipe, or any valved
section thereof, shall be subjected to a hydrostatic
pressure of one hundred (100) pounds per square inch, or
fifty (50%) in excess of the normal working pressure,
whichever is greater.
(b) Duration of Pressure Tests. The duration of each
- 364 -
(22, §304(11), cont'd) (22, §304(11), cont'd)
pressure test shall be at least four (4) hours.
(c) Procedure. Each section of pipe shall be slowly
filled with water and the specified test pressure, based on
the elevation of the lowest point of the line or section
under test and corrected to the elevation of the test gage,
shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe in
a manner satisfactory to the engineer. The pump, pipe
connections, and all necessary apparatus, including gauges,
shall be furnished by the contractor. The contractor will
make all taps into the pipe, and furnish all necessary
assistance for conducting the tests.
(d) Expelling Air Before Test. Before applying the
specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the
pipe.
(e) Examination Under Pressure. Any cracks or
defective pipes, fittings, or valves discovered in
consequence of this pressure test, shall be removed and
replaced by the contractor with sound material, and the test
shall be repeated until satisfactory to the engineer.
(f) Leakage Test.
1) A leakage test shall be conducted after the
pressure test has been satisfactorily completed. The
contractor will furnish the gage and all necessary
assistance to conduct the test. The duration of each
leakage test shall be two (2) hours, and during the
test the main shall be subjected to the pressure stated
in subsection (4)(a).
2) Leakage is defined as the quantity of water to
be supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved
section thereof, necessary to maintain the specified
leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled
with water and the air expelled.
3) No pipe installation will be accepted until
the leakage is less than ten (10.0) U. S. gallons per
twenty-four (24) hours per mile of pipe per inch
nominal diameter. The allowable leakage shall be
independent of the pipe laying length and the number of
joints per mile.
(g) Variation from Permissible Leakage. Should any
test of pipe laid disclose leakage greater than that
specified in subsection (4)(f), the contractor shall, at his
own expense, locate and repair the defective joints until
the leakage is within the specified allowance.
(h) Time for Making Test.
1) Asbestos cement pipe shall be filled with
water a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours prior to
making any leakage tests. All other pipe may be
subjected to hydrostatic pressure and inspected and
tested for leakage at any convenient time after the
- 365 -
(22, §304(11), cont'd) (22, §304(11), cont'd)
trench has been backfilled except at the joints, in
accordance with the specifications. The leakage
allowance for all mains shall be that specified in
subsection (4)(f).
2) Where any section of a main is provided with
concrete reaction backing, the hydrostatic pressure
test shall not be made until at least five (5) days
have elapsed after the concrete reaction backing was
installed. If high early strength cement is used in
the concrete reaction backing, the hydrostatic pressure
test shall not be made until at least two (2) days have
elapsed.
(5) Acceptance.
(a) Observation of successful testing of manholes,
sewers or force mains by the engineer does not constitute
acceptance of the system or any portion thereof. Upon
completion of any determined portion of a total system, and
sucesful testing thereof, thenginer may recomend final
acceptance to the owner. Only upon final inspection by the
owner or engineer, and upon written acceptance for same will
the system or portion thereof be considered substantially
completed. Upon such acceptance, the warranty period as
specified for the manholes, sewers or force mains will
commence.
(b) If, during this final inspection, any
irregularities are observed, the condition must be corrected
at the contractor's expense prior to acceptance.

required locations; spigots centered in bells; and all valves and
hydrant stems plumb.
E. Caution in Excavation. The contractor shall proceed with
- 372 -
(22, §305(6), cont'd) (22, §305(6), cont'd)
caution in the excavation and preparation of the trench so that the
exact looation of underground structures, both known and unknown, may
be determined, and he shall be held responsible for the repair of such
structures when broken or otherwise damaged because of carelessness on
his part.
C. Subsurface Explorations. Whenever, in the opinion of the
engineer, it is necessary to explore and excavate to determine the
location of existing underground structures, the contractor shall make
explorations and excavations for such purposes. If the contractor is
required to perform additional work in making the explorations and
excavations, extra compensation will be allowed for such additional
work.
D. Depth of Pipe. All pipe shall be laid to the depth shown on
the contract drawings or a minimum four (4) feet from grade to the
crown of pipe.
7. Installation.
A. Handling of Water Main Material into Trench. Proper
implements, tools, and facilities satisfactory to the engineer shall
be provided and used by the contractor for the safe and convenient
prosecution of the work. All pipe, fittings, valves and hydrants
shall be carefully lowered into the trench piece by piece by means of
a derrick, ropes, or other suitable tools or equipment, in such a
manner as to prevent damage to water main materials and protective
coatings and linings. Under no circumstances shall water main
materials be dropped or dumped into the trench.
B. Hammer Test. The pipe fittings shall be inspected for
defects and while suspended above grade, be rung with a light hammer
to detect cracks.
C. Cleaning Pipe and Fittings. All lumps, blisters and excess
coal tar coating shall be removed from the bell and spigot end of each
pipe, and the outside of the spigot and the inside of the bell shall
be wire-brushed and wiped clean and dry and free from oil and grease
before the pipe is laid.
D. Laying Pipe.
(1) Every precaution shall be taken to prevent foreign
material from entering the pipe while it is being placed in the
line. If the pipe-laying crew cannot put the pipe into the
trench and in place without getting into it, the engineer may
require that before lowering the pipe into the trench, a heavy,
tightly woven canvas bag of suitable size shall be placed over
each end and left there until the connection is to be made into
the adjacent pipe. During laying operations, no debris, tools,
clothing or other materials shall be placed in the pipe.
(2) After placing a length of pipe in the trench, the
spigot end shall be centered in the bell or coupling and the pipe
forced home and brought to correct line and grade. The pipe
shall be secured in place with approved backfill material tamped
under it except at the joints. Pipe and fittings which do not
allow a sufficient and uniform space for joints shall be removed
- 373 -
(22, §305(7), cont'd) (2, §305(7), cont'd)
and replaced with pipe and fittings of proper dimensions to
insure such uniform space.
(3) Precautions shall be taken to prevent dirt from
entering the joint space.
(4) At times when pipe laying is not in process, the open
ends of pipe shall be closed by a watertight lug or other means
approved by the engineer. Lead joints which cannot be poured
shall be caulked with packing to make them as watertight as
possible. This provision shall apply during the noon hour as
well as overnight. If water is in the trench, the seal shall
remain in place until the trench is pumped completely dry.
E. Cutting Pipe. The cutting of pipe for inserting valves,
fittings or closure pieces shall be done in a neat and workmanlike
manner, without damage to the pipe, so as to leave a smooth end at
right angles to the axis of the pipe.
F. Bell Ends to Face Direction of Laying. Bell and spigot pipe
shall be laid with bell ends facing in the direction of laying, unless
directed otherwise by the engineer.
G. Permissible Deflection of Joints. Wherever it is necessary
to deflect pipe from a straight line, either in the vertical or
horizontal plane, to avoid obstruction or plumb stems, or where long
radium curves are permitted, the amount of deflection allowed shall
not exceed that the recommended by the manufacturer, and shall be
approved by the Engineer.
H. Unsuitable Conditions for Laying Pipe. No pipe shall be laid
in water or when, in the opinion of the engineer, trench conditions
are unsuitable.
I. The plans of cross connections between new mains and existing
mains as shown on plans have been prepared from all available
information; however, should the existing mains when exposed vary in
size from that shown on the plans, the contractor shall provide the
necessary fitting for the cross connection and install the same at the
price bid. By reason of said changes should any surplus remain after
the completion of the contract, these fittings will be paid for at
cost to the contractor and become the property of the owner.
J. Variations. The engineer reserves the right to vary the line
and/or grade from that shown on the drawings for the pipe lines and
manholes and to vary the location of fittings, valves and hydrants
when such changes may be necessary or advantageous. No claims for
extra work will be allowed for changes in location or grade except as
such changes are made after trenching has been done.
K. Marking Line Locations. This shall be done by the following
method: there shall be placed a continuous metallic tape material
designating "Buried Water Line" vertically above water line and at a
depth of no less than eighteen (18) inches or no more than twenty-four
(24) below the surface of roadway or natural grade surface.
8. Jointing.

C. Galvanized Wrought Iron Pipe and Fittings. Threads shall be
neatly cut with sharp tools, and the jointing procedure shall conform
with the best practice. Before jointing, all scale shall be removed
from pipe by some suitable means, such as pounding. After cutting,
all pipe shall be reamed. All pipe shall be screwed together with and
application of an approved compound applied to all threads; and after
a joint has been screwed tight, it shall not be backed off unless the
threads are recleaned and new compound applied. This application
shall be neatly made, and all compound and dirt wiped off the inside
of each joint.

unless otherwise shown or directed, be so placed that the pipe and
fitting joints will be accessible for repair.
D. Metal Harness. Metal harness of tie rods or clamps of
adequate strength to prevent movement may be used instead of concrete
backing when directed by the Engineer. Steel rods or clamps shall be
galvanized or otherwise rustproof treated, or shall be painted as
directed by the Engineer.
12. Concrete Cradle and Encasement.
A. Preparation. Prior to the formtion of the cradle or
encasement, temporary supports consisting of solid concrete bricks or
cap blocks shall be used to support the pipe in place. Temporary
supports shall have minimum dimensions and shall support the pipe at
not more than two (2) locations, one (1) at the bottom of the barrel
of the pipe adjacent to the shoulder of the socket, and the other near
the spigot end.
B. Placing.
(1) After jointing of the pipe has been completed, concrete
- 377 -
(22, §305(12), cont'd) (22, §305(12), cont'd)
masonry shall be uniformly poured beneath and on both sides of
the pipe. Placement shall be done by the use of suitable
equipment.
(2) The concrete shall be wet enough during placement to
permit its flow, without excessive prodding, to all required
points around the pipe surface. The width of cradle shall be
such as to fill completely the trench width. In case of
extremely wide trenches, concrete encasement may be confined
above the top of the pipe to a narrower width, but in no case
shall it be less than the width of trench required for the size
of pipe being used.
(3) Before depositing concrete, the space within the limits
of the pour shall have been cleared of all debris and water.
Water shall not be allowed to rise adjacent to or flow over
concrete deposited for less than twenty-four (24) hours.
Concrete shall be protected from the direct rays of the sun and
kept moist by a method acceptable to the engineer for a period of
seven (7) days or until backfiling is begun. Ino case shal
backfilling begin within thirty-six (36) hours of the time of
placing and the engineer shall have strict control of the rate of
backfilling.
13. Blowoff Connection. Blowoff connections shall be installed where
called for on drawings. Unless otherwise shown on the drawings or
specified, each blowoff shall consist of a gate valve and box of the same
size as the water main, a reducer where necessary, four (4) inches bend
drilled for drainage, piece of four (4) inches pipe rising to the surface
and a valve box telescoped over the riser pipe. Blowoffs shall not be
connected to any sewer, submerged in any other manner, that will permit
back siphonage in the distribution system.
14. Manholes.
A. General. Manholes shall be constructed of brick, with cast
iron frames and covers, in the locations shown on the drawings or as
directed by the engineer and in accordance with the construction
details.
B. Concrete and mortar shall conform to the requirements
hereinbefore specified.
C. Brickwork. Brick shall be laid radially in a full bed of
mortar with interior joints not more than one-quarter (1/4) inch in
width. Whole brick only shall be used, except to effect closures and
to fill in the outside portion of the radial joints. Each seventh
(7th) course shall be laid as "stretchers," and intervening courses
being composed of "headers." The upper portion of the manhole shall
be drawn in equally and evenly as shown on the drawings to the
diameter required to fit the iron ring.
D. Frames, Covers and Steps. Cast iron frames and covers and
manhole steps shall conform to the drawings in all essentials of
design. Standard castings differing in nonessential details and
approved by the engineer will be acceptable. Frames and covers shall
be machined to produce a tight, rattle-proof fit. The frames and
covers shall be set that the top of the cover will be flush with or
- 378 -
(22, §305(14), cont'd) (22, §305(14), cont'd)
higher than finished grade as directed by the engineer. Steps when
shown on drawings or specified shall be furnished and set as manhole
construction progresses.
15. Hydrostatic Test.
A. Leakage Test.
(1) After the pipe has been laid and backfilled as
specified, all newly laid pipe, or any valved section thereof,
shall be subjected to a pressure of one hundred fifty (150)
pounds per square inch, or fifty (50%) percent in excess of the
normal working pressure, whichever is greater, in accordance with
A.W.W.A. Specification C-600.
(2) Leakage is defined as the quantity of water to be
supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved section thereof,
necessary to maintain the specified leakage test pressure after
the pipe has been filled with water and the air expelled.
(3) No pipe installation will be accepted until the leakage
is less than the number of gallons per hour as determined by the
formula:
L = SD V
133,200
in which "L" equals the allowable leakage in gallons per hour;
"S" is the length of pipeline tested in feet; "D" is the nominal
diameter of the pipe, in inches and "P" is the average test
pressure during the leakage test, in pounds per square inch
gauge. (The allowable leakage according to the formula is
equivalent to eleven and sixty-five hundreths (11.65) U.S.
gallons per twenty-four (24) hours per mile of pipe per inch
nominal diameter, evaluated on a pressure basis of one hundred
fifty (150) psi).
B. Duration of Test. The duration of the test under pressure
shall be two (2) hours
C. Procedure. Each valved section shall be slowly filled with
water and the specified test pressure, based on the elevation of the
lowest point of the line or section under test and corrected to the
elevation of the test gage, shall be applied by means of a pump
connected to the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. The
pump, pipe connections, and all necessary apparatus, including gauges,
shall be furnished by the contractor. The contractor will make all
taps into the pipe, and furnish all necessary assistance for
conducting the tests.
D. Expelling Air Before Test. Before applying the specified
test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If hydrants
or blowoffs are not available at high places, the contractor shall
make the necessary taps at points of highest elevation before the test
is made and insert the plugs after the test has been completed.
E. Variation from Permissible Leakage. Should any test of pipe
- 379 -
(22, §305(15), cont'd) (22, §305(15), cont'd)
laid disclose leakage greater than that specified in subsection (A),
the contractor shall, at his own expense, locate, repair, and replace
the defective joints, pipe or fittings until the leakage is within the
specified allowance.
F. Time for Making Test.
(1) All pipe may be subjected to hydrostatic pressure and
inspected and tested for leakage at any convenient time after the
trench has been partially backfilled except at the joints in
accordance except at the joints in accordance with the
specifications. The leakage allowance for all mains shall be
that specified in subsection (A).
(2) Where any section of a main is provided with concrete
reaction backing, the hydrostatic pressure test shall not be made
until at least five (5) days have elapsed after the concrete
reaction backing was installed. If high early strength cement is
used in the concrete reaction backing, the hydrostatic pressure
test shall not be made until at least two (2) days have elapsed.
16. Sterilization of Lines.
A. Preliminary Flushing. Prior to sterilization, the lines
shall be flushed as thoroughly as possible with the water pressure and
outlets available. Flushing shall be done after the line leakage test
has been made.
B. Chlorination of Completed Line.
(1) Before being placed in service, the entire line shall
be chlorinated in accordance with A.W.W.A. Specification C-651.
Chlorine may be applied by the following methods: Liquid
chlorine and calcium hypochlorite granules, sodium hypochlorite
solution and calcium hypochlorite tablets.
(2) The chlorinating agent shall be applied at the
beginning of the section adjacent to the feeder connection and
shall be injected through a corporation cock, hydrant, or other
connection insuring treatment of entire line.
(3) Water shall be fed slowly into new line with chlorine
applied in amounts to produce a dosage of forty (40) to fifty
(50) p.p.m. Mains previously filled shall be treated to a
concentrated dosage at intervals along the line and retained for
a period of eight (8) hours or more. A residual of not less than
five (5) p.p.m. shall be produced in all parts of the line.
(4) During the chlorination process, all valves and
accessories shall be operated.
(5) After chlorination, the water shall be flushed from the
line at its extremities until the replacement water tests are
equal chemically and bacteriologically to those of the permanent
source of supply.
C. Liquid Chlorine. Chlorine gas-water mixture shall be applied
by means of a solution feed chlorinating device. Chlorine gas shall
be fed directly from a chlorine cylinder equipped with suitable device
for regulating the rate of flow and the effective diffusion of gas
- 380 -
(22, §305(16), cont'd) (22, §305(16), cont'd)
within the pipe.
D. Calcium Hypochlorite. Calcium hypochlorite shall be
comparable to commercial products known as H.T.H., perchloren, and
maxochlor, a solution consisting of five (5%) percent of powder to
ninety-five (95%) of water by weight, should be prepared. The calcium
hypochlorite and water mixture, first made into a paste and then
thinned to a slurry, shall be injected or pumped into the newly laid
line under the conditions specified hereinbefore.
E. Final Flushing. Following chlorination all treated water
shall be thoroughly flushed from the line, at its extremities, until
the replacement water throughout its length, upon test, be proved
comparable to the quality of water in the existing distribution
system.
F. Bacteriological Tests. Chlorination of the completed line
and the necessary bacteriological tests shall be done at the expense
of the contractor as part of the construction contract. No separate
or extra payments will be made for performing any of this work.

(1) The coarse material shall be rolled and thoroughly
compacted with an approved three (3) wheel roller. The rolling
shall begin at the sides and progress to the center, except on
superelevated curves where the rolling shall begin on the low
side and progress to the high side.
(2) The rolling shall be parallel with the centerline of
the roadway, uniformly lapped each preceding track, covering the
entire surface with the rear wheels and continuing until the
material does not creep or wave ahead of the roller wheels.
J. Application of Final Layer. A final layer of 2RC or 2A stone
shall be placed on the second layer after it is completed. The final
layer shall be compacted as specified in subsection (I).
K. Surface Tolerance. After the base course has been completed
as specified, the surface smoothness shall be checked with approved
templates and straightedges, as specified. Any surface irregularities
that exceed inch under a template or straightedge shall be remedied to
the satisfaction of the engineer by loosening the surface and removing
or adding material as required, after which the entire area, including
the surrounding surface, shall be rolled until it is satisfactorily
compacted.
L. Tests for Depth of Finished Base Course.
(1) During the progress of the work, the depth of the base
course will be determined by the engineer and unsatisfactory work
shall be repaired, corrected, or replaced. The Borough will not
be liable for payment for any excess depth of base course.
(2) The initial layer of fine material placed as a bed and
filler will be measured and considered as part of the base course
in determining the compacted depth of the finished course.
(3) The depth will be determined by cutting or digging
holes to the full depth of the completed base course. One (1)
depth measurement shall be made for each three thousand (3,000)
square yards, or less, or completed base course. Any section in
which the depth is one-half (1/2) inch or more deficient in
specified depth, shall be removed and satisfactorily replaced at
no expense to the Borough.
(4) All tests holes shall be cut or dug, backfilled with
similar material, and satisfactorily compacted by and at the
expense of the contractor. This operation shall be under the
direct supervision of the inspector who will check the depth for
record purpose.
M. Maintenance and Traffic.
(1) The contractor shall maintain the completed base
course, until the placement of the surface course.
- 384 -
(22, §306(3), cont'd) (22, §306(3), cont'd)
(2) No traffic shall be allowed on the base course other
than necessary local traffic and that developing from the
operation of essential construction equipment, unless otherwise
directed by the engineer. Any defects which may develop in the
construction of the base course or any damage caused by the
operation of local or job traffic is the responsibility of the
contractor and shall be immediately repaired or replaced at no
expense to the Borough.

the requirements of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
specifications Form 408, latest revision.
D. Hauling Equipment. The binder course and wearing material
shall be hauled to the work in tight vehicles. Vehicles shall be
previously cleaned of all foreign material and be free of any
petroleum oils, volatiles, or other solvents which may adversely
affect the bituminous concrete. Approved covers of sufficient size
and quality to protect the entire load, under all conditions, shall be
provided. When necessary, provisions shall be made for proper
insulation of the vehicle to insure that the mixture is delivered at
the correct laying temperature, free from lumps of chilled material.
The dispatching of the vehicles shall be arranged so that all material
delivered shall be placed and rolled during daylight hours, unless
mitigating circumstances require the work to be performed otherwise.
E. Bituminous Pavers.
(1) Bituminous pavers shall be self-contained,
power-propelled units, provided with an activated screed or
strike-off assembly, heated if necessary, and capable of
spreading and finishing courses of bituminous plant mix material
in lane widths applicable to the specified typical section and
depth(s) shown on the drawings. The paver shall be capable of
being operated at forward speeds consistent with satisfactory
laying of the mixture. Payers used for shoulders and similar
construction shall be capable of spreading and finishing courses
of bituminous plant mix material in widths shown on the drawings.
(2) The paver shall be equipped with a receiving hopper
having sufficient capacity for a uniform spreading operation.
The hopper shall be equipped with a distribution system to place
the mixture uniformly in front of the screed.
(3) The screed or strike-off assembly shall effectively
produce a finished surface of the required evenness and texture
without tearing, shoving, or gouging the mixture.
(4) Equipment causing tracks or leaving indented areas not
corrected by the scheduled operation, or producing flushing or
other permanent blemishes, or failing to produce a satisfactory
surface shall not be used. Blade graders or drags will not be
permitted.
F. Rollers. Rollers shall be of the steel-wheel and
pneumatic-tire types.
G. Conditioning of Existing Surface and Structures.
(1) The contractor shall remove and dispose of all fatty
and other unsuitable materials from the surface of existing
pavement. He shall also remove and dispose of excess joint
sealer and crack filler from rigid pavements, and shall seal open
joints and cracks with Class J-1 bituminous material to within
one-quarter (1/4) inch of the surface of the existing pavement
and immediately cover with a light coating of approved dry sand.
Open cracks more than one (1) inch wide shall be filled with a
- 386 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
suitable fine bituminous concrete mixture.
(2) All depressions of one (1) inch or more in depth shall
be patched with binder or wearing material as directed, then
thoroughly compacted ahead of surfacing operations.
(3) Prior to the arrival of the binder course mixture, the
base shall be cleaned of all loose and foreign materials.
(4) The vertical surface of curbs, structures, gutters, and
existing paving in contact with bituminous mixtures, shall be
painted with a uniform coating of bituminous material of the
class and type designated for the surface course.
(5) A prime coat shall be applied when indicated on the
drawing or specified in the proposal.
(6) A tack coat shall be applied to existing concrete,
brick, or block pavements or concrete base courses.
(7) A tack coat shall not be applied to new bituminous base
courses or existing bituminous pavements unless indicated on the
drawings or specified in the proposal. However, a tack coat
shall be applied to a new bituminous base course or binder course
when, in the opinion of the engineer, the condition of the
surface is unsatisfactory for the direct placement of the
succeeding operation.
H. Spreading and Finishing.
(1) The temperature of the binder or wearing course mixture
when laid shall not vary more than fifteen (15°F) degrees
Farhenheit from the temperature of the completed mixture at the
plant.
(2) When unforeseen delays in paving are encountered, a
limited tonnage may be placed provided the temperature of the
mixture at the time does not vary more than twenty-five (25°F)
degrees Fahrenheit from the mixed temperature. Samples of the
compacted pavement in which it is used shall comply with the
specified density requirements. If the density requirements are
not met, the faulty paving shall be removed and replaced.
(3) The mixture shall be spread or struck off by mechanical
spreading and finishing equipment for the entire width or for
such partial-width lanes as may be practical. The screed
assembly shall be operated to provide a binder course or wearing
course of the required depth.
(4) When the production of the mixture can be maintained
and, when practical, pavers shall be used in echelon to place the
surface courses in adjacent lanes.
(5) On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles
make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing equipment
impracticable the mixture shall be placed and screened by hand
tools to give the required compacted depth.
(6) Adjacent to flush curbs, gutters, liners, and
structures, the surface mixture shall be placed uniformly high so
- 387 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
that, when compacted, it will be slightly above the edge of the
abutting structure.
(7) When the wearing course is placed adjacent to curbs to
form a bituminous gutter and before the surface has cooled, it
shall be sealed with hot bituminous material of the class and
type designated for the surface course for a distance of twelve
(12) inches from the curb. The sealing material shall be evenly
applied to the surface by means of squeegees immediately after
final rolling and sealed with hot irons to completely fill the
surface voids and provide a watertight joint along the curb.
Excess bituminous material shall be removed from the wearing
course.
I. Compaction.
(1) Immediately after the bituminous mixture has been
spread, struck off, and surface irregularities adjusted, it shall
be thoroughly and uniformly compacted by rolling.
(2) The surface shall be rolled when the mixture is in the
proper condition and when the rolling does not cause undue
displacement, cracking, or shoving.
(3) The number, weight, and type of rollers furnished shall
be sufficient to obtain the required compaction while the mixture
is in a workable condition. The sequence of rolling operations
and the selection of roller types shall provide the specified
pavement density.
(4) The rollers shall be normally operated so that the
breakdown rolling is performed with a three (3) wheel or tandem
roller, the intermediate rolling with a pneumatic-tired roller,
and the finish rolling with a tandem roller. When an approved
vibratory roller is used for breakdown rolling in the vibratory
mode, intermediate rolling with a pneumatic-tired roller will not
be required. When the vibratory roller is used for finish
rolling, it shall be used in the static mode. Rolling shall
progress continuously until the specified density, ninety-five
(95%) percent of the corresponding daily plant Marshall density,
has been attained. Finish rolling shall continue until all
roller marks are eliminated.
(5) Unless otherwise directed, rolling shall start
longitudinally at the sides and gradually progress toward the
center of the pavement, except on superelevated curves, where the
rolling shall begin on the low side and progress to the high
side, overlapping on successive trips by at least (1/2) the width
of pneumatic-tired rollers and tandem rollers and uniformly
lapping each preceding track or covering the entire surface with
the rear wheels when three (3) wheel rollers are used.
(6) The motion of the rollers shall be slow enough at all
times to avoid displacement of the hot mixture and any
displacement resulting from reversing the direction of the
rollers, or from any other cause, shall be satisfactorily
corrected.
- 388 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
(7) The wheels of steel-wheel rollers shall be kept moist
and clean to prevent adhesion of the fresh material, but an
excess of water will not be permitted. Pneumatic-tired roller
wheels shall be kept clean by an approved method to prevent
adhesion of the fresh material.
(8) When either the binder or wearing course fails to
comply with the density requirements herein specified, additional
compaction may be applied, when permitted and as directed, to
attain the required density. If satisfactory density cannot be
attained, the contractor shall be required to remove and replace
any affected area.
(9) Immediately after placing the binder or wearing course,
the exposed outer edges shall be rounded or beveled with an
approved mechanical edger or approved hand tools to avoid a
sharp, ragged, open, or unfinished appearance. Adequate
precaution shall be taken to prevent a breakdown of the edges.
Should breakdowns occur, they shall be immediately repaired.
(10) All irregularities in the binder course shall be
remedied before the wearing course is placed. Insofar as
practical, no traffic shall be permitted on the binder course,
and all binder becoming coated with any foreign material shall be
satisfactorily cleaned and treated as specified in subsection
(G). If the binder course cannot be satisfactorily cleaned, it
shall be removed and replaced.
(11) When required for the wearing course, complete
transverse and longitudinal rolling and two (2) diagonal
rollings, approximately at right angles to each other, shall be
performed.
(12) For a distance of eight (8) inches around all
structures, adjacent to curbing, gutters, railway tracks, and all
other locations inaccessible to rollers, the compaction shall be
effected with hot iron tampers weighing not less than twenty-five
(25) pounds and having a bearing area not exceeding forty-eight
(48) square inches, or with mechanical vibrating hand tempers,
when approved.
(13) Any mixture that becomes loose and broken, mixed with
dirt, or is in any way defective shall be removed and replaced
with fresh hot mixture, which shall be compacted to conform with
the surrounding area. Any area showing an excess or deficiency
of bituminous material shall be removed and replaced.
J. Joints.
(1) Longitudinal Joints.
(a) The longitudinal joint in one (1) layer shall
offset the previous joint in the layer immediately below by
approximately six (6) inches; however, the joint in the top
layer shall be at the centerline of the pavement if the
roadway comprises two (2) lane width, or at lane lines, if
the roadway is more than two (2) lanes in width.
(b) Satisfactory longitudinal joints shall be obtained
- 389 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
for both binder and wearing courses in the following manner:
The material in abutting lanes shall be tightly crowded
against the vertical face of previously placed lanes. The
paver shall be operated so that, in spreading, the material
overlaps the edge of the lane previously placed by
approximately three (3) inches. To assure a true line, the
machine shall closely follow lines or markings placed for
this purpose. The depth of the uncompacted mixture being
placed adjacent to a previously compacted lane shall be kept
uniformly high to provide for the required cross section
after compaction. The depth of the overlapped material
shall be kept uniform, so that rolling will not result in an
irregular, rough joint. Before rolling, the coarse
aggregate in the material overlapping the joint shall be
carefully broomed onto the surface of the unrolled lane,
leaving behind only the fine portion of the mixture which
shall be tightly pressed into the compacted lane at the time
the joint is rolled. The brooming shall not be delayed but
shall be done directly after the material has been spread by
the paver.
(c) Where practical, only short sections normally less
than twenty-five (25) feet in length shall be left where the
abutting lane is not placed the same day. Where the
abutting lane is not placed the same day, or when the
abutting lane has cooled to less than one hundred fifty
(150°F) degrees, or where the abutting joint is distorted
during the day's work by traffic or from any other cause,
the edge of the lane shall be carefully trimmed to line as
required and either painted with a very thin coating of
bituminous material of the class and type designated for the
surface course or heated with an infrared heater.
(d) Infrared Heater.
1) Where the abutting lane is not placed during
the same day, or where the temperature in the abutting
lane has cooled to less than one hundred fifty (150°F)
degrees, an approved infrared heater may be used in
constructing longitudinal joints. The heater shall be
so constructed and mounted on the spreading and
finishing equipment that adjustment of the applied heat
can be readily accomplished.
2) The heater shall be capable of uniformly
heating the material in that portion of the joint
against which the additional lane is being placed, to a
temperature within twenty-five (25°F) degrees
Fahrenheit of laying temperature for the particular
binder or wearing course being placed.
3) Provision shall be made for automatically
turning on the heater when the spreading and finishing
equipment is started and turning it off when it is
stopped. Residual heat, after the heater has been shut
off, shall not be sufficient to damage the bitumen in
- 390 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
the joint material. There shall be positive windproof
ignition on each generator, and the generators shall be
so arranged that if one (1) of the ignition points
fails to operate, the others will act to re-ignite the
generator. The ignition system shall be in operation
all the time the joint heater is in use, to preclude
the possibility of the heater or gas pilots being put
out of action by gusts of wind or the suction generated
by passing traffic.
4) There shall be no bypass around the automatic
shut off to permit non-automatic operation of the
heater. However, a switch which will allow the operator
to override the automatic system will be approved
for warming up the heater before starting or during
long delays in operation. This switch shall be designed
to activate the equipment only while being held in
plaoe by the operator during the "warmup" period.
5) When a heater is used, painting of the
vertical face of the joint with bituminous cement will
not be required. If the edge of the lane is distorted
by traffic or from any other cause, it shall be
carefully trimmed to line.
(2) Transverse Joints.
(a) Transverse joints, in both binder and wearing
courses, shall be carefully constructed, sawing of joints is
permitted, and thoroughly compacted to provide a smooth
riding surface. Joints shall be straight-edged to assure
smoothness. If the line of joint is formed with a bulkhead,
it shall form a straight line and vertical face. The joint
face then will not have to be trimmed before fresh material
is placed against it to complete the joint. If a bulkhead
is not used to form the joint and the roller is permitted to
roll over the end of the new material, the line of joint
shall be located back of the rounded edge a sufficient
distance and trimmed to provide a true surface and cross
section. In either case, the joint face shall be painted
with a very thin coating of bituminous material of the class
and type designated for the surface course before the fresh
material is placed against it. To obtain thorough
compaction of these joints, cross rolling may be required.
(b) Infrared Heater. An approved infrared heater be
used, as specified for longitudinal joints.
K. Pavement Samples.
(1) Unless otherwise directed, density and record samples,
each approximating a twelve (12) inch by twelve (12) inch slab,
shall be cut from the completed binder course and wearing course,
utilizing a power-driven, water-cooled, abrasive, circular saw in
accordance with the requirements of this subsection or by
drilling to obtain cores of a minimum diameter of eight (8)
inches for record samples and a minimum of four (4) inches for
- 391 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
density samples.
(2) All holes resulting from sampling shall be backfilled
with acceptable material and satisfactorily compacted. All
materials, equipment, tools, labor, and work incidental to the
sampling and backfilling of the resulting holes shall be
furnished by the contractor at no expense to the Borough.
(3) Density Samples.
(a) At each location designated by the Engineer, prior
preparation shall be made by placing a suitable material on
the underlying course to prevent adhesion of the sample. At
least one sample representing each day's production of
binder course and/or wearing course shall be sawed or
drilled from the surface. Before removal from the surface,
the slab samples shall be cut into sections as directed, to
provide specimens of a suitable size for testing, and care
shall be taken that the samples are not compressed, bent, or
distorted in any way during cutting, handling, transporting
or storage. The samples shall be accurately identified and
delivered for testing to the plant laboratory by the
contractor. The samples, immediately after delivery, shall
be tested for density at the plant laboratory. Each test
shall consist of the average of the results obtained on at
least two (2) specimens of the required size taken from each
slab sample. The density shall be reported as field
density, computed and reported as percent of Marshall plant
density, based on the average of the Marshll plant densities
obtained during the corresponding day's production.
(b) Density may also be determined in accordance with
PTM No. 402.
(c) When unsatisfactory compaction is indicated by
tests, check samples shall be taken, to provide samples of
either the binder or wearing course which are suitable for
testing. Check samples of wearing course shall be removed
by sawing or core drilling through both the wearing and
binder courses, and preparing the samples for testing by
sawing off the underlying binder course.
(4) Record Samples.
(a) At random locations selected by the Engineer,
samples shall be cut or drilled from the completed binder
course and wearing course as outlined in subsection (j).
However, at least one (1) sample shall be taken from the
binder course and one (1) sample from the wearing course on
projects where the tonnage being placed is ten thousand
(10,000) or less, and at least two (2) samples of binder
course and two (2) samples of wearing course on projects
where the tonnage being placed is over ten thousand
(10,000). These samples shall be accurately identified and
delivered for testing to the Bureau of Materials, Testing
and Research.
(b) As indicated, these samples are for record
- 392 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (22, §307(5), cont'd)
purposes and will not necessarily be used to accept or
reject the completed work. The cutting, core drilling and
removal of these samples shall be under the direct
supervision of the materials engineer.
L. Surface Tolerance. For the purpose of determining the
surface tolerance, the finished surface shall be tested with a ten
(10) foot straightedge. The straightedge shall be held in successive
positions parallel to the road centerline in contact with the surface,
and the whole area checked from one (1) side to the other as
necessary. Advance along the pavement shall be in successive stages
of not more than the length of the straightedge. Any irregularities
which vary from the testing edge of the straightedge between any two
(2) contacts with the surface by more than three-sixteenth (3/16) inch
shall be satisfactorily corrected. Irregularities which may develop
before the completion of rolling shall be remedied by loosening the
surface mixture and removing or adding material as required. Should
any irregularities or defects remain after the final compaction, the
surface course shall be promptly removed and sufficient new material
laid to form a true and even surface, or otherwise satisfactorily
corrected. All minor surface projections, joints, and minor
honeycombed surfaces shall be ironed smoothly to grade, as may be
directed.
M. Tests for Depth of Surface Courses.
(1) The Borough will not be liable for payment for any
excess in depth of binder and wearing courses. Before final
acceptance of the project, or during the progress of the work,
the depth of the binder and wearing course will be determined by
the engineer, and unsatisfactory work shall be repaired,
replaced, or corrected.
(2) The depth of the courses shall be controlled by the
weight per square yard. The quantity of material placed shall be
adjusted on the basis of the following combined tests, in order
that the required depth is secured.
(3) After initial compaction, preliminary tests as an aid
for controlling the depth, shall be made by inserting a flat
blade, correctly graduated, through the material to the top of
the base. These tests shall consist of at least 5 measurements
for each one hundred (100) square yards.
(4) After final compaction, a series consisting of three
(3) holes, each approximately three (3) inches square, may be
required to be cut through the surface course to the top of the
base. Each series shall represent not more than one thousand
(1,000) square yards. The first series shall be cut, one (1) at
the center and one (1) near each edge; and the second series, one
(1) at the center and one (1) at each quarter point. The series
shall be alternated and continued throughout the length of the
project.
(5) Surface courses deficient more than one-fourth (1/4)
inch from the specified depth shall be removed and replaced to
the correct depth, or otherwise satisfactorily corrected.
- 393 -
(22, §307(5), cont'd) (33, §307(5), cont'd)
(6) When tests show that the pavement is uniformly more
than one-eights (1/8) inch deficient in depth in three (3) or
more adjoining sections, these sections shall be removed and
replaced to the correct depth, or otherwise satisfactorily
corrected.
(7) The checking of depth and cutting of test holes, also
refilling and compaction with acceptable materials, shall be done
by and at the expense of the contractor under the direct
supervision of the inspector.
N. Protection of Surface Courses.
(1) Vehicular traffic or loads shall not be permitted on
the newly completed surface course until adequate stability and
adhesion have been attained and the material has cooled
sufficiently to prevent distortion of loss of fines.
(2) The contractor shall maintain the surface courses.
6. Bituminous Binder Course ID-2.

A. Forms.
(1) Forms for the curb shall be of metal, except wood forms
may be used on sharp curves and short tangent sections when
approved by the engineer. Forms shall be straight, free from
warp, and of sufficient strength when staked to resist the
- 396 -
(22, §308(3), cont'd) (22, §308(3), cont'd)
pressure of the concrete without springing. At least three (3)
stakes shall be provided for each ten (10) feet of form. Metal
forms shall be of approved section and shall have a flat surface
on top and wood forms shall be nominal two (2) inch surfaced
planks. These forms shall be of a depth equal to the depth of
the curb, designed to permit secure fastening of the face and
back forms at the tops. These fastenings shall be constructed in
a manner that will not obstruct satisfactory finishing and edging
of the top of the curb but will permit removal of the inside or
face forms. The outside or back forms shall be straight from top
to bottom. The inside of the face forms shall have a batter from
the top of the curb to the finished surface line of the pavement,
as indicated on the standard drawings, and shall be straight from
this line to the bottom.
(2) All forms and templates shall be thoroughly cleaned and
treated with an approved material as required, to prevent the
concrete from adhering thereto. Oil, bituminous paper, or other
material which will adhere to or discolor the concrete shall not
be used. The forms shall be accurately set to line and grade in
a manner to prevent settlement or displacement.
B. Excavation. Excavation shall be made to the required depth,
and the material upon which the curb is to be constructed shall be
compacted to a firm, even surface.
C. Placing and Finishing Concrete. The concrete shall be placed
in the forms in horizontal layers not to exceed five (5) inches, and
spaded sufficiently to eliminate all voids. An approved vibrator may
be used when permitted by the Engineer. Where indicated or directed,
drainage openings shall be made through the curb at the elevation and
of the size required. The curb shall be depressed as indicated or
directed. The top surface of the curb shall be finished true to line
and grade in a smooth, neat, and even manner by means of wood floats,
and the edges of the face and back shall be rounded to a radius of not
more than three-quarters (3/4) of an inch and one-quarter (1/4) of an
inch, respectively, while the concrete is still plastic.
D. Curb Machine.
(1) Plain cement concrete curb may be placed with a
self-propelled machine consisting of a hopper, power-driven screw
or screws and a metering device.
(2) Concrete shall be uniformly fed to the machine and
after extension, the concrete will maintain the shape of the
section without slumping.
E. Joints.
(1) Contraction joints shall be spaced in uniform lengths
or sections of ten (10) feet maximum, except where shorter
sections are necessary for closures or curves, but no section
shall be less than four (4) feet.
(2) Contraction joints may be either hand-formed or sawed
joints. They shall be three-sixteenth (3/16) inch wide and two
(2) inches deep. Sawing of joints shall be done as soon as
- 397 -
(22, §308(3), cont'd) (22, §308(3), cont'd)
practicable after the concrete has set sufficiently to preclude
raveling during the sawing and before any shrinkage cracking
occurs in the concrete. The saw cut depth may be decreased at
the edge adjacent to the pavement to obtain a maximum depth that
will avoid damage to the pavement. Construction joints shall
have tooled edges.
(3) The one-quarter (1/4) inch premoulded expansion joint
material shall be cut to conform to the cross sectional area and
be placed at structures and at the end of a day's work.
F. Removal of Forms.
(1) The forms shall not be removed within twelve (12) hours
after the concrete has been placed. No rubbing to correct
irregularities will be permitted until the full curing period has
elapsed. Any irregular surface shall be corrected by rubbing
with a carborundum stone. Brush finishing or plastering will not
be permitted and all rejected curb shall be promptly removed and
replaced at no expense to the Department.
(2) After the forms are removed, minor defects shall be
filled with mortar composed of one (1) part of cement and two (2)
parts of fine aggregate.
G. Curbing. The curb shall be cured and protected with either
membrane or water curing.
H. Backfilling.
(1) As soon as possible after the removal of forms, the
spaces in front and back of the curb shall be backfilled with
approved material in layers of not more than four (4) inches in
depth, which shall be thoroughly compacted mechanically to the
required elevation and cross section. The layers shall be placed
by alternating between the front and back of the curb.
(2) The areas back of raised curbs shall be constructed and
completed as shown on the drawings and/or cross sections. The
engineer may permit the use of a five (5) to eight (8) ton roller
in these areas.
(Ord. 393, 4/3/1990, §308)
§309. Cement Concrete Sidewalks.
1. Scope. This work shall consist of constructing cement concrete
sidewalks in accordance with these Specifications and within reasonably
close conformity to the lines, grades, and dimensions shown on the drawings
or established by the engineer.

be formed at a depth of eight (8) inches below and parallel with the
finished surface of the sidewalk, unless otherwise indicated on the
drawings or specified. Unsuitable material shall be removed and
replaced with approved material and the foundation shall be thoroughly
compacted and finished to a firm, even surface.
B. Placing Aggregate for Bed.
(1) The approved aggregated shall be spread on the prepared
foundation to form a compacted bed four (4) inches in depth,
unless otherwise indicated on the drawings or specified. This
material shall be thoroughly compacted.
(2) Satisfactory outlets for draining the bed shall be
provided.
C. Forms. Forms shall be of wood or metal, straight, free from
warp, and of sufficient strength when staked to resist the pressure of
the concrete without springing. If wood, they shall be nominal two (2)
inch planks surfaced on the inside and the top; or if of metal, they
shall be of approved section. Forms shall have a depth equal to the
depth of the concrete, and shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled
before concrete is placed against them. Forms that are worn, bent, or
damaged shall not be used.
D. Joints.
(1) Contraction joints shall be spaced in uniform lengths
or sections of five (5) feet. Contraction joints may be either
hand-formed or sawed joints. They shall be done as soon as
practicable after the concrete has set sufficiently to preclude
raveling during the sawing and before any shrinkage cracking
occurs in the concrete. The saw cut depth may be decreased at
the edge adjacent to a curb or structure to obtain a maximum
depth that will avoid damage to them.
(2) Construction joints shall have tooled edges. The
one-quarter (1/4) inch premoulded expansion joint material shall
be cut to conform to the cross sectional area and be placed at
structures and at the end of a day's work. The joints shall be
sealed.
(3) Where existing light standards, poles, fire hydrants,
and similar structures are within the limits of the sidewalk
area, the concrete around such structures shall be scored in a
block eight (8) inches wider than the maximum dimension of the
structure at the sidewalk elevation. Prior to placing the
concrete around such structures, premoulded expansion joint
filler, one-quarter (1/4) of an inch in thickness, shall be
placed around the structure for the full depth of the concrete in
the sidewalk.
E. Placing Concrete. The concrete shall be proportioned, mixed
- 399 -
(22, §309(3), cont'd) (22, §309(3) , cont'd)
and placed. The concrete shall be four (4) inches in depth unless
otherwise indicated on the drawings or specified. The concrete shall
be struck off, finished, and tested. Unless otherwise directed an
edger having a one-quarter (1/4) inch radius shall be used for edging
all joints. The concrete shall be cured and protected.
F. Removal of Forms. Side forms shall not be removed within
twelve (12) hours after the concrete has been placed. After removal
of the forms, minor honeycombed areas shall be filled with mortar
composed of one (1) part of cement and two (2) parts of fine
aggregate. Major honeycombed areas will be considered as defective
work, and shall be removed and replaced at no expense to the Borough.
G. Backfilling. After the concrete has cured for a period of
not less than seventy-two (72) hours, the spaces adjacent to the
sidewalk shall be backfilled with approved material in layers of not
more than four (4) inches in depth, which shall be thoroughly
compacted mechanically to the required elevation and cross section.

(24, §205(2)) (24, §205(2))
2. Exemption Procedure.
A. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services
tax may annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with
the person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the
Borough of less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) in the tax
year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the
Borough utilizes a tax collection officer, the Borough shall provide a
copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption
certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last
pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year
prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be
exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and
until otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as required by the
following paragraph .B, the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the tax year or the remainder of the tax year for which
the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all
times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form
provided by the Borough.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
tax year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person
or by the Borough that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of
twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) in that tax year or that the person
is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that tax year, or upon
an employer’s payment to the person of earned income within the
political subdivision in an amount equal to or in excess of twelve
thousand dollars ($12,000.00) in that tax year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person under the following
paragraph .C.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given tax year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the tax year under the above
paragraph .B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of
that tax year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the
first payroll period after receipt of the notification under the above
paragraph .B, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person
under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first
payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the
remaining payroll periods in that tax year shall be the same amount
withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this paragraph is subsequently
severed in that tax year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue collection under this
Part.
D. Except as provided in the above subparagraph .B, it is the
intent of this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for
investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility,
or exempting any employee from the local services tax.

(24, §205(3)) (24, §205(3))
3. Refunds. The Borough, in consultation with the collector and DCED,
shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax
paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within seventy-five
(75) days of a refund request or seventy-five (75) days after the last day
the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the tax
year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall
be made for amounts overpaid in a tax year that do not exceed one dollar
($1.00). The Borough or the collector shall determine eligibility for
exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§206. Duties of Employers.
1. Each employer within the Borough, as well as those employers
situated outside the Borough but who engage in business within the Borough,
is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his
employees engaged by him or performing for him within the Borough, and making
and filing a return and payment of the local service taxes to the collector.
Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each
employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage,
or commission, and whether or not all such services are performed within the
Borough.
2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for
a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied
for the tax year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the tax year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100) of a dollar. Collection of the tax
shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the
person is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection .4 of
this Section. For purposes of this subsection, “combined rate” shall mean
the aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the
political subdivision.
3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax
by more than one (1) political subdivision during each payroll period.
4. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain
from withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from
a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of
the payroll period, and the amount of the tax withheld; and a statement from
the employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer
and the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place
of employment within two (2) weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s
statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED or the Borough.
5. The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each
person for each tax year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions
within which a person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a
taxpayer with a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
- 456 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(24, §206(6)) (24, §206(6))
6. No employer shall he held liable for failure to withhold the tax
or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s principal
office, or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with
the provisions of §205.2 of this Part and this Section, and remits the amount
so withheld in accordance with this Part.
7. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes
thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter of a tax year.
(Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§207. Tax Returns. Each employer shall prepare and file a return
showing a computation of the tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by
the collector. If an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax,
whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages,
or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided
hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of
the tax in full as though the tax had been originally levied against the
employer. (Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§208. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment. In each tax
year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to determine the
number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
collector on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year. (Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§209. Self-employed Individuals. Each self-employed individual who
performs services of any type or kind, or engages in any occupation or
profession, within a primary place of employment within the political
subdivision shall be required to comply with this Part and pay the pro rata
portion of the tax due to the collector on or before the thirtieth (30th) day
following the end of each quarter. (Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§210. Individuals Engaged in More than One (1) Occupation or Employed
in More than One (1) Political Subdivision. The situs of the tax shall be
the place of employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the
tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more
than one (1) occupation, that is, concurrent employment or an occupation that
requires the person working in more than one (1) political subdivision during
a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax
shall be in the following order:
A. First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains
his or her principal office or is principally employed.
B. Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides
and works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
C. Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed
and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
Page Revised 7/1/2014 - 457 -
(24, §210, cont’d) (24, §210, cont’d)
In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that tax
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima
facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§211. Nonresidents Subject to Tax. All employers and self-employed
individuals residing or having their places of business outside of the
Borough but who perform services of any type or kind, or engage in any
occupation or profession within the Borough, do by virtue thereof agree to be
bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties, and regulations
promulgated under this Part with the same force and effect as though they
were residents of the Borough. Further, any individual engaged in an
occupation within the Borough and an employee of a nonresidential employer
may, for the purpose of this Part, be considered a self-employed person, and
in the event his or her tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided. (Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§212. Administration of Tax.
1. The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough. It
shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive payments of this tax
and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from each
employer of self-employed person, together with the date the tax was
received.
2. The collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt, and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of
this Part, including without limitation provisions for the examination of
payroll records of any employer subject to this Part, the examination and
correction of any return made in compliance with this Part, and any payment
alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or
found to have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
collector shall have the right to appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers
Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998, and in accordance with any other
procedures established by the Borough.
3. The collector and Borough are each authorized to examine the books
and payroll records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any
return made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the collector or
the Borough, whichever requests same, the means, facilities, and opportunity
for such examination.
(Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§213. Suits for Collection.
1. In the event that any tax under this Part remains due or unpaid
thirty (30) days after the due dates above set forth, the collector may sue
for the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this Part, together with
interest and penalty.
- 458 - Page Revised 7/1/2014
(24, §213(2)) (24, §213(2))
2. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the
rate of six (6) percent on the amount of such tax shall be calculated
beginning with the due date of the tax, and a penalty of five (5) percent
shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. When
suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other appropriate remedy
undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be responsible
and liable for the costs of collection.
3. The remedies described in this Part for the recovery and collection
of the tax shall be in addition to and concurrent with any and all other
remedies available to the Borough or the collector for such purposes.
(Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§214. Violations and Penalties. Whoever makes any false or untrue
statement on any return required by this Part, or whoever refuses inspection
of the books, records, or accounts in his or her custody and control setting
forth the number of employees subject to this tax who are in his or her
employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file any return required by this
Part shall be guilty of a violation and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
sentenced to pay a fine of not more than six hundred dollars ($600.00) and
costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment of not more than thirty (30) days. The action to enforce the
penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of
the business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to file a
return required by this Part. (Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§215. Interpretation.
1. Nothing contained in this Part shall he construed to empower the
Borough to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not
within the taxing power of the Borough under the Constitution of the United
States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
2. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this Part shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax
so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.
(Ord. 526, 2/6/2007, §1)
§216. Effective Date. The tax imposed by this Part shall be effective
on January 1, 2008, for 2008 and all calendar years thereafter. ( Ord. 526,

Part 3
Tax Certification
§301. Legislative Findings. It is customary in Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania, for the Tax Collector to provide certifications to real
estate settlement agents regarding real estate taxes for premises being
conveyed. Due to the time involved in the providing of such information,
and the lack of any legal requirements for the Tax Collector to perform
such a service, Council for the Borough of New Holland deems it appropriate
to permit the Tax Collector to assess a charge for the providing of such
tax certifications. The assessment of such a charge without authorization
by ordinance would constitute a violation of the State Ethics Act. Council
for the Borough of New Holland therefore deems it necessary and appropriate
to enact an ordinance authorizing the Tax Collector to assess a fee for the
providing of tax certifications. (Ord. 416, 3/3/1992, §1)
§302. Tax Certifications; Fee.
1. The Tax Collector for the Borough of New Holland shall, upon
request, furnish information regarding taxes paid, or taxes assessed and
remaining unpaid, on all real estate within the Borough of New Holland.
2. The Tax Collector shall be entitled to receive a fee in the amount
as established from time to time by resolution of Borough Council for each
tax certification provided. [Ord. 427]

(Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§503. Imposition of Tax.
1. General Purpose Resident Tax. The taxing authority hereby imposes
a tax for general revenue purposes at the rate of one (1) percent on earned
income and net profits of individual residents of the taxing authority.
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 470.3 -
(24, §503(2)) (24, §503(2))
2. General Purpose Municipal Nonresident Tax. The taxing authority
also imposes a tax for general revenue purposes at the rate of one (1)
percent on earned income and net profits derived by an individual who is not
a resident of the taxing authority from any work, business, profession, or
activity, of any kind engaged in within the boundaries of the taxing
authority.
3. Ongoing Tax. The tax shall continue at the above rates during the
current tax year and each tax year thereafter, without annual re-enactment,
until this enactment is repealed or the rate is changed.
4. Combined Tax Rate Applicable to Residents. Currently, the total
rate applicable to residents of the taxing authority, including the tax
imposed by the school district and municipality in which the individual
resides, is one (1) percent. This combined tax rate is included solely for
the purpose of providing information applicable on the date of adoption of
this resolution. This combined tax rate might change if the school district
changes the tax rate imposed by the school district.
5. Municipal Tax Rate Applicable to Nonresidents. Currently, the
total rate applicable to nonresidents working within the taxing authority
based on the municipal nonresident tax rate is one (1) percent.
6. Local Tax Enabling Act Applicable. The tax is imposed under
authority of the Local Tax Enabling Act, and all provisions thereof that
relate to a tax on earned income or net profits are incorporated into this
enactment. Any future amendments to the Local Tax Enabling Act that are
required to be applied to a tax on earned income or net profits will
automatically become part of this enactment upon the effective date of such
amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this enactment, to the
maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1937.
7. Applicable Laws, Regulations, Policies, and Procedures. The tax
shall be collected and administered in accordance with all: (A) applicable
laws, rules, and regulations; and (B) regulations, policies, and procedures
adopted by the TCC or by the collector. This includes any regulations,
policies, and procedures adopted in the future to the maximum extent allowed
by 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1937.
(Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§504. Exemptions from Tax; Individuals under Age Sixteen (16). This
governing body finds that: (A) minors of various age groups have traditionally,
and with judicial sanction, been considered as comprising separate
classes for many legislative purposes; and (B) minors under the age of
sixteen (16) are generally unemancipated and subject to compulsory school
attendance and child labor laws and, therefore, have limited earned income
and net profits and control of money such that enforcement of reporting and
collection of tax hereunder against them would yield inconsequential amounts
and be unduly difficult, expensive, and not in the public interest. For
these reasons, individuals under the age of sixteen (16) years are exempt
from liability for the tax. (Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§505. Exemption from Municipal Nonresident Tax; Residents of Other
States If Similar Exemption in Other State. Individuals who are residents of
a State other than Pennsylvania are exempt from liability for the tax, but
only if all local governments of the locality where the individual resides
- 470.4 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(24, §505, cont’d) (24, §505, cont’d)
either: (A) impose no tax on the income of a Pennsylvania resident derived
from activities within the locality; or (B) exempt that income from tax. In
addition to this exemption from municipal nonresident tax, certain credits
and deductions against the tax are permitted under certain circumstances as
provided in applicable law and regulations. (Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§506. Individual Tax Returns and Payments. Every individual receiving
earned income or earning net profits in any tax year shall file tax returns
and pay tax in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act. (Ord. 549,
10/4/2011, §1)
§507. Employer Withholding, Remittance, and Tax Returns. Every
employer shall register, withhold, and remit tax, and file tax returns, in
accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act. (Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§508. Tax Collector. The tax will be collected from individuals and
employers by the collector. (Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§509. Interest, Penalties, Costs, and Fines. Individuals and employers
are subject to interest, penalties, costs, and fines in accordance with the
Local Tax Enabling Act, including costs imposed by the collector in
accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act. (Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §1)
§510. Purpose/Amendment and Restatement/Repeal. The primary purpose
of this enactment is to conform the earned income and net profits tax
currently imposed pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended and
restated by Act 32 of 2008, and to do so within the time frame required by
Act 32. Any prior enactment imposing a tax on earned income or net profits
of individuals is amended and restated in its entirety to read as stated in
this enactment. Any other prior enactment or part of any prior enactment
conflicting with the provisions of this enactment is rescinded insofar as the
conflict exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in force immediately
prior to adoption of this enactment, the provisions of this enactment
are intended as a continuation of such prior enactment and not as a new
enactment. If this enactment is declared invalid, any prior enactment
levying a similar tax shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be
affected by adoption of this enactment. If any part of this enactment is
declared invalid, the similar part of any prior enactment levying a similar
tax shall remain in effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this
enactment. The provisions of this enactment shall not affect any act done or
liability incurred, nor shall such provisions affect any suit or prosecution
pending or to be initiated to enforce any right or penalty or to punish
offense under the authority of any enactment in force prior to adoption of
this enactment. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, this
enactment shall amend and restate on the effective date any enactment levying
a tax on earned income or net profits in force immediately prior to the
effective date. (Ord. 549, 10/4/2011, §4)

§508. Backflow Prevention Devices.
1. Section 109.709 of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources (DER) Rules and Regulations (25 Pa. Code, Chapter 109) requires
that "the public water supplier shall develop and implement a comprehensive
control program for the elimination of existing cross-connections, or the
effective containment of sources of contamination, and prevention of future
cross-connections." The requirements for the cross-connection control
program are defined in the DER Public Water Supply Manual, Part VII, and are
supplemented herein for the Borough water system. Pertinent sections of the
DER Public Water Supply Manual, Part VII, are shown in Appendix A.
2. The Borough reserves the right to require that all permanent and
temporary water service connections to the Borough water system, regardless
of size, including residential service connections and fire service
connections, be equipped with a backflow prevention device. All such
devices, including those installed on three-quarter (3/4) inch diameter
residential service lines, shall be furnished by the consumer or owner. All
backflow prevention devices shall be the property of the consumer or owner,
as the case may be, who shall remain responsible for their installation,
inspection, testing and overhaul in accordance with Borough requirements.
3. No water service connection shall be installed or maintained to any
premises where actual or potential cross-connections between the Borough
system and any other source of water supply may exist.
4. When, in the opinion of the Borough or its authorized representative,
an approved backflow prevention device is required, the consumer shall
furnish and install such approved backflow prevention device at each service
(26, §508(4), cont'd) (26, §508(4), cont'd)
connection to the premises. The backflow prevention device shall be
installed at a location and in a manner approved by the Borough and shall be
installed by a properly qualified person. The device shall be located on the
consumer's side of the water meter, prior to any other branch piping to the
consumer's premises. However, a reduced pressure backflow prevention device
shall not be permitted in the meter pit, but shall be installed in the
building or above the meter pit in a location where it will not be subject to
flooding and will be maintained free from standing water.
5. The type of backflow protection device required for a particular
consumer shall be determined by the Borough based on then-current regulatory
requirements. An approved air gap separation shall be installed where there
are substances that are dangerous to public health. An approved air gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure zone device (RPZD) shall be
installed where the Borough's water system may be contaminated with a
substance that could cause a water system or health hazard. An approved air
gap separation, or an approved RPZD, or an approved double-check valve
assembly (DCVA) shall be installed where the Borough water system may be
polluted with substances that would be objectionable but not dangerous to
health. Portions of the DER Public Water Supply Manual, Part VII, are shown
in Appendix A, which provides backflow prevention device information.
6. Costs of furnishing and installing any backflow prevention device
shall be borne by the consumer, who also retains ownership of the device and
is responsible for testing and maintaining it. Devices shall be inspected,
tested and overhauled at the consumer's expense in accordance with the
following schedule:
A. An air gap separation shall be inspected at the time of
installation and at least every twelve (12) months thereafter.
B. Double-check valve assemblies shall be inspected and tested for
tightness at the time of installation and at least every twelve (12)
months thereafter. They shall be dismantled, inspected internally,
cleaned and repaired whenever needed, and at least every thirty (30)
months.
C. Reduced pressure zone backflow prevention devices shall be
inspected and tested for tightness at the time of installation and at
least every twelve (12) months thereafter. They shall be dismantled,
inspected internally, cleaned and repaired whenever needed, and at least
every five (5) years.
Inspections, testing, and overhaul shall be performed by a person certified
for that work, and repair or replacement shall be made without delay at the
consumer's expense. The consumer shall maintain a complete record of each
backflow prevention device, and a record of inspections, tests, repairs and
overhauls shall be submitted to the Borough upon request.
7. The consumer shall be responsible for conducting periodic surveys
of water use practices on the premises to determine whether there are actual
or potential cross-connections through which contaminants or pollutants could
backflow into the Borough's water system, and the consumer shall furnish such
water use information to the Borough on request. The consumer's premises
- 493 -
(26, §508(7), cont'd) (26, §508(7), cont'd)
shall be open at all reasonable times to the Borough or its authorized
representatives on request to conduct surveys and investigations related to
water use practices and actual or potential cross-connections. Should a
cross-connection be identified, water service from the Borough will be
discontinued until the cross-connection is eliminated. Water service from
the Borough system will be resumed only after the consumer's water lines have
been disinfected and tested following DER requirements at the cost of the
consumer.
8. Where a booster pump has been installed on the service line to or
within any premises, such pump shall be equipped with a low pressure cut-off
device designed to shut off the booster pump when the pump suction pressure
drops to ten (10) pounds per square inch gauge or less for a period of thirty
(30) seconds or longer. The consumer shall maintain the low pressure cut-off
device in proper working order and certify to the Borough, at least once a
year, that the device is operating properly.
9. The Borough may deny or discontinue, after reasonable notice to the
occupants thereof, water service to any premises wherein any backflow
prevention device is not installed, tested and maintained as required; or if
the backflow prevention device has been removed or by-passed; or if a crossconnection
exists on the premises; or if a low pressure cut-off device is not
installed and maintained in working order. Water service to such premises
shall not be restored until the consumer has corrected or eliminated such
conditions or defects to the satisfaction of the Borough.
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§509. Standby Service
1. Any consumer desiring standby water service shall submit an
application for water connection permit to the Borough.
2. The Borough will determine the size and location of service lines
and the number and type(s) of meter(s) required for standby service based on
information supplied by the applicant.
3. Facilities deemed necessary by the Borough to provide standby
service and to protect the Borough's water system shall be installed at the
consumer's expense.
4. All normal water service charges shall apply unless waived by the
Borough.
5. The terms of the standby service shall be as agreed upon by the
Borough and the applicant.

1. In the event that any leakage, waste of water or unnecessary flow
of water comes to the knowledge of or is reported to the Water Superintendent,
he (or she) shall immediately correct the condition causing the
leakage, waste or unnecessary flow. If said leakage, waste or unnecessary
flow is in a private system and is caused by a willful or negligent act of a
person, or by a defect in the private system, and the consumer or owner of
the private system refuses to make immediate repairs, the Water Superintendent
may shut off the water and discontinue the service to said consumer
until the defect is remedied. In the event that the leakage, waste or
unnecessary flow occurs in the Borough's water system, the Water Superintendent
shall take all necessary steps in order to efficiently and in a
workmanlike manner repair and correct the condition.
2. The Borough is not liable for damage resulting from leaks, broken
pipes or any other causes, occurring to or within any house or building, or
between the curb stop and the meter. It is expressly stipulated by and
between the Borough and the consumer that no claims shall be made against
the Borough on account of the bursting or breaking of any main, service pipe
or water system appurtenance attached to the water system.
3. All metered consumption will be billed according to the schedule of
water rates, and no adjustment will be made for excessive consumption due to
leakage or waste.

responsibility whatsoever as insurers of property or person, nor in regard to
any damage or injury to any person or property by reason of any fire,
flooding or water service failure of any type, or any other cause associated
with the Borough's provision of water service. No consumer is entitled to
any service capability (flow, pressure, etc.) except that which is available
at the time of service. The manner in which Borough-furnished information is
interpreted and/or used by the applicant or consumer is the sole responsibility
of the applicant or consumer.
6. The applicant and/or consumer may request that the Borough provide
a determination of estimated fire service capability. Such a determination
will be provided by the Borough, at the Borough's discretion, if requested,
after proper application for water connection permit is made, and the
appropriate fee is paid.
7. All aspects of the design, installation, operation and maintenance
of the applicant's fire service protection system shall comply with all
requirements of the Borough. The Borough reserves the right to require the
applicant and/or consumer to provide it with detailed information on its fire
service protection system and also reserves the right to inspect the
installed system. The Borough further reserves the right to deny or
terminate private fire service if the system is not in compliance with said
specifications.
8. When an applicant desires both private fire service and domestic
water service to a certain premises, the Borough prefers that such service be

requirements. All backflow prevention devices shall be the property of the
consumer who shall be fully responsible for all costs associated with their
proper installation, operation, and maintenance. The Borough reserves the
right to require that consumers appropriately test and maintain said backflow
prevention devices. Failure to comply with Borough stipulations in this
regard shall be grounds for termination of private fire service.
(26, §702(11)) (26, §702(11))
11. All watch meters (bypass meters) installed on private fire service
lines shall become the property of the Borough. The Borough reserves the
right to charge the consumer for metered consumption through such watch
meters in accordance with its schedule of water rates.
12. With the exception of the watch meters (bypass meters), all fire
service meters, including detector check assemblies, shall be the property of
the consumer, who shall be solely responsible for all costs associated with
their installation, testing, repair, maintenance, etc. The Borough reserves
the right to require consumer actions in that regard, and failure to comply
shall constitute grounds for termination of private fire service.
13. No cross connection of any type shall be permitted between any pipe
served through a private fire service line and any pipe served through a
domestic water service line. If determined to exist, all such cross
connections shall be immediately disassembled. Failure to disassemble such
cross connections shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of
private fire service and/or domestic water service.
14. No cross connection shall be made between a pipe served from the
Borough's private fire service connection and any other source of water
supply, such as a consumer well supply. If determined to exist, all such
connections shall be immediately disassembled. If not disassembled, such
cross connections shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of
private fire service by the Borough.
15. Private fire service lines are not to be used for water service,
except for actual fire service emergencies or for testing of fire protection
service systems. Unauthorized use of fire service lines shall constitute
grounds for the Borough's termination of private fire service, and the
consumer shall be liable for estimated quantities of unauthorized water use.
16. In addition to rendering charges for metered consumption through
fire service line meters, the Borough reserves the right to impose flat rates

water connection permit for Borough approval.
2. The Borough shall determine whether a main extension is required in
order to extend water service.
3. Main extensions shall consist of any new main, including mains lying
wholly within a new development or tract of land.
4. When an applicant requests water service that requires a main
extension, as determined by the Borough, the policies stated hereinbelow
shall apply, and the applicant shall submit a main extension application and
shall enter into a main extension agreement with the Borough.
5. All costs associated with a main extension project, including legal,
engineering, construction, inspection and administrative costs, shall be
borne by the applicant. The Borough shall not be obligated to grant refunds,
other than unexpended deposits, although it reserves the right to do so.
6. All main extension plans shall be reviewed or prepared by the
Borough at the applicant's expense, as detailed below.
7. Mains shall be sized by the Borough to meet the applicant's needs,
except that a minimum main size of eight (8) inch diameter is required in the
system.
8. Where a main size is increased by the Borough beyond the size
required to serve the applicant's needs, the additional cost thereof shall be
borne by the Borough.
9. All main extensions shall be constructed in public rights-of-way or
Borough-owned easements. The applicant shall grant to the Borough any
easements across his (or her) property that are necessary for the main

(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§902. Procedure for Main Extensions Constructed by the Applicant.
1. In addition to a main extension application, an applicant is
required to submit to the Borough a plan, or plans, showing in detail the
locations of all proposed water mains and appurtenances for the main
extension. The Borough shall determine, upon reviewing the application,
whether to accept or reject the application, and shall notify the applicant
of its decision.
2. If the Borough accepts the application for a main extension, the
Borough will furnish the applicant an estimate of initial engineering and
administrative costs associated with the engineering review of the
applicant's plans.
3. If the applicant accepts the estimate of initial engineering and
administrative costs, he (or she) shall be required to deposit with the
Borough a sum of money equal to that estimate and execute a main extension
agreement with the Borough. After the main extension agreement is executed
and the deposit received, the Borough or its agent will review the
applicant's plans and recommend any changes required to conform to the
Borough's policies. The plan review is a service to the applicant, and the
review is not intended to detail all the requirements with which the
applicant must comply under the rules and regulations and materials
specifications of the Authority. Final payment by the applicant for initial
engineering and administrative costs shall be based on the actual costs
incurred.
4. After the applicant's main extension application and related water
plans are approved by the Borough, the Borough will submit to the applicant
an estimate of the inspection and administrative costs associated with
construction of the main extension.
5. If the applicant accepts the Borough's estimate of the inspection
and administrative costs, the applicant shall deposit with the Borough a sum
of money equal to the estimated inspection and administrative costs. After
receipt of this deposit, the Borough will permit the applicant to proceed
with construction of the main extension.
6. After completion of the main extension, the Borough will furnish the
applicant a tabulation of the actual inspection and administrative costs
incurred during construction. If the inspection and administrative costs are
less than the deposit of the applicant, the Borough will return to the
Applicant any excess monies deposited. If the inspection and administrative
costs exceed the funds deposited, the applicant will be required to pay the
excess amount to the Borough prior to the receipt of water service.
7. The applicant shall pay to the Borough an amount equal to the
Borough's cost of preparing "as-built" drawings and notes to reference all
(26, §902(7), cont'd) (26, §902(7), cont'd)
valves, corporations, curb stops and fittings to nearby structures prior to
receipt of water service.
8. Ownership of water mains and appurtenances comprising the main
extension shall be transferred to the Borough, with all associated easements
and rights-of-way. A one (1) year maintenance period shall commence upon
acceptance by the Borough of said mains, appurtenances, easements and rightsof-
way.
(Ord. 427, 12/28/1993)
§903. Procedure for Main Extensions Constructed by the Borough.
1. In addition to a main extension application, the applicant shall
submit a plan, or plans, showing in detail the locations of all proposed
residential or commercial units. The Borough will determine, upon reviewing
the application and plan, whether to accept or reject the application, and
will notify the applicant of its decision.
2. If the Borough accepts the main extension application, the Borough
will furnish the applicant an estimate of initial engineering and administrative
costs associated with the preparation of plans, specifications, contract
documents and related costs.
3. If the applicant accepts the initial engineering and administrative
costs, he (or she) shall deposit the estimate of initial engineering and
administrative costs with the Borough and shall execute a main extension
agreement. Subsequently, the Borough will prepare plans, specifications and
contract documents for receiving bids on the main extension. Final payment
by the applicant for initial engineering and administrative costs shall be
based on the actual costs incurred.
4. Sealed proposals for the main extension construction will be
received, publicly opened and tabulated by the Borough. The applicant may
submit a bid proposal. The Borough will select the main extension contractor.
5. The Borough will submit the tabulation of bid proposals to the
applicant, including the estimated total construction cost and the selected
contractor.
6. If the applicant accepts the estimated construction cost and desires
to proceed with the main extension construction, the applicant shall deposit
a sum of money equal to the estimated total construction cost, plus costs for
permits, inspection, administration and other related costs with the Borough.
After receipt of this deposit, the Borough will proceed with the main
extension construction.
7. After completion of the main extension construction, the Borough
will prepare a tabulation of the main extension costs and will submit it to
the applicant. If the total cost is less than the applicant's deposit, the
Borough will return any excess monies deposited. If the total cost exceeds
the applicant's deposit, the applicant shall pay the excess amount prior to
receipt of water service.

PART VII
CHAPTER 1 -DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this Part, the following words shall have the meaning indicated unless clearly indicated
otherwise in the text:
A. Air Gap Separation—means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying potable water to a tank, plumbing
fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the receptacle. The differential distance
shall be at least double the diameter (2 x D) of the supply pipe measured vertically, above
the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case, shall the air gap be less than one (1) inch.
B. Approved—means that a backflow prevention device or method has been accepted by the
public water supplier as suitable for the proposed use.
C. Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker—The term "atmospheric vacuum breaker" (also known as the
non-pressure type vacuum breaker) shall mean a device containing a shut-off valve followed
by a valve body containing a float-check, a check seat and an air inlet port. When the shutoff
valve is open, the flow of water causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the shutoff
valve is closed, the float falls and forms a check valve against back siphonage and at
the same time opens the air inlet port.
D. Auxiliary Water System—Means any water source or system on the premises of or available
to the customer except connections to other approved community water supply systems.
E. Backflow—Means a flow condition, induced by a differential in pressure, that causes the flow
of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases or other substances into the distribution
pipes of a potable water supply system from a source other than its intended source.
F. Backflow Preventer —A device or other means which will prevent the backflow of water or
liquids of questionable quality into the public water supply system.
G. Backsiphonage— Means the backflow of water or mixture of water and other liquids, gases
or other substances from a plumbing fixture or other customer source, into a public water
supply system main due to a temporary negative or sub-atmospheric pressure within the public
water supply system.
H. Consumer—means the owner or person in control of any premises supplied by or in any manner
connected to a public water supply system.
I. Consumer's Water System—means any water system, located on the consumer's premises,
supplied by or in any manner connected to a public water supply system. A household plumbing
system is considered to be a consumer's water system.
J. Containment—Means cross-connection control which isolates the customer's entire facility
from the public water supply system so as to provide the protection necessary to prevent
contamination of the public water supply in the event of backflow from the customer's facility.
K. Contamination—Means the degradation of the quality of the drinking water by wastewaters,
processed fluids, or any water of a quality less than accepted drinking water quality to a degree
which would create an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the
spread of disease.
L. Cross-connection—An arrangement allowing either a direct or indirect connection through
which backflow, including backsiphonage, can occur between the drinking water in a public
water system and a system containing a source or potential source of contamination.
M. Degree of Hazard—Means an evaluation of the potential risk to health and the adverse effect
upon the public water supply system.
- 527 -
N. Double Check Valve Assembly—Means an assembly composed of two single, independently
acting, check valves including tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the
assembly and suitable connections for testing the water tightness of each check valve.
0. Health Hazard—means any condition, device, or practice in a water system or its operation
that creates, or may create, a danger to the health and well being of its users. The word
"severe" as used to qualify "health hazard" means a hazard to the health of the user that
could reasonably be expected to result in the significant morbidity or death.
P. Interchangeable Connection—Means an arrangement or device that will allow alternate but

CHAPTER 3-RECOMMENDED CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL
AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES
3.0General
In selecting for use the devices outlined in this section, it is vital that the degree of protection
provided be commensurate with the degree of hazard present. It is also important that the
limitations of each device beunderstood since the degree of protection provided will depend
on the type of backflow prevention device and the maintenance program employed.
Acceptable backflow prevention devices used for cross-connection control are as follows:
(a) Air Gap
(b) Reduced Pressure Zone Devices'
(c) Double Check Valve Assembly'
• RPZD's and DCVA's should conform to AWWA Standard C506
3.1Air Gap
An air gap separation provides a complete physical separation between the free flowing
discharge end of a potable water supply line, faucet, plumbing fixture, or other device and
the flood level rim of an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An acceptable air-gap separation
shall be at least double the diameter of the supply line. In no case shall the air gap be
less than 1- inch. See Figure VII-1.
Advantages:
Properly designed and installed air gap installations provide the maximum degree of
protection against backflow.
Limitations:
Air gap separations can be defeated by the thoughtless addition of a hose that in effect
extends the discharge end of the pipe to a point below the highest possible water
level of the fixture.
Under some conditions the cost of an air gap separation may be high when compared
to a mechanical backflow prevention device.
Air gap separation usually deprives the water consumer of the use of the water
pressure in the main.
3.2 Reduced Pressure Zone Devices (RPZD)
These devices consist of two spring loaded check valves operating in series, and a spring
loaded diaphragm activated differential pressure relief valve, located in the zone between the
check valves. See Figure V11-2. Two (2) tightly closing shutoff valves and four (4) test cocks
complete the assembly. These devices will indicate leakage through one or both check valves
or the relief valve by the discharge of water from the relief valve port. This factor is an important
advantage over the double check valve assembly.
Advantages:
The RPZD's, when periodically tested and properly maintained, may be used for
backflow protection in situations where it would be extremely difficult to provide an
air gap separation between two systems.

of spout opening a distance greater than three times the diameter of the effective opening
for a single wall, or a distance greater than four times the diameter of the effective opening
for two intersecting walls.
Vertical walls, ribs, or similar obstructions extending from the water surface to or above the
horizontal plane of the spout opening require a greater air gap when spaced closer to the nearest
inside edge of spout opening than specified in (•) above. The effect of three or more such
vertical walls or ribs has not been determined. In such cases, the air gap shall be measured
from the top of the wall.
0 •
- 532 -
Malfunctioning of the RPZD's is indicated by discharge of water from the relief port.
RPZD's provide protection from backflow due to both back-pressure or
back-siphonage.
Limitations:
RPZD's are mechanical devices that require periodic testing and maintenance.
Pressure loss through RPZD's may be expected to average between 10 and 30 psi,
depending upon the size and flow rate of the device.
RPZD's should not be installed below ground level, must be protected from freezing
and provided with adequate space to facilitate maintenance and testing.
3.3 Double Check Valve Assembly (DCVA's)
The DCVA consists of two independently acting check valves mounted in series with two
tightly closing shut-off valves and four test cocks. See Figure V11-3.
Advantages:
The primary advantage of a DCVA is that when its two check valves are in the wide
open position, there is a relative little resistance to flow. The head loss through the
device ranges between 3 and 11 psi, depending on the rate of flow and diameter of
pipe.
DCVA's provide protection against backflow due to both backsiphonage or back
pressure.
The DCVA may be less expensive to install than an air gap or RPZD.
Limitations:
DCVA's have the inherent weakness of possible failure without giving exterior indication
that a failure has occurred.
DCVA's are mechanical devices that require periodic inspection and maintenance.

Part 1
General Provisions
§101. Short Title. This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the
“Borough of New Holland Stormwater Management (SWM) Ordinance.” ( Ord. 568,
5/6/2014, §101)
§102. Statement of Findings. The governing body of the Borough of New
Holland finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows
and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and
safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of SWM, including reasonable regulation
of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection
of the people of the Borough of New Holland and all the people of the
Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which
also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities
to implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) under the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
E. Riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering
pollutants in runoff, providing light control and temperature moderation,
processing pollutants, increasing infiltration and providing
channel and shoreline stability thus decreasing erosion (DEP Riparian
Forest Buffer Guidance, November 27, 2010).
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §102)
§103. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health,
safety, and welfare by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits
described in §102 of this Chapter through provisions designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under State law,
including regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, to protect, maintain,
reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of
this Commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as practicable.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 637 -
(28, §103(E)) (28, §103(E))
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of
surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management best management practices (SWM BMPs) that are implemented
within the Borough of New Holland.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
I. Promote stormwater runoff prevention through the use of
nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
J. Provide a regulatory environment that supports the proportion,
density and intensity of development called for in the comprehensive
plan; allow for creative methods of improving water quality and managing
stormwater runoff; and promote a regional approach to water resource
management.
K. Help preserve and protect exceptional natural resources, and
conserve and restore natural resource systems.
L. Promote stormwater management practices that emphasize
infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration.
M. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams
within the Conestoga River watershed and the Mill Creek watershed.
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §103)
§104. Statutory Authority.
1. Primary Authority. The Borough of New Holland is empowered to
regulate these activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978,
P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. §680.1 et seq., as amended, the “Storm Water
Management Act,” Act 394 of 1937, as amended, 35 P.S. §691.1 et seq., the
Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, the Conestoga River and Mill Creek Act 167
Stormwater Management Plans, the Borough Code and the Flood Plain Management
Act.
2. Secondary Authority. The municipality also is empowered to
regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act
of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended.
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §104)
§105. Applicability.
1. The provisions, regulations, limitations, and restrictions of this
Chapter shall apply to regulated activities, as defined in this Chapter.
2. For any of the activities regulated by this Chapter, the final
approval of subdivision and/or land development plans, the issuance of any
building or occupancy permit, or the commencement of any land disturbance
activity may not proceed until the property owner or developer or his/her
agent has received written approval of a stormwater management site plan from
the Borough or its designee.

(28, §105(3)) (28, §105(3))
3. Any landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development
of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall
implement such measures consistent with this Chapter.
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §105)
§106. Compatibility with Other Ordinance Requirements. Approvals
issued pursuant to this Chapter do not relieve the applicant of the
responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. (Ord. 568,
5/6/2014, §106)
§107. Erroneous Permit. Any permit or authorization issued or approved
based on false, misleading or erroneous information provided by an applicant
is void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work
undertaken or use established pursuant to such permit or other authorization
is unlawful. No action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the
Borough of New Holland purporting to validate such a violation. ( Ord. 568,
5/6/2014, §107)
§108. Municipal Liability. Except as specifically provided by the
Pennsylvania Storm Water Management Act, Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864,
No. 167, as amended, 32 P.S. §680.1 et seq., the making of any administrative
decision by the Borough of New Holland or any of its officials or employees
shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by
the Borough of New Holland of the practicability or safety of any proposed
structure or use with respect to damage from erosion, sedimentation,
stormwater runoff, flood, or any other matter, and shall create no liability
upon or give rise to any cause of action against the Borough of New Holland
and its officials and employees. Borough of New Holland, by enacting and
amending this Chapter, does not waive or limit any immunity granted to the
Borough of New Holland and its officials and employees by the Governmental
Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §8541 et seq., and does not assume any liabilities
or obligations. (Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §108)
§109. Duty of Persons Engaged in the Development of Land. Notwithstanding
any provision(s) of this Chapter, including exemptions, any
landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development of land
which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety, or
other property. Such measures also shall include actions as are required to
manage the rate, volume, direction, and quality of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health, property, and
water quality. (Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §109)
§110. Financial Security.
1. A financial security (bond, restricted account or letter of credit)
for stormwater related improvements shall be supplied by the developer in
conjunction with the subdivision/land development approval, or in conjunction
with the SWM site plan approval if no subdivision/land development plan is
required.
2. The applicant shall provide a financial security to the Borough of
New Holland for the timely installation and proper construction of all SWM
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 639 -
(28, §110(2), cont’d) (28, §110(2), cont’d)
facilities, including E&S BMPS, as required by the approved SWM site plan and
this Chapter and, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of §§509,
510, and 511 of the MPC.
3. As the work of installing the required SWM facilities proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the governing body to
release or authorize the release, from time to time, such portions of the
financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors
performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the
governing body, and the governing body shall have forty-five (45) days from
receipt of such request within which to allow the municipal engineer to
certify, in writing, to the governing body that such portion of the work upon
the SWM facilities has been completed in accordance with the approved SWM
site plan. Upon such certification the governing body shall authorize
release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as
estimated by the municipal engineer fairly representing the value of the SWM

Infiltration BMPs shall include pretreatment BMPs unless shown to be
unnecessary.
14. The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses
(e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery use) and maintain the level of
water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams, and to protect
and maintain water quality in “special protection” streams, as required by
- 658 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(28, §301(14), cont’d) (28, §301(14), cont’d)
the statewide regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93 (collectively referred to

trees exist, only the trees on the outside edge need to be marked. A
forty-eight (48) inch high snow fence or forty-eight (48) inch high
construction fence mounted on steel posts located eight (8) feet on
center shall be placed along the tree protection boundary. No construction,
storage of material, temporary parking, pollution of soil, or

a maintenance note for the stake and/or wire removal within one (1)
year of planting.
18. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase to maintain

[Chapter 27], the New Holland Borough Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance [Chapter 22], any ordinance which regulates construction and
development within areas of the Borough of New Holland subject to flooding,
and any other applicable requirements of the Flood Plain Management Act.
28. The municipality may require additional stormwater control measures
for stormwater discharges to special management areas including, but not
limited to:

- 660 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(28, §301(28)(C), cont’d) (28, §301(28)(C), cont’d)
or other groundwater recharge areas highly vulnerable to contamination,
drainage areas to water supply reservoirs, source water protection
zones, etc.)
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §301)
§302. Volume Controls. Volume control BMPs are intended to maintain
existing hydrologic conditions for small storm events by promoting groundwater
recharge and/or evapotranspiration as described in this Section. Runoff
volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method described
in paragraph .A below, or through continuous modeling approaches or other
means as described in the BMP Manual. Small projects may use the method
described in paragraph .B to design volume control BMPs.
A. The design storm method is applicable to any size of regulated
activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site
conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post development total runoff volume
for all storms equal to or less than the two (2) year twenty-four
(24) hour storm event.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious
areas must be considered meadow in good condition.
(b) When the existing project site contains impervious
area, twenty percent (20%) of existing impervious area to be
disturbed shall be considered meadow in good condition in the
model for existing conditions.
(3) The maximum loading ratio for volume control
facilities in Karst (carbonate geology) areas shall be three
to one (3:1) impervious drainage area to infiltration area and
five to one (5:1) total drainage area to infiltration area.
The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in
non-Karst areas shall be five to one (5:1) impervious drainage
area to infiltration area and eight to one (8:1) total
drainage area to infiltration area. A higher ratio may be
approved by the municipality if justification is provided.
Hydraulic depth may be used as an alternative to an area based
loading ratio if the design hydraulic depth is shown to be
less than the depth that could result from the maximum area
loading ratio.
B. Volume Control for Small Projects.
(1) At least the first one (1) inch of runoff from new
impervious surfaces or an equivalent volume shall be permanently
removed from the runoff flow - i.e., it shall not be released into
the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration and infiltration.
C. A detailed geologic evaluation of the development site shall
be performed in areas of carbonate geology to determine the design
parameters of recharge facilities. A report shall be prepared in
accordance with §405.1 of this Chapter.
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 661 -
(28, §302(D)) (28, §302(D))
D. Storage facilities, including normally dry, open top facilities,
shall completely drain the volume control storage over a period
of time not less than twenty-four (24) hours and not more than seventytwo
(72) hours from the end of the design storm. Any designed infiltration
at such facilities is exempt from the minimum twenty-four (24) hour
standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter period of time, provided
that none of this water will be discharged into waters of this Commonwealth.
E. Any portion of the volume control storage that meets the
following criteria may also be used as rate control storage:
(1) Volume control storage that depends on infiltration is
designed according to the infiltration standards in §301.
(2) The volume control storage which will be used for rate
control is that storage which is available within twenty-four (24)
hours from the end of the design storm based on the stabilized
infiltration rate and/or the evapo-transpiration rate.
F. Volume control storage facilities designed to infiltrate shall
avoid the least permeable hydrologic soil group(s) at the development
site.
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §302)
§303. Rate Controls. Rate control for large storms, up to the one
hundred (100) year event, is essential to protect against immediate
downstream erosion and flooding.
A. Match Pre-existing Hydrograph. Developers and/or landowners
are encouraged to provide infiltration facilities or utilize other
techniques, which will allow the post-development hydrograph to match
the preexisting hydrograph, along all parts of the hydrograph, for the
development site. To match the pre-existing hydrograph means that it
is not to be exceeded at all points in time. This option is most
feasible for small subdivisions in areas of non-carbonate geology.
“Groundwater recharge” and “water quality” volumes as given in paragraphs
.C and .D below can be used as part of this option. State water
quality requirements can be met by BMPs, including site design, which
provide for replication of pre-construction stormwater infiltration and
runoff conditions, so that post-construction stormwater discharges do
not degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. As described in the PADEP Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Policy (#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be
achieved by the following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions.
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff.
(3) Streambank and Streambed Protection: management of volume
and rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring and
erosion).
- 662 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(28, §303(B)) (28, §303(B))
B. Detention/Infiltration Standards (only if existing hydrograph
cannot be matched).
(1) Post-development rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the peak rate of
runoff prior to development for all design storms unless the preexisting
hydrograph is not exceeded at all points in time. The
percentage of the pre-development peak rate, which may be released,
is known as the “release rate.”
(2) When the regulated activity constitutes a subdivision or
land development as defined in the New Holland Borough Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22], the SWM site plan and
subdivision/land development plan shall be processed concurrently
according to the plan processing procedure outlined in the current
New Holland Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22].
(3) Innovative methods for the control of stormwater runoff
are encouraged. Various combinations of methods should be tailored
to suit the particular requirements of the type of development and
the topographic features of the development site. The following
is a partial listing of detention and control methods which can be
utilized in stormwater management systems where appropriate:
(a) Detention basins.
(b) Retention basins (subject to prior municipal
approval).
(c) Permanent pool, ponds, or lakes designed with
detention storage.
(d) Rooftop detention (with proper design of the
building to carry the additional load).
(e) Parking lot storage.
(f) Seepage pits, seepage trenches or other infiltration
structures.
(g) Concrete lattice block surfaces.
(h) Grassed channels and vegetated strips.
(i) Cisterns and underground reservoirs.
(j) Routed flow over grass.
(k) Decreased impervious surface coverage.
(l) Bio-retention areas (rain gardens).
(m) Other methods as may be found in the “Pennsylvania
Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing Areas,”
the “Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual,” or equivalent.
(2) The following principles shall be applied to the erosion
and sediment pollution control plan and construction schedule to
minimize soil erosion and sedimentation:
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 663 -
(28, §303(B), cont’d) (28, §303(B), cont’d)
(a) Stripping of vegetation, grading, or other soil
disturbance shall be done in a manner which will minimize soil
erosion.
(b) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be
retained and protected.
(c) To the maximum extent practicable, mature healthy
trees of at least six (6) inches DBH and other significant
existing vegetation shall be retained and protected. Such
trees shall not be removed except as provided on the approved
subdivision or land development plan. The filling of soil
over the roots of trees to be preserved is prohibited. The
roots are presumed to extend out from the tree as far as the
tree’s branches extend outward.
(d) No earthmoving or stripping of vegetation will be
conducted in areas of greater than thirty-three (33%) slope
unless specific approval is obtained from the Borough.
(e) The extent of the disturbed area and the duration
of its exposure shall be kept to a minimum, within practical
limits. Land disturbance shall be limited to the actual
construction site and an access strip.
(f) The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) has regulations that require an erosion and
sediment control plan for any earth disturbance activity of
five thousand (5,000) square feet for more, under 25 Pa.Code
§102.4(b).
(g) In addition under 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 92, a DEP
“NPDES Construction Activities” permit is required for any
earth disturbance one (1) acre or more with a point source
discharge to surface waters or the municipality’s storm sewer
system, or five acres or more regardless of the planned runoff
(hereinafter collectively referred to as “regulated earth
disturbance activities”). This includes earth disturbance on
any portion of, part of, or during any stage of, a larger
common plan of development.
(h) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated
earth disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional
office or County Conservation District must be provided to the
municipality. The issuance of an NPDES Construction permit
(or permit coverage under the Statewide general permit (PAG-2)
satisfies the requirements paragraph .A.
(i) Either temporary seeding, mulching, temporary
detention basins, diversion terraces, rock filter berms, or
hay bales (in areas of minimum flows) appropriate to the scale
of the operations or other suitable stabilization measures
shall be used to protect exposed critical areas during
construction and whenever a situation is created which would
contribute to increased erosion.
(j) Drainage provisions shall accommodate the stormwater
runoff both during and after construction. The permanent
- 664 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(28, §303(B), cont’d) (28, §303(B), cont’d)
(final) vegetative and structural erosion control and drainage
measures shall be installed as directed by the Borough.
(k) Soil erosion and sedimentation facilities shall be
installed prior to any on-site grading.
(l) Procedures for protecting soils or geologic
structures with water supply potential from contamination by
surface water or other disruption by construction activity
shall be established in consultation with the engineer and
such areas shall include, at minimum, those underlain by
carbonate limestone formations.
(m) All plans for erosion and sedimentation and
stormwater management shall conform to the plan content
requirements of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources’ “Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual.”
(n) All subdivision and land developments are required
to comply with Chapter 102 of the rules and regulations of the
Pennsylvania Clear Streams Law as enacted by the Department
of Environmental Resources.
(o) The developer shall be responsible for submission
of the erosion and sedimentation control plan to the Lancaster
County Conservation District for determination of the plan’s
compliance with Chapter 102. Conservation District approval
of the plan must be made before the Borough will make final
plan approval. On projects disturbing more than twenty-five
(25) acres or land, an earth disturbance permit must be
secured from the Department of Environmental Resources. No
permits from the Borough will be issued or any earthmoving
begun until the earth disturbance permit is issued.
(p) The requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources and/or the Soil Conservation Service,
USDA, shall be met, and evidence of approvals by those
agencies shall be submitted to the Borough.
(q) The erosion and sedimentation control plan must be
available on site at all times and be fully implemented. The
site must be open for inspections by the Department of
Environmental Resources and the Soil Conservation District.
C. Groundwater Recharge.
(1) Developed areas shall maintain groundwater recharge
consistent with predevelopment conditions, dependent on hydrologic
soil groups and impervious cover unless the developer can prove the
inability of the development site to achieve recharge based on
existing development site conditions. This volume of runoff is
termed the “recharge volume” and is calculated in accordance with
§306. The recharge volume must be infiltrated within forty-eight
(48) hours after the end of the design storm. Development sites
where the post developed impervious area is equal to or less than
the pre developed impervious area shall not be required to provide
ground water recharge volume.
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 665 -
(28, §303(C), cont’d) (28, §303(C), cont’d)
(2) Design of the stormwater management facilities shall
provide for ground water recharge to compensate for the reduction
in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface runoff
characteristics have been altered. A detailed geologic evaluation
of the development site shall be performed to determine the
suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a State licensed/certified Professional Geologist, and
shall, at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock,
susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability.
Where pervious pavement is permitted for parking lots, recreational
facilities, non-dedicated streets, or other areas, pavement
construction specifications shall be noted on the plan.
(3) If the developer can prove through analysis that the
development site is in an area underlain by carbonate geology, and
such geologic conditions may result in sinkhole formations, then
the development site is exempt from recharge requirements.
However, the development site shall still be required to meet all
other hydrologic and water quality management standards as found
in this Chapter.
D. Water Quality. Provide adequate storage and treatment
facilities necessary to capture and treat a minimum of the runoff from
the first one and two-tenth (1.2) inches of rainfall for all regulated
activities. This volume of storage is the “water quality volume” and
is calculated in accordance with §306.11. The recharge volume may be
a component of the water quality volume. If the recharge volume is less
than the water quality volume, the remaining water quality volume may
be captured and treated by methods other than recharge/infiltration
BMPs. The water quality volume must take a minimum of twenty-four (24)
hours to be discharged. Development sites where the post developed
impervious area is equal to or less than the pre-developed impervious
area shall not be required to provide water quality volume unless
required by NPDES Part II.
E. Stormwater Conveyance Corridor Protection (Riparian Corridor
Preservation and Vegetation). Runoff from developed areas of the
development site, including, but not limited to, areas of impervious
surface, shall be managed through a series of riparian corridor
vegetation facilities whenever possible. This will be accomplished in
a manner satisfactory to the municipality, utilizing the “Pennsylvania
Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing Areas,” 1998,
riparian forested buffer, and the priority goal of the riparian
vegetation will be the reduction of thermal impacts on stormwater runoff
associated with impervious areas, with a secondary goal being the
protection of capacity of existing stormwater conveyance channels.
These goals will be achieved through the use of design criteria in §304
of this Chapter and shall be in addition to any other municipal
ordinance provisions.
F. Normally dry, open top, storage facilities shall completely
drain the rate control storage over a period of time less than or equal
to twenty-four (24) hours from the peak one hundred (100) year water
surface design elevation.
G. Small projects are not required to provide for rate control.

§304. Design Criteria for Stormwater Management Facilities.
1. Any stormwater management facility designed to store stormwater
runoff and requiring a berm or earth embankment (i.e., detention or retention
basin) shall be designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle the one
hundred (100) year post-development peak flow rate. The height of embankment
must be set to provide at minimum one (1.0) foot of freeboard above the
maximum elevation computed when the entire one hundred (100) year peak flow
passes through the spillway. However, criteria for design and construction
of stormwater management facilities are not the same criteria that are used
in permitting of dams under the PA DEP Dam Safety Program. Depending upon
the physical characteristics of a dam, a dam permit may be required and the
design will have to meet the provisions of Chapter 105. Depending on the
physical characteristics of a dam, the design could require that anywhere
from a one hundred (100) year to a probable maximum flood (PMF) storm event
be considered. The following is required:
A. Retention basins may only be used with specific Borough
approval.
B. Drainage facilities for drainage areas in excess of one-half
(1/2) square mile (three hundred twenty (320) acres) shall conform to
the requirements of, and be approved by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources, Division of Dams and Encroachments.
C. The maximum water depth shall not exceed six (6) feet, unless
approved by a modification granted in conformance with §808 by the
Borough Council upon recommendation of the municipal engineer.
D. The minimum top width of all dams/embankments/berms shall be
five (5) feet.
E. Side slopes shall not be steeper than three (3) horizontal to
one (1) vertical for non-residential sites, and four (4) horizontal to
one (1) vertical for residential sites.
F. All basins shall be structurally sound and shall be constructed
of sound and durable materials. The completed structure and
the foundation of all basins shall be stable under all probably
conditions of operation. An emergency spillway shall be provided for
the basin and shall be capable of discharging the one hundred (100) year
peak rate of runoff which enters the basin after development, in a
manner which will not damage the integrity of the facility and will not
create a downstream hazard. Where practical, the emergency spillway
shall be constructed in undisturbed ground. An easement for inspection
and repair shall be provided when the conveyance structure crosses
property boundaries.
G. All basins not including groundwater recharge and/or water
quality storage shall include an outlet structure to permit draining the
basin to a completely dry position within twenty-four (24) hours
following the end of the design rainfall. All basins that do include
groundwater recharge and/or water quality storage shall include an
outlet structure to permit draining the basin to the level of the
groundwater recharge and/or water quality storage within twenty-four
(24) hours following the end of the design rainfall.
H. A cutoff trench of relatively impervious material shall be
provided within all basin embankments.

discharge pipes) shall be made of reinforced concrete and stainless or
hot dip galvanized steel. Discharge pipes shall conform to the
requirements of subsection .6 below.
K. Low flow channels shall be provided from each water carrying
facility to the outlet structure for all basins that do not include
groundwater recharge and/or water quality storage. Grass low flow
channels shall be two percent (2%) minimum slope and concrete low flow
channels shall be one-half percent (1/2%) minimum, and shall be designed
to enable ease of maintenance. All basins that do not include groundwater
recharge and/or water quality storage shall not be required to have
a low flow channel.
L. Minimum slope within that portion of a basin that does not
include groundwater recharge and/or water quality storage shall be two
percent (2%) positive grade to the low flow channel.
M. Tile fields may be required to aid in draining the bottom of
a basin if swampy and/or unmaintainable conditions are known to exist.
N. Design storms for the computation of detention basin volumes
shall be a duration sufficient to maximize the required volumes, up to
a maximum twenty-four (24) hour storm.

areas shall have childproof, non-clogging trash racks over all design
openings less than eighteen (18) inches in diameter, except those
openings designed to carry perennial stream flows.
Q. The effect on downstream areas if the basin embankment fails
shall be considered in the design of all basins. Where possible, the
basin shall be designed to minimize the potential damage caused by such
failure of the embankment.

those used for Groundwater recharge volume and water quality volume,
must completely drain within twenty-four (24) hours after the end of the
design storm.
S. Soils used for the construction of basins shall have low
erodibility factors (“K” factors).
T. Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed
at points where pipes or drainage ways discharge to or from basins.
Generally, outlet pipes designed to carry the pre-development, two (2)

site is suggested for their construction.
U. Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides of all earthen basins within fifteen
(15) days of initial construction.
V. Notwithstanding the above, all requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources and/or the Soil Conservation
Service, USDA, shall be met, and evidence of approvals by those agencies
shall be submitted to the Borough.
2. Where, in the judgment of the Borough, the quantity of stormwater
runoff will cause detrimental downstream impact, quantity will be a
consideration in the method of stormwater management.
3. Minimum floor elevations for all structures that would be affected
by a basin, other temporary impoundments, or open conveyance systems where
ponding may occur shall be two (2) feet above the one hundred (100) year
water surface. If basement or underground facilities are proposed, detailed
calculations addressing the effects of stormwater ponding on the structure
and waterproofing and/or flood-proofing design information shall be submitted
for approval.
4. All storm sewer pipes, culverts and bridges (excluding detention
and retention basin outfall structures), gutters and swales conveying water

basin underdrains and street subbase underdrains, shall have a minimum
diameter of eighteen (18) inches and be made of reinforced concrete pipe,
smooth lined corrugated polyethylene pipe, or approved equivalent. Where
installation conditions merit, structural calculations that address the
actual design requirements will be required.
7. A five (5) minute storm duration shall be used if this does not
result in a maximum expected discharge that exceeds the capability of thirty
(30) inch pipe. If a five (5) minute storm duration results in a pipe size
exceeding thirty (30) inches, the time of concentration approach shall be
used in determining storm duration.
8. Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots,
at a maximum of six hundred (600) feet apart along a storm sewer pipe or
culvert, at points of abrupt changes in the horizontal or vertical directions

prohibited. Tee joints, elbows and wyes are also prohibited unless used in
an underground stormwater storage facility. Manholes, inlets, headwalls and
endwalls proposed for dedication or located along streets or subject to
vehicular traffic shall conform to the requirements of the Pa DOT, Bureau of
Design, Standards for Roadway Construction, Publication No. 72, in effect at
the time the design is submitted, or as otherwise modified by the municipality.

23. Open ditches per se shall be avoided but properly designed, graded
and turfed drainage swales shall be permitted in lieu of storm sewers in
commercial and industrial areas and, where approved by the Borough, in
residential areas. Such swales shall be designed not only to carry the

shall flow directly into a natural drainageway, watercourse, or into an
existing storm sewer system, or onto adjacent properties in a manner similar
to the runoff characteristics of the pre-development flow.
3. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification of the adjacent property owner(s) by the developer. Such
stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this Chapter,
including the establishment of a drainage easement. Copies of all such
notifications shall be included in SWM site plan submissions.
4. Existing on-site natural and man-made SWM facilities shall be used
to the maximum extent practicable.
5. Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one (1) subwatershed

accepted calculation techniques based on the NRCS soil-cover complex method.
2. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated
using either the modified rational method, a soil-cover-complex methodology,

3. If the SCS method is used, Antecedent Moisture Condition 1 is to
be used in areas of carbonate geology, and Antecedent Moisture Condition 2 is
to be used in all other areas. A type II distribution shall be used in all
areas.
4. If the rational method is used, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 data (see subsection .2 above) or
PennDOT Publication 584 “PennDOT Drainage Manual,” 2008 Edition, or latest,
shall be used to determine the rainfall intensity in inches per hour based on
the information for the 5 through 60 minute duration storm events.
5. Hydrographs may be obtained from NRCS methods such as TR-55, TR20,
or from use of the “modified” or “unit hydrograph” rational methods. If
“modified” or “unit hydrograph” rational methods are used, the ascending leg
of the hydrograph shall have a length equal to three times the time of
concentration (3xTc) and the descending leg shall have a length equal to
seven (7) times the time of concentration (7xTc) to approximate an SCS Type
II hydrograph.11
6. Runoff calculations shall include a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis indicating volume and velocities of flow and the grades, sizes, and
capacities of water carrying structures, sediment basins, retention and
detention structures and sufficient design information to construct such
facilities. Runoff calculations shall also indicate both pre-development and
post-development rates for peak discharge of stormwater runoff from all
discharge points.
7. For the purpose of calculating pre-development peak discharges, all
runoff coefficients, both on-site and off-site, shall be based on actual land
use assuming summer or good land conditions. Post-development runoff
coefficients for off-site discharges used to design conveyance facilities
shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land conditions.
8. Criteria and assumptions to be used in the determination of
stormwater runoff and design of management facilities are as follows:
A. Runoff coefficients shall be based on the information
contained in Appendix B-1 and B-2 if the actual land use is listed in
those Appendices. If the actual land use is not listed in these
Appendices, runoff coefficients shall be chosen from other published
documentation, and a copy of said documentation shall be submitted with
the SWM site plan.
B. A sample worksheet for calculating Tc is provided in Appendix
B-4. Times of concentration (Tc) shall be based on the following design
parameters:
(1) Sheet flow: The maximum length for each reach of sheet
or overland flow before shallow concentrated or open channel flow
develops is one hundred (100) feet. Sheet flow may be determined
using the nomograph in Appendix B-3, or the Manning’s kinematic
solution shown in the Sheet Flow section of Worksheet No. 1 in
Appendix B-4.
(2) Shallow concentrated flow: Travel time for shallow
concentrated flow shall be determined using Figure 3-1 from TR-55,
Urban Hydrology for small watersheds, as shown in Appendix B-5.
- 674 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(28, §306(8)(B), cont’d) (28, §306(8)(B), cont’d)
(3) Open channel flows: At points where sheet and shallow
concentrated flows concentrate in field depressions, swales,
gutters, curbs, or pipe collection systems, the travel times to
downstream end of the development site between these design points
shall be based upon Manning’s equation and/or acceptable engineering
design standards as determined by the municipal engineer.
C. The developer may use stormwater credits for non-structural
BMPs in accordance with the BMP Manual. The allowable reduction will
be determined by the municipality.
D. Peak rate control is not required for off-site runoff. Offsite
runoff may be by-passed around the site provided all other
discharge requirements are met. If offsite runoff is routed through
rate control facilities, runoff coefficients for off-site discharges
used to design those rate control facilities shall be based on actual
land use assuming winter or poor land conditions.
9. Times of concentration shall be calculated based on the methodology
recommended in the respective model used. Times of concentration for channel
and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning’s equation. Supporting
documentation and calculations must be submitted for review and approval.
10. Groundwater Recharge Requirements. The ground water recharge
volume (Rev) is the volume of stormwater runoff from a developed site which
shall be required to maintain existing pre-development groundwater recharge
at development sites. It may be part of the water quality volume, and is
calculated on the basis of treatment and recharge by structural stormwater
management practices as follows:
Rev = [(S)(Rv)(A)]/12
Where,
Rev = Recharge volume in acre-feet
A = Area of watershed in acres
Rv = 0.05+0.9(I), where I = net increase in impervious
area/area of watershed (A)
S = the Soil Specific Recharge factor and varies according
to soil type:
Hydrologic Soil Group Soil Specific Recharge Factor (S)
A 0.40
B 0.26
C 0.13
D 0.07
Each specific recharge factor (S) is based on the USDA average annual
recharge volume per soil type divided by the annual rainfall in
Lancaster County (forty-one (41) inches per year) and multiplied by
ninety percent (90%) (to model a volume which captures ninety percent
(90%) of the runoff). This keeps the recharge volume calculation
consistent with the WQv methodology. The USDA average annual recharge
Page Added 7/1/2014 - 675 -
(28, §306(10), cont’d) (28, §306(10), cont’d)
volume per soil type is eighteen (18) inches for HSG “A,” twelve (12)
inches for HSG “B,” six (6) inches for HSG “C” and three (3) inches for
HSG “D” (Rawls, Brakensiek & Saxton, 1982).
A. If more than one hydrologic soil group (HSG) is present at a
development site, a composite recharge volume shall be computed based
upon the proportion of total increased impervious surface within each
HSG.
B. Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed
areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and development
site conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
(1) A minimum depth of forty-eight (48) inches between the
bottom of the facility and the seasonal high water table and/or
bedrock (limiting zones).
(2) An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to
accept the additional stormwater load and drain completely as
determined by field tests conducted by the owner’s professional
designer.
C. Infiltration BMPs receiving only roof runoff may be placed in
soils having a minimum depth of twenty-four (24) inches between the
bottom of the facility and the limiting zone.
D. The recharge volume provided at the development site shall be
directed to the most permeable HSG available.
E. Structural Stormwater management facilities which provide
treatment and recharge of the required recharge volume will be designed
as part of a stormwater management facility which incorporates groundwater
recharge BMPs as a primary benefit using that facility, in accordance
with the design specifications contained in “Pennsylvania Handbook
of Best Management Practices for Developing Areas,” 1998, or the most
recent version thereof.
F. The groundwater recharge volume shall be infiltrated within
forty-eight (48) hours after the end of the design storm.
G. Development sites where the post developed impervious area is
equal to or less than the pre developed impervious area shall not be
required to provide ground water recharge volume.
11. Calculation of water quality volume: The water quality volume (WQv)
is the storage capacity needed to treat stormwater runoff equivalent to a
minimum of the first one and two tenths (1.2) inches of runoff from the
developed areas of the development site. The following calculation is used
to determine the storage volume, WQv, in acre-feet of storage:
Wqv = [(1.2)(Rv)(A)]/12
Wqv = water quality volume in acre-feet
A = Area of watershed in acres
Rv = 0.05 + 0.9(I), where I = net increase in impervious area/area
of watershed (A)
- 676 - Page Added 7/1/2014
(28, §306(11), cont’d) (28, §306(11), cont’d)
WQv shall be designed as part of a stormwater management facility which
incorporates water quality BMPs as a primary benefit of using that
facility, in accordance with design specifications contained in
“Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing
Areas,” 1998. The Water Quality volume shall take a minimum of twentyfour
(24) hours to be discharged from the basin. Development sites
where the post developed impervious area is equal to or less than the
pre-developed impervious area shall not be required to provide water
quality volume, unless required by NPDES Part II.
(Ord. 568, 5/6/2014, §306)
§307. Riparian Corridors.
1. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian corridor
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a riparian corridor.
2. Except as otherwise required by Chapter 102, the riparian corridor
easement shall be measured to be the greater of the limit of the one hundred
(100) year floodplain or thirty-five (35) feet from the top of streambank (on
each side).
3. Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Corridors.
A. Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained
within the riparian corridor easement.
B. Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian corridor easement shall be planted with native
trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native plant
community appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.
4. The riparian corridor easement shall be enforceable by the
municipality and shall be recorded in the Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds
Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private
ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area as required by Zoning,
unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
5. Any permitted use within the riparian corridor easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing one
hundred (100) year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
6. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian corridors:
A. Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
B. Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native
plant species and other sensitive environmental features.
7. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be

Municipality (hereinafter referred to as the "O&M Plan") for the property identified herein, which is
attached hereto as Appendix A and made part hereof, as approved by the Municipality, provides for
management of stormwater within the confines of the Property through the use of Stormwater
Management Best Management Practices (BMPs); and
WHEREAS, the Municipality, and the Landowner, his successors„ heirs, and assigns, agree that
the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Municipality and the protection and maintenance of
water quality require that on-site SWM Facilities be constructed and maintained on the Property; and
WHEREAS, the Municipality requires, through the implementation of the SWM Site Plan, that
SWM Facilities as required by said SWM Site Plan and the Municipal Stormwater Management
Ordinance be constructed and adequately operated and maintained by the Landowner, successors, and
assigns.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing promises, the mutual covenants
contained herein, and the following terms and conditions, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. The Landowner shall construct the SWM Facilities in accordance with the plans and

As of the effective date of this Chapter, the use of all land and every building or portion of a building
erected, altered with respect to height and area, added to, or relocated, and every use within a building or

buildings or uses in §§901 and 902.
§103. INTERPRETATION.
1. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum

such request as a special exception. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the authority to permit
the use or deny the use in accordance with the standards governing special exception applications.
The use may be permitted if it is similar to and compatible with the permitted uses in the zone in
which the subject property is located, is not permitted in any other zone under the terms of this
Ordinance, and in no way is in conflict with the general purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed use meets the

PART 9 - GENERAL REGULATIONS
§901. NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR USES.
1. Continuation. Any lawful use of a building or land existing or authorized by a building permit at
the effective date of this Chapter may be continued although such use does not conform to the
provisions of this Chapter. It shall be the intent of this Section, however, that the conversion of a
nonconforming building or use to a conforming use is to be encouraged to such extent as is
reasonable.
2. Extension.
A. No nonconforming use may be extended onto any adjoining lots or land not owned in
common with the lots or land on which the nonconforming use was located at the time of
adoption of the New Holland Borough Zoning Ordinance of 2019, as amended.
B. A nonconforming building shall not be extended or structurally altered, except insofar as
is required by law to assure the structural safety of a building; provided, however, that the
Zoning Hearing Board may, as a special exception, authorize:
(1) The structural alteration of a nonconforming building where such alteration is
necessary for the building or the use of the building to conform to the
requirements of the district in which such building is situated; and,
(2) The extension of a nonconforming use of a portion of a building throughout the
building, or the limited extension of a building which is devoted to a
nonconforming use on a lot, provided that (a) it is clear that such extension is not
materially detrimental to the character of the surrounding area or the interest of
the Borough, (b) the area devoted to nonconforming use shall in no case be
increased by more than fifty (50%) percent, and (c) such extension shall conform
to the area, height, and setback regulations of the district in which it is situated.
3. Changes. Any change from a nonconforming use of a building or land to any other
nonconforming use of the building or land must first be approved as a special exception by the
Zoning Hearing Board, pursuant to the provisions of §1607.
4. Restoration. A nonconforming building wholly or partially destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, or
other phenomenon, or legally condemned, may be reconstructed, repaired and used for the same
nonconforming use, provided that building reconstruction shall be commenced within one (1)
year from the date the building was destroyed or condemned and shall be carried on without
interruption.
577
5. Abandonment. If a nonconforming use of a building or land ceases for a continuous period of one
(1) year or more, it shall be presumed that the nonconforming use has been abandoned.
Thereafter, no nonconforming use of the building or land shall be made, and any use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.
§902. NONCONFORMING LOTS.
1. Held in Single and Separate Ownership. A building may be erected or altered on any lot held at
the effective date of this Chapter in single and separate ownership which is not of the required
minimum area or width or is of such unusual dimensions that the owner would have difficulty in
providing the required open spaces for the district in which such lot is situated, provided plans for
the proposed work shall be approved by the Zoning Hearing Board, after review of such plans to
assure reasonable compliance with the spirit of the zoning regulations for the district.
2. Included in Recorded Plans. Buildings may be erected on lots which are not held in single and
separate ownership at the effective date of the enactment of this Chapter and which are not of the
required area or width, if such lots are included in a land subdivision and development plan which
has been approved by Borough Council prior to the effective date of the enactment of this
Chapter.
3. Reduction of Lot. No lot area shall be so reduced that the area of the lot or the dimensions of the
open space shall be smaller than herein prescribed.
§903. CERTAIN PUBLIC UTILITY BUILDINGS EXEMPTED.
This Part shall not apply to any existing or proposed building or extension thereof, used or to be used by a
public utility corporation, if upon petition of such corporation, the Pennsylvania Public Utility

question is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public.
§904. YARD EXCEPTION FOR RESIDENTIAL GARAGE, ACCESSORY
STRUCTURE, PUBLIC SERVICES.

structural part of a main building, may be located in the required side and/or rear yard, but not less than
three feet from any property line unless a fence is erected on the property line in which case the
residential garage and accessory structure may abut the fence. The aforementioned provisions of this
Section shall not apply to a side or rear yard which abuts a street and nothing in this Section shall be
578
construed to prohibit the erection of common or joint garage which is not an integral structural part of a
main building on adjoining lots. Any above ground patio or deck must conform to the setback regulations
of the district in which it is situated. Structures or uses supporting public utilities, services, transmission
lines, buildings or facilities are exempt from the use, area and yard requirements of this Part, except

maintained which may cause a hazard or danger to traffic on a street by obscuring the safe stopping sight
distance.
§906. PROHIBITED USES.
1. No building may be erected, altered, or used, and no lot or premises may be used in a residential
or commercial district for any use which is noxious or offensive by reason of odor, dust,
vibration, illumination, or noise, or which constitutes a public hazard whether by fire, explosion,
or otherwise, in the immediately surrounding area. In an M Manufacturing District, no use which
shall create a noxious, offensive, or hazardous condition beyond the subject property line shall be
permitted. In determining whether a proposed manufacturing use is noxious, hazardous, or
offensive, the following standards shall apply. The proposed operation or use shall not:
A. Constitute a public nuisance by reason of dissemination of noxious, toxic, or corrosive
fumes, smoke, odor, or dust;
B. Result in noise or vibration exceeding the average intensity of noise or vibration
occurring from other causes at the subject property line as outlined in the New Holland
Borough Noise Ordinance;
C. Endanger surrounding areas by reason of fire or explosion;
D. Produce objectionable heat or glare in a neighboring non-industrial area;
E. Result in electrical disturbance in nearby residences;
F. Contribute to the pollution of waters; or,

be detrimental to the proper use of the surrounding area.
579
2. The applicant for a use which is subject to review by the Zoning Hearing Board shall
demonstrate, as a condition of approval that adequate provisions will be made to reduce and
minimize any objectionable elements to the degree necessary to insure that the proposed use will
not be noxious, hazardous, or offensive as defined above. In order to determine that adequate
safeguards are provided, the Zoning Officer or the Zoning Hearing Board may: (1) require that
the applicant submit necessary information, plans, impartial expert judgments, and written
assurance; (2) obtain the expert advice of official agencies or of private experts or consultants;

where the unreasonableness of these regulations are clearly demonstrated. In any case, however,
the Board shall require that the requirements of this Section be met insofar as is practicable.

§1607. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW FOR PROPOSED SPECIAL
EXCEPTION OR VARIANCE.
1. In any instance where the Zoning Hearing Board is required to consider a special exception or
variance in this Chapter or map in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, the Board
shall, among other things:
A. Give full consideration to the size, scope, extent, and character of the special
exception or variance desired and assure itself that such request is consistent with the
spirit, purpose and intent of this Chapter.
B. Determine that the proposed change will not substantially injure or detract from the
use of neighboring property or from the character of the neighborhood and that the
use of the property adjacent to the area included in the proposed change or plan is
adequately safeguarded.
C. Determine that the proposed change will serve the best interest of the Borough, the
convenience of the community, and the public welfare.
D. Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical, efficient and economical
extension of public services and facilities such as public water, sewers, police, fire
protection, and public schools.
E. Consider the probable effects of proposed development on traffic and insure that
adequate access arrangements are provided in order to protect major streets from
undue congestion and hazard.
604
F. Be guided in its study, review, and recommendation by sound standards of
subdivision practice where applicable.
G. Determine that any proposed special exception or variance complies fully with each
requirement of law relating to Board powers and, in the case of a special exception,
with any more specific standards relating to a use or exception contained in this
Chapter.
H. Make a final determination based on grounds other than purely aesthetic
considerations.
2. In the case of variance, in addition to any applicable standards of the subsection above, the
more specific requirements contained in Article IX of the Planning Code shall apply.
According to the State Code, the Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance provided that
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship required by law is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that
the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Chapter
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property;
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare; and,
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford
relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
3. In granting any variance or special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of the Planning Code and this Chapter, which conditions
and safeguards, may relate to, but are not limited to the harmonious design of buildings,
planting, and its maintenance as a sight or sound screen, lighting, noise, safety, and the
minimizing of noxious, offensive, or hazardous elements.

§1608. TIME LIMITATIONS.
1. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing Board later than
thirty (30) days after an application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved
by the Borough if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in
any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest
after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The
failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative
plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of this
Chapter or an amendment hereto or map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal
from a final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates
from the approved tentative approval.
2. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed by the landowner
within thirty (30) days after notice of the determination is issued.
§1609. STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
1. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board and during its
pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order
or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder,
shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of
zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or
body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved
and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings
before the Board.
2. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the
appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It
shall be the burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it
606
shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to
post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by them if an
appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.
3. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall
be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be
interlocutory. An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
4. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order of the court
dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellate court sustains the
order of the court below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon
motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals,
shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
