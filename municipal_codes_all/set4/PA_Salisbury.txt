PERSONNEL POLICIES
§ 1-301. Defining Personnel Policies. [Ord. 511, 3/13/1986]
Upon recommendation of the Township Manager, the following Personnel
Policies are hereby further defined. Where these policies conflict with
employee contracts, the contract shall control:
1. Probationary Period.
A. Objective. The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral
part of the employee selection process and shall be utilized for
closely observing the employee's work, securing the most effective
adjustment of a new employee to his or her position and for
rejecting any employee whose performance is not satisfactory. This
provision shall apply only to permanent full-time positions.
B. Duration. The probationary period shall be for a minimum of three
months to a maximum of 12 months. The following probationary
periods are hereby adopted for the following classes of
employment:
Class Employment Probation Period
Police 1 year
Engineering 6 months
Administrative 6 months
Technical 6 months
Clerical 3 months
Labor 3 months
C. Probationary Period for New Employee.
(1) At any time during the probationary period, the appointing
authority may remove any employee if, in his opinion and that
of the employee's immediate supervisor, the worker's
performance indicates that such employee is unable or
unwilling to perform the duties of the position satisfactorily or
that his or her habits or lack of dependability do not merit his
or her continuance in the service. The Manager shall forth-with
report to the employee removed, the action and reasons
therefor.
(2) A probationary employee who is found to have been appointed
through fraud or error shall be removed within 10 calendar
days of notification to this effect by the Manager to the
department head.
(3) During the probationary period a new employee shall accrue
but not be eligible for the use of vacation, sick leave, personal
§ 1-301 FOREWORD § 1-301
FWD:7
days, or the dental program. From the end of the probationary
period until December 31 of the year hired, each new employee
would be entitled to use the dental coverage and personal days
on a pro-rata basis.
2. Promotional Appointments. The probationary period shall be used in
connection with promotional appointments in the same manner as it is
used for original entrance appointments. If a person is removed during
his probationary period following a promotion, he or she shall be
entitled to return to his or her former position.
3. Residency. All permanent full-time employees shall become a resident
of the Township or reside within a five mile radius of the Salisbury
Township Municipal Building within six months of successfully
completing their probationary period. This policy would be extended to
the Police Department and Public Works Department if a slide
agreement to their respective employee agreements is adopted.

plans) or other provisions of the Code. However, "compensation" shall
not include payments made to a participant for waiving health/medical

shall be unfit for such service, when he shall be finally discharged
by reason of age or disability. This section shall not affect the
purpose of Subsection 1B of this § 1-602 to require retirement age
at age 65, nor shall said Subsection 1B bar any participant from
service as a police reserve.
2. Normal Retirement. Each participant who shall complete the age and
service eligibility requirements as set forth in § 1-602, Subsection 1,
shall, upon retirement, receive a pension for life payable in equal

with Act 600.
3. Death Benefits.
A. Qualification for Death Benefit. The beneficiaries (as defined in
Subsection 3D) of a police officer shall be entitled to receive a
death benefit if the police officer dies:
(1) After he/she has begun receiving benefits under a normal
retirement benefit; or
§ 1-602 FOREWORD § 1-602
FWD:15
(2) After he/she has begun receiving disability retirement benefits,
provided that such benefits did not terminate prior to his/her
death because he/she ceased to be disabled; or

Subsection 3A(1), (2) or (3); or
(2) Beginning on the first day of the month following the expected
normal retirement date of the deceased police officer and

there is no person who qualifies as a beneficiary;
(4) In a monthly amount equal to:
(a) Fifty percent of the monthly amount being received by the
police officer at the time of his/her death, or would have
been receiving had the police officer been retired at the
date of death, as described in Subsection 3A(1), (2) or (3);
or
(b) Fifty percent of the monthly vested accrued amount the
police officer would have been entitled to receive, as
described in Subsection 3A(4).
C. (Reserved)
D. Beneficiaries.
(1) In General. Any given payment in the series of payments which
constitutes the death benefit shall be paid to the person(s) who
is/are a beneficiary as of the date for which the payment is
being made.
(2) Definition. For purposes of the death benefit, the beneficiary of
a police officer shall be his/her spouse. If there is no spouse or
if the spouse survives and subsequently dies, then the death
benefit shall be payable to the police officer's child or children
who have not yet attained age 18 (or are attending college and
have not yet attained age 23). For purposes of this subsection,
a person is attending college if he/she is registered at an
accredited institution of higher learning and is carrying a
§ 1-602 SALISBURY CODE § 1-602
FWD:16
minimum course load of seven credit hours per semester. The
death benefit shall be payable to eligible children in equal
shares.
E. Death Benefit Return of Accumulated Contributions.
(1) In General. If a police officer:
(a) Dies at a time when his/her beneficiaries are not eligible to
receive a death benefit, or has no beneficiaries; and
(b) Has not received any payments under a normal retirement
benefit, disability retirement benefit, or vested benefit;
then the Plan shall distribute an amount equal to the
amount of the police officer's accumulated contributions
plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum to the police
officer's named beneficiaries. If the police officer failed to
designate a beneficiary or if no designated beneficiary
shall have survived the police officer, the distribution shall
be made to the estate of the police officer.
(2) Time of Payment. A distribution under this Subsection 3E shall
be made as soon as practicable after the designated recipient
or personal representative of the police officer files an election
to receive the distribution.
F. No Other Death Benefits. Except as provided in this section, no
police officer or former police officer and no estate, heir, or
beneficiary of any police officer or former police officer shall
receive any payment or benefit under this Plan or from the Trust
due to the death of a police officer or former police officer.
4. Designation of Beneficiaries. Each participant shall have the right to
designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries for pre-retirement death
benefits incidental to policies of insurance purchased primarily to fund
the participant's pension. Provided, however, that ownership of such
policies shall remain in the Township and shall be endorsed to prevent
the assignment of ownership to the insured. If the participant shall fail
to name a beneficiary, such benefits that would have accrued to his
beneficiary shall be paid to the participant's estate. All designations of
beneficiaries shall be made in writing and each participant may from
time to time change his designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries.
5. Disability Retirement Benefit.
A. If a police officer shall qualify for a permanent and total servicerelated
disability benefit under the provisions of the Plan, such
police officer shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit from the
Plan.
B. In the event of permanent and total service-related disability,
benefits shall become payable to an injured police officer each
§ 1-602 FOREWORD § 1-602
FWD:17
month in an amount equal to 75% of the compensation paid to
the officer as a full-time police officer during the last 36 months
of service immediately preceding the officer's last day of actual
service, divided by 36 (or, if greater, 50% of the police officer's
monthly salary at the time the disability was incurred), provided
that the police officer who receives benefits for the same injuries
under the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.)
shall have the disability benefit offset or reduced by the amount of
such social security benefits. For purposes of this Subsection 5B
alone and not for the purposes of Subsection 2 or any other section
of this plan, and without any effect on the definition of the term
"compensation," a police officer's "monthly salary" on a given date
is the officer's base hourly rate of compensation as of that date
(without any premium for shift differential, overtime, special duty
pay, or any other premium or multiplier), multiplied by 2,080 and
divided by 12. [Amended by Ord. No. 02-2014-585, 2/27/2014]
C. Total and permanent disability means a physical or mental
condition of a member resulting from bodily injury or disease or
mental disorder contracted, without fault or misconduct on such
police officer's part, from the performance of such officer's duties
in the Police Department, which renders the member incapable of
continuing in the employment as a police officer for the Township.
D. A determination by the Township or its designated agent that a
police officer is totally and permanently disabled shall be required
for such member to receive a disability benefit under the Plan.
Before making such determination, the Township or its designated
agent shall secure the opinion of one or more practicing physicians
licensed to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The Township shall have the right to require a
physical examination and a redetermination at its option.
6. Non Alienation of Benefits and Vesting.
A. No benefit under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance or charge. Nor shall any such benefits be in any
manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment, execution,
levy or other legal process.
B. All benefits granted herein shall vest in the participant upon
completion of the requirements for eligibility, and his benefits shall
continue in the amount and in the form in which he first became
entitled to them.
C. A vested benefit as described in this section is hereby authorized
provided such vested benefit does not impair the actuarial
soundness of the Fund as determined by an approved actuary. For
the purposes of this ordinance "approved actuary" means a person
who has at least five years of actuarial experience with public
§ 1-602 SALISBURY CODE § 1-602
FWD:18
pension plans and who is either enrolled as a member of the
American Academy of Actuaries or enrolled as an actuary pursuant
to the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Under the provisions of such benefit, should a police officer, before
completing superannuation retirement age and service
requirements but after having completed 12 years of total service,
for any reason cease to be employed as a full-time police officer
by the Township, he or she shall be entitled to vest his or her
retirement benefits by filing with the Board of Commissioners
within 90 days of the date he or she ceases to be full-time police
officer, a written notice of his or her superannuation retirement
date she had continued to be employed as a full-time police officer,
he or she shall be paid a partial superannuation retirement
allowance determined by applying the percentage his or her years
of service bears to the years of service which he or she would
have rendered had he or she continued to work until his or her
superannuation retirement date to the gross pension established
by § 1-602 of this Part using, however, the compensation during
the appropriate period prior to his or her termination of
employment. Such pension or retirement benefits for any month
shall be the sum of Subsections 1 through 3 of § 1-602 of this Part
to the extent necessary to bring the total benefits in any month
up to his or her partial superannuation retirement allowance as
outlines herein. It is the intention of this section to provide a
vested benefit as and to the extent authorized by Act No. 1979-99.
7. Military Service Provisions.
A. Nonintervening Military Service. Members who have performed
military service prior to employment with the Township shall be
permitted to buy back their service time, consistent with the
present provisions of Act 600.
(1) A police officer may purchase military service time to be
applied to his/her pension pursuant to the terms and conditions
of 53 P.S. 770. Every participant of the Police Pension Plan and
of the Township, who has not served in such employment prior
to entering the military service of the United States of
America, shall be entitled to full service credit for each year of
military service or a fraction thereof, not to exceed five years
upon purchasing of credit for such nonintervening military
service to be computed by applying the average normal cost
rate for Borough and Township Police Pension Plans as
certified by the Public Employee Retirement Commission, but
not to exceed 10%, to the participant's averaged annual rate of
compensation over the first three years of municipal service
and multiplying the result by the number of years and
fractional part of a year of creditable nonintervening military
service being purchased together with interest at the rate of
§ 1-602 FOREWORD § 1-602
FWD:19
4 3/4% compounded annually from the date of initial entry into

1. Contributions of Participants. Each participant shall be required to
contribute to the fund not less than 5% nor more than 8% of his/her
monthly compensation. Such contributions may be reduced or
eliminated on an annual basis by resolution or ordinance at the
discretion of the Township Board of Commissioners. Such contributions
shall be reduced or eliminated each year to the extent required under
the then-current collective bargaining agreement between the
Township and the Salisbury Township Police Officers Association.
Effective January 1, 2013, the employee contributions under this
Subsection 1 which are made via payroll deduction, although
designated as employee contribution, shall be treated for federal
income tax purposes as salary reductions rather than deductions and
thus as being paid by the employer as "pick up" contributions under
Internal Revenue Code § 414(h)(2). Under current law, such
contributions are not subject to federal income tax at the time of
the contributions, but only at the time when plan benefits are paid.
(However, these amounts are considered "wages" subject to current
FICA taxation and also current income for Pennsylvania state and local
income taxes.) A participant shall not have the option of receiving the
amount of employee contributions required under this Subsection 1
directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the plan. This
subsection shall be construed to include all requirements necessary to
satisfy the provisions of Internal Revenue Code § 414(h)(2).
2. Contributions of the Township.
A. Past Service Liability. It shall be the obligation of the Township to
fund any unfunded past service liability as determined by the
actuary. Such liability may be funded over a period not to exceed 30
years.
B. Future Service Cost. The Township shall have no liability for the
future service cost of the pension fund unless such costs are not
met by the allocation of commonwealth funds and participants'
contributions (if any). The maintenance of the actuarial soundness
shall be the responsibility of the Township.
C. Administrative Expenses. It shall be the obligation of the Township
to pay the administrative expenses incurred in the management of
the fund and plan out of the police pension fund.
3. Allocation of Commonwealth Funds. The payments made by the State
Treasurer to the Township from the monies received from the taxes

receive a pension after having contributed to the Fund, shall upon
discontinuance of his/her employment with the Township's police force,
for whatever reason, be refunded all such contributions, as well as any
contributions made to any predecessor fund whose assets have been
transferred to this fund, together with simple interest at the rate of 5% per
annum on the amount of said contributions. Said interest shall be calculated
on a quarterly basis and all contributions made in any quarter shall be

the Fund, including gifts, bequests, devises and grants shall, unless
otherwise specifically provided, be applied equally against the
participant's and the Township's portion of the Future Service Cost.

predecessor Pension Fund which had been established by an ordinance
enacted by the Township on February 12, 1959, have already been
transferred to and made a part of the Fund.
1. Neither the establishment of the Fund nor this Plan, nor any
modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund or account, nor the
payment of any benefits, shall be construed as giving to any participant
or other person any legal or equitable right against the Township, or
any officer or employee thereof, or the Board, except as herein
provided. Under no circumstances shall the Fund created hereby
constitute a contract for continuing employment for any participant or
in any manner obligate the Township to continue or discontinue the
services of a participant.
2. The Fund and this Plan have been established and shall be maintained
by the Township in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The Fund and Plan shall continue for such period as may
be required by such laws and should such laws provide that the
Township may, by its own action, discontinue the Fund, the Township
reserves the right to take such action, in its sole and absolute
discretion. Upon termination, the Township shall have no liability
hereunder other than that imposed by law.

authorize or permit any part of the Fund to be used or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants, their beneficiaries
or their estates. Nor shall any amendment divest a participant of vested
benefits or be contrary to existing law.
1. Administration to be Vested in Board.
A. The administration of this Plan shall be vested in the Board which
may, in its discretion, appoint a Police Pension Committee and
delegate to such Committee such duties and responsibilities with
respect to the operation of the Plan as it shall determine.
B. The Board may employ at suitable compensation such attorney,
agents, and employees, including an actuary or actuaries, as it may

Part 13
OPEN RECORDS POLICY
§ 1-1301. Purpose. [Ord. 12-2008-543, 12/23/2008]
The purpose of this Part 13 is to assure compliance with Act 3 of 2008,
the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, as amended, to provide access to
public records of Salisbury Township, to preserve the integrity of Salisbury
Township's records, and to minimize the financial impact to the residents
of the Township regarding the resources utilized in the receipt of and
processing of public record requests and the retrieval and copying of public
records.
§ 1-1302. Designated Open Records Officer; Access Policy; Fees.
[Ord. 12-2008-543, 12/23/2008; as amended by Ord. No.
07-2018-618, 7/26/2018]
1. It is the policy of the Township to require the presence of a designated
employee when public records are examined and inspected and to
charge reasonable fees for duplication of public records of the
Township. Salisbury Township designates the Township Manager as the
Open Records Officer and the Administrative Assistant to the Township
Manager as the Alternate Open Records Officer, who shall be
responsible for assuring compliance with the Pennsylvania Right-to-
Know Law, in accordance with the following guidelines:
A. The Open Records Officer and/or Alternate may designate certain
employee(s) to process public record requests.
B. The Open Records Officer and/or Alternate is responsible for
minimizing, where possible, the financial impact to the Township
regarding the resources utilized in the receipt and processing of
public record requests and the retrieval and copying of public
records.
C. All requests for public records of the Township under this policy
shall be specific in identifying and describing each public record
requested. In no case shall the Township be required to create a
public record which does not exist or to compile, maintain, format
or organize a public record in a manner in which the Township does
not currently compile, maintain, format or organize the public
record. All requests for public records shall be submitted in writing
and include the date of the request, requestor's name, address, and
telephone number; certification of United States residency;
signature of requestor; and if duplication is requested, appropriate
payment.
D. The designated employee shall make a good-faith effort to
determine whether each record requested is a public record.
§ 1-1301 FOREWORD § 1-1302
FWD:75
E. The Township shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for
Township public records. In no case is the Township expected to
provide extraordinary staff to respond to the request, but it will
respond in a manner consistent with the Township's administrative
responsibilities and consistent with the requirements of the
Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law.
F. The designated employee shall respond to the requester within five
business days from the date of receipt of the written request. If the
Township does not respond within five business days of receipt
thereof, the request is deemed denied.
G. The response provided by the Township shall consist of:
(1) Approval for access to the public record;
(2) Review of the request by the designated employee; or
(3) Denial of access to the record requested.
H. If access to the public record requested is approved, the public
record shall be available for access during the regular business
hours of the Township. The designated employee shall cooperate
fully with the requester, while also taking reasonable measures to
protect Township public records from the possibility of theft and/or
modification. The presence of a designated employee is required
when public records are examined and inspected.
I. Fees for duplication of public records shall be as established by the
commonwealth's Office of Open Records. The Township may, at its
discretion, waive fees and, by resolution, set forth fees as not
otherwise established by the commonwealth's Office of Open
Records.
J. In the event that the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted
under this policy is expected to exceed $100, the designated
employee(s) shall obtain the expected cost in advance of fulfilling
the request to avoid unwanted expense of Township resources.
K. If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the
Township shall be in writing and include the reason for the review
and the expected response date, which shall be within 30 days of
the notice of review. If the Township does not respond within 30
days thereof, the request is deemed denied.
(1) Review of the request is limited to situations where:
(a) The record requested contains information which is
subject to access as well as information which is not
subject to access that must be redacted prior to a grant of
access. The redacted information is considered a denial as
to that information.
§ 1-1302 SALISBURY CODE § 1-1302
FWD:76
(b) The record requires retrieval from a remote location.
(c) A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing
limitations.
(d) A legal review is necessary to determine whether the
record requested is a public record.
(e) The requester has failed to comply with the Township's
policy and procedure requirements.
(f) The requester refuses to pay the applicable fees.
(g) The extent or nature of the request precludes a response
within the required time period.
(2) Upon a determination that one of the factors listed above
applies, the Township shall send written notice to the
requester within five business days of receipt of the request for
access. The notice shall include a statement notifying the
requester that the request for access is being reviewed, the
reason for the review, a reasonable date that a response is
expected to be provided, and an estimate of applicable fees
owed when the record becomes available. If the date that a
response is expected to be provided is in excess of 30 days,
following the five business days allowed for, the request for
access shall be deemed denied unless the requester has
agreed, in writing, to an extension to the date specified in the
notice. If the requester agrees to the extension, the request
shall be deemed denied on the day following the date specified
in the notice if the Township has not provided a response by
that date.
L. If access to the record requested is denied, the notice provided by
the Township shall be in writing as indicated on the form attached
hereto entitled "Denial of Request to Review and/or Duplicate the
Township of Salisbury Records."8
M. If the request is denied or deemed denied, the requester may file an
appeal with the commonwealth's Office of Open Records within 15
business days of the mailing date of the Township's notice of denial
or within 15 days of a deemed denial. The appeal shall state the
grounds upon which the requester asserts that the record is a
public record and shall address any grounds stated by the
Township for delaying or denying the request.
N. Within 30 days of the mailing date of the final determination of the
appeals officer, the requester or Township may file a petition for
review or other document as required by rule of court with the
Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County. The decision of the court
8. Editor's Note: the form is on file at the Township offices.
§ 1-1302 FOREWORD § 1-1302
FWD:77
shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon
the evidence as a whole. The decision shall clearly and concisely
explain the rationale for the decision. A petition for review under
this section shall stay the release of documents until a decision of
the court is issued.
O. This policy shall be available for review at the Township office.

or other structure, the insurance company, association or exchange
shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the designated officer
of the municipality in the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000
and each fraction of that amount of a claim; or, if at the time
of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured and the
insurance company, association or exchange, the named insured
has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure,
the insurance company, association or exchange shall transfer from
the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. The
transfer of proceeds shall be on a prorate basis by all companies,
associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.

section, the designated officer shall place the proceeds in a
separate fund to be used solely as security against the total cost of
removing, repairing or securing incurred by the municipality. When
transferring the funds as required in Subsection 1C of this section,
an insurance company, association or exchange shall provide the
municipality with the name and address of the named insured,
whereupon the municipality shall contact the named insured,
certify that the proceeds have been received by the municipality
and notify the named insured that the procedures under this
subsection shall be followed. The fund shall be returned to the
named insured when repairs, removal or securing of the building or

received by the designated officer if the municipality has not
incurred any costs of repairs, removal or securing. If the
municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of
the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund, and, if excess funds remain, the municipality shall transfer
the remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the ability of the municipality to recover
any deficiency. Further, nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the municipality and the named insured from
entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the
named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.

the occupants or their guests of their responsibility for their conduct
or activity, nor shall it be construed as an assignment, transfer or
projection over or onto any owner of any responsibility or liability
which occupants or their guests may have as a result of their conduct

franchisee make such cable services available in the Township.
Should the Township determine that franchisee shall commence
provision of such cable services, then the Township and franchisee
shall enter into good faith discussions to negotiate a schedule
for deployment of such cable services. The discussions shall take
into consideration the benefits from the provision of such cable
services, the cost of implementing them in the Township, and the
impact, if any, on subscriber rates.
4. Technical Requirement.
A. Franchisee shall operate, maintain, construct and extend the cable
system so as to provide high quality signals and reliable delivery of
one-way and two-way cable services for all programming services

it will grant such subscriber a pro rata credit or rebate, on a daily basis,
of that portion of the service charge during the next consecutive billing

device or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose without the
prior written authorization of the affected subscriber or user,
unless directed by an appropriate law enforcement officer;
provided, however, that upon request by the franchising authority,
operator may conduct system-wide or individually addressed
"sweeps" solely for the purpose of verifying system integrity,
checking for illegal taps, controlling return-path transmission,
billing for pay services or monitoring channel usage in a manner
not inconsistent with the Cable Act. Operator shall report to the
affected parties any instances of monitoring or tapping of the cable
communications system, or any part thereof, of which it has
knowledge, whether or not such activity has been authorized by
operator. Operator shall not record or retain any information
transmitted between a subscriber or user and any third party,
except as required for lawful business purposes.

conducted or obtained, unless:
§ 13-206 SALISBURY CODE § 13-206
FWD:258
(1) The program of which the upstream response as a part
contains an explicit disclosure of the nature, purpose and
prospective use of the results of the poll or upstream response,
including responses to or orders to home shopping or similar
programming services.

educational function which is self-evident. Operator or its
designee shall release the results of upstream responses only
in the aggregate and without individual references.
I. Except as permitted by § 631 of the Cable Act, as amended, neither
operator nor its designee, nor its employees shall make available to
any third party, including Salisbury Township, information
concerning the viewing habits or subscription package decisions of
any individual subscriber. If a court authorizes such disclosure,
operator shall notify the subscriber not less than 14 calendar days
prior to disclosure, unless such notification is otherwise prohibited
by applicable law or the court.
J. Upon a request by a subscriber, operator shall make available for
inspection by a subscriber at a reasonable time and place all
personal subscriber information that operator maintains regarding
said subscriber. Operator shall ensure that all information related

cost for a missing converter. In the event that a subscriber supplies
operator with a police or fire report which evidences that the loss of a
converter resulted from theft or fire, operator shall waive any charges.

performed within seven business days after an order has been
placed. "Standard" installations are those aerial installations that
are located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution system.
C. Excluding conditions beyond its control, franchisee shall begin
working on a service interruption promptly and in no event later
than 24 hours after the interruption becomes known and shall
diligently pursue to completion. Notice of a service interruption of
a single subscriber shall give rise to this obligation on behalf of
franchisee. All other service calls not affecting public health, safety
or welfare shall occur within a maximum of 48 hours after notice to
franchisee or scheduled at the convenience of the customer and
shall be diligently pursued to completion.
D. Upon scheduling of appointments with the customer for
installations, service calls and other activities, franchisee shall
provide the customer with either a specific time or an "appointment
window" of a maximum of four hours during normal business hours.
Franchisee may schedule service calls and installation activities
outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of the
customer. This "appointment window" may be expanded to an "all
day window," but only if desired by the subscriber and that such "all
day window" appointment would afford subscriber sooner than
seven day appointment.
E. Franchisee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after
the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled
appointment. If, at any time, an installer or technician is running
late, an attempt to contact the customer must be made prior to the

convenient location for the purpose of accepting payments and
distributing, receiving and exchanging converter boxes. Operator will

current before such work is performed.
D. All rates for subscriber services shall be published and
nondiscriminatory. A written schedule of all rates shall be available
upon request during business hours at operator's business office.
Nothing in this Part 2A shall be construed to prohibit the reduction
or waiver of charges in conjunction with promotional campaigns for
the purpose of attracting or retaining subscribers.
2. Privacy.
A. Franchisee shall protect and abide by the rights of privacy of every
subscriber and shall not violate such rights through the use of any

affected subscriber or user; provided, however, that franchisee may
conduct system-wide or individually addressed "sweeps" solely for
the purpose of verifying system integrity, checking for illegal taps,
controlling return-path transmission, billing for pay services or
monitoring channel usage in a manner not inconsistent with the
federal law. Franchisee shall not record or retain any information
transmitted between a subscriber and any third party, except as
required for lawful business purposes.
D. Except as permitted by § 631 of the Cable Act as amended, neither
franchisee nor its designee nor its employees shall make available
to any third party, including the Township, information concerning

individual subscriber. If a court authorizes or orders such
disclosure, franchisee shall notify the subscriber prior to
disclosure, unless such notification is otherwise prohibited by
applicable law or the court.
E. Upon a request by a subscriber, franchisee shall make available for
inspection at a reasonable time and place all personal subscriber
information that franchisee maintains regarding said subscriber.
Franchisee shall ensure that all information related to billing and

correct any errors upon discovery.

manner connected with the conduct or operation of its activities

Bicyclists are required to use an appropriate
frontal light throughout their entire visit in the
park after dusk.

building or any other trail manipulation is
prohibited. Possession of handsaws, chainsaws,
§ 16-112 FOREWORD § 16-112
FWD:361
loppers, shovels, rakes, or any other trail clearing
or building tool or material is prohibited, except

c) Visitors assume all risks and must be reasonably
prepared and equipped, take reasonable
precautions against endangering themselves or
others, and must wear appropriate footwear and
clothing.
d) No person may deface, paint, damage, mutilate,
or vandalize any natural or cultural object, or any
sign or structure within the Walking Purchase

the park from any liability associated with the use

§ 16-112 SALISBURY CODE § 16-112
FWD:362
personal injury, loss, death or property damage,
including attorney's fee.
3) Rules of the Trail. The Township adopts the following
rules of the trail, formulated by IMBA, the
International Mountain Bicycling Association. These
rules are recognized around the world as the standard
code of conduct for mountain bikers. IBMA's mission
is to promote mountain bicycling that is
environmentally sound and socially responsible:
a) Ride on Open Trails Only. Respect trail and road
closures. Ask if uncertain; avoid trespassing on
private land; obtain permits or other
authorization as may be required. The way you
ride will influence trail management decisions
and policies.
b) Leave No Trace. Be sensitive to the dirt beneath
you. Recognize different types of soils and trail
construction; practice low-impact cycling. Wet
and muddy trails are more vulnerable to damage.
When the trailbed is soft, consider other riding
options. This also means staying on existing trails
and not creating new ones. Don't cut switchbacks.
Be sure to pack out at least as much as you pack
in.
c) Control Your Bicycle! Inattention for even a
second can cause problems. Obey all bicycle
speed regulations and recommendations.
d) Always Yield Trail. Let your fellow trail users
know you're coming. A friendly greeting or bell is
considerate and works well; don't startle others.
Show your respect when passing by slowing to a
walking pace or even stopping. Anticipate other
trail users around corners or in blind spots.
Yielding means slow down, establish
communication, be prepared to stop if necessary
and pass safely.
e) Never Scare Animals. All animals are startled by
an unannounced approach, a sudden movement,
or a loud noise. This can be dangerous for you,
others, and the animals. Give animals extra room
and time to adjust to you. When passing horses
use special care and follow directions from the
horseback riders; ask if uncertain. Running cattle
and disturbing wildlife is a serious offense. Leave
gates as you found them, or as marked.
§ 16-112 FOREWORD § 16-112
FWD:363
f) Plan Ahead. Know your equipment, your ability,
and the area in which you are riding and prepare
accordingly. Be self-sufficient at all times, keep
your equipment in good repair, and carry
necessary supplies for changes in weather or
other conditions. A well-executed trip is a
satisfaction to you and not a burden to others.
Always wear a helmet and appropriate safety
gear.
g) Gear Up. Always wear a helmet and any other
appropriate safety equipment for the riding
conditions (cell phones, compass, etc.).
h) Never Ride Beyond Your Abilities. There is no
shame in walking sections of the trail you don't
feel confident enough to ride, and don't let
anybody tell you otherwise.
i) Use Appropriate Equipment for the Terrain. Some
bikes are better for different situations. Just
because you can see tire tracks, doesn't mean you
can ride it with your bike.
j) Keep Your Speed in Check. Always keep your
speed at a level that will allow you to adjust to any
unforeseen obstacles or changes in trail
conditions.
k) Know the Trail. Never push the limits on a trail
you are not familiar with. You need to get to know
the trail you are riding at slower speeds before
you can ride it like the trails you're used to.
l) Slow down for Blind Corners. You never know
what or who is around a corner when you can't
see past it.
m) Stop and Look. Stop and look at sections of the
trail that look like they may pose a challenge
before you ride them.
n) Plan on the Crash. Always look at the
consequences of crashing in a particular section
or on a particular stunt before trying to ride
through it. Sometimes a section can look easy to
ride but can have deadly consequences to a crash.
o) Start Small, Go Big. Work your way up to
obstacles and stunts. Find ways to practice moves
in less difficult and dangerous situations or at

(2) Beginning January 1, 2020, all owners of nonresidential
improved properties connected to the sewer system shall pay
sewer rentals or charges, except as hereinafter noted, at the
rate of $330 per annum, payable at the rate of $82.50 per
quarterly billing period per unit, or at a rate set from time to
time by duly enacted resolution by the Board of
Commissioners, on the basis of equivalent dwelling units
determined or computed as follows: [Amended by Res.
12-2012-1515, 12/17/2015; by Res. No. 12-2016-1551,

by Res. No. 12-2019-1656, 12/12/2019]
(a) Each church or chapel, firehouse, social hall or clubroom
shall constitute one equivalent dwelling unit. Where a
home occupation or home professional office which utilizes
water in the service it provides or the product it produces
is conducted in a building also used for residential
purposes, the sewer rate which shall be paid for such
property shall be calculated in the same manner as
commercial uses, i.e., on the basis of equivalent dwelling
units, and not on a flat-rate basis, but in no event less than
the flat-rate charges for residential users.
(b) Each school (public or private) shall constitute one
equivalent dwelling unit for each unit of 12 pupils
computed on the basis of the average number of pupils
enrolled on days when the school was in session during the
last full school fiscal year preceding the calendar year in
which the sewer rental or charge is payable. Teachers and
employees of the school shall be classified as pupils for
sewer rental purposes. On or before December 31 of each

year, the chief school administrator shall file a sworn
statement with this Township setting forth complete
information required in order to compute the sewer rental
or charge to each school.
(c) Equivalent dwelling units for all nonresidential users,
except as specified in Subsection 1B(2)(a) and (b) above,
shall be based upon the volume of water consumed or the
volume of discharge to the sewer system, as applicable;
provided, however, that the sewer rental or charge to each
industrial establishment discharging sewage and/or
industrial wastes into the sewer system shall not be less
than $2.60 per employee per quarter annum based upon
the average number of persons employed (including
employers) per working day during the service period for
which the billing is rendered. Equivalent dwelling units
based upon the volume of water consumed or the volume
of discharge to the sewer system shall be based upon one
equivalent dwelling unit for each 15,000 gallons of water
consumed or 15,000 gallons of waste discharged to the
sewer system, as applicable.
C. Exceptional-Strength Users.
(1) If any nonresidential user shall discharge any waste having a
strength exceeding 230 ppm of BOD or 250 ppm of SS, or 44
ppm of TKN, that user shall be charged as an exceptional
strength user in accordance with the following rates:
Basis Charge $1.20 per each 1,000 gallons
or fraction thereof
Plus:
For all BOD greater than 230
ppm
$0.88 per pound
For all SS greater than 250
ppm
$0.052 per pound
For all TRN greater than 44
ppm
$0.152 per pound
(2) The basis for determination of the strength of waste shall be a
seven-day composite sample taken once per billing period.
2. For service periods of less or more than one quarter annum, the sewer
rental or charge and the computation of the volume of water consumed
or the volume of discharge to the sewer system, as applicable, shall be
proportionately adjusted.
3. If the owner of any nonresidential improved property (including any
school) shall fail to provide this Township with complete information
required to compute the sewer rental or charge to such nonresidential

improved property, this Township may estimate a reasonable applicable
sewer rental or charge for such nonresidential improved property, and
such estimated sewer rental or charge shall be the actual sewer rental
or charge payable until the required information is filed; provided,
however, that no rebates will be paid by this Township if the information
filed reveals a lower indicated sewer rental or charge than that
estimated by this Township.
4. Additional classifications and sewer rentals or charges or modifications
of the above schedule of sewer rentals or charges may be established by
this Township from time to time as deemed necessary.
5. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit this Township
from entering into separate agreements with owners with respect to
sewer rentals or charges to be imposed in those cases where, due to
seasonal fluctuations or other unusual circumstances, the sewer rentals
or charges set forth herein shall be deemed by this Township to be
unfair or inequitable.
1. All bills for sewer rentals or charges, except those based on metered
water consumption or metered waste discharged or estimates of this
Township, shall be rendered in calendar quarters, on the first days of
January, April, July and October, respectively, in each year, or on such
other dates as this Township, by resolution, shall specify, and shall
cover a quarterly billing period consisting of the immediately preceding
three complete calendar months.
All bills for sewer rentals or charges based on metered water
consumption or metered waste discharged or estimates of this
Township shall be rendered for each quarter annum or other period
covered by the meter reading promptly after the meters are read or
estimates made.
2. All bills for sewer service furnished to consumers shall be due and
payable as of the date thereof. Bills for sewer service shall be paid
within 15 days after such bill shall become due and payable. The
customer shall pay the net amount of the bill, known as "Net 15." If bills
for such sewer service remain unpaid beyond 15 days of the billing
date, an additional 10% will be added to any current, outstanding
balance. If bills for such sewer service are paid during the period
between 16 and 30 days of the billing date, this gross amount of the bill
shall be due and payable. This shall be known as "Gross 30." If bills for
such sewer service are not paid within 30 days of the billing date
thereof, such bills shall be deemed delinquent and a penalty equal to
25% of the current Gross 30 amount of the bill shall be added to the
amount of the bill and collected as part thereof. When bills are paid by

[Ord. 100, 3/22/1966, § 4; as amended by Ord. 239, 10/28/1982, § 1]
Sewer rentals or charges imposed by this Part 3 shall be a lien on the
improved property connected to and served by the sewer system; and any
such sewer rentals or charges which are delinquent shall be filed as a lien
against the improved property so connected to and served by the sewer
system, which lien shall be filed in the office of the Prothonotary of Lehigh
County, Pennsylvania, and shall be collected in the manner provided by law
for the filing and collecting of Township claims.
All liens filed pursuant to this § 18-304 for sewer rentals or charges for any
period from or after January 1, 1983, shall bear interest at the rate of 10%
per annum from the date of filing to the date of payment.

Charges. [Ord. 100, 3/22/1966, § 5]
mail, the date of the postmark will be considered the date of the
payment.
3. Whenever any bill for sewer service furnished to a consumer shall
remain unpaid for a period in excess of thirty (30) days after the date
thereof, the Township shall mail a delinquency notice to the consumer,
which notice shall inform the customer of the delinquency and the
penalty and shall declare the intention of the Township to shut off and
discontinue water service. Water service will not be restored until the
bill, including penalties, together with a turn-off and turn-on charge of
$10 each, has been paid. Every owner of improved property which is
connected to the sewer system initially shall provide this Township with
and thereafter shall keep this Township advised of the owner's correct
address. Failure of any person to receive bills for sewer rentals or
charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment, nor shall
such failure result in an extension of the period of time during which
the net bill shall be payable.
4. Cancellation of Service. Subject to the provisions of this section, upon
failure of any consumer to comply with any provision set forth herein or
with any additional rules and regulations adopted by the Township
relating to the sewer system, the Township may shut off water service,
or have adjacent communities supplying water service to Salisbury
Township shut off water service, subject to the cut-off and turn-on rates
set forth in § 26-110 of Salisbury Township's Water Ordinance [Chapter
26] and any charges incurred by the adjacent communities.
5. The Board of Commissioners may, from time to time, by duly enacted
resolution of the Board, set new rules and rates to govern §§ 18-302 and
18-303.
1. Methods of Measuring Volume.
§ 18-303 SALISBURY CODE § 18-305
FWD:390
A. Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property
discharging sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system
is supplied by a public water system, the volume of water
furnished, as determined from meter readings of the public water
system, shall be used as the volume of water consumed in
computing equivalent dwelling units and sewer rentals or charges,
subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this Part 3.
B. Whenever an improved property discharging sewage and/or
industrial wastes into the sewer system shall have a source or
sources of water supply in addition to or other than the public
water system, the owner of such improved property shall provide a
meter on such additional or other source or sources of water
supply. The total volume of water consumed, as determined from
the meter readings on the public water system and the meter
readings of the meter or meters on such additional source or
sources of water supply, or the meter readings of the meter or
meters on such other source or sources of water supply, as
appropriate, shall be used as the volume of water consumed in
computing equivalent dwelling units and sewer rentals or charges,
subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this Part 3.
C. Upon written approval of the Township, the volume of water
consumed to be used for computation of sewer rentals or charges,
as provided in this Part 3, may be established by estimates or other
methods of measurement approved by the Township where the
Township considers metering to be impractical.
D. The Township may require an industrial establishment, or the
industrial establishment may elect, to install, pay for and maintain
a meter approved by the Township for measuring wastes
discharged to the sewer system, in which case equivalent dwelling
units and sewer rentals or charges shall be based upon the actual
volume of wastes so metered as being discharged to the sewer
system. Said sewer rentals or charges shall be computed as set
forth under § 18-302 of this Part 3.
E. Exclusion from the sewer system of noncontaminated wastewaters
and waters used for cooling purposes may be required by the
Township, or such exclusion may be optional with the owner if not
required by the Township. When such waters are excluded, the
volume of water or other measure to be used for computation of
equivalent dwelling units and sewer rentals or charges shall be
computed by one of the following methods:
(1) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the
connection to the sewer system. The readings from such meter
or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge
of sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing equivalent
dwelling units and sewer rentals or charges.
§ 18-305 FOREWORD § 18-305
FWD:391
§ 18-306. Access. [Ord. 100, 3/22/1966, § 8]
This Township shall have the right of access at reasonable times to any
part of any improved property served by the sewer system as shall be
required for purposes of inspection, measurement, sampling and testing
and for performance of other functions relating to service rendered by this
Township through the sewer system.
(2) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume of water not being discharged into the sewer system.
The readings from such meter or measuring device shall be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the
remainder shall be the volume of water to be used in
computing equivalent dwelling units and sewer rentals or
charges.
(3) If it is not practical, in the opinion of this Township, to install a
meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the
volume of water not discharged into the sewer system, this
Township shall determine, in such manner and by such method
as it may prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is
being discharged into the sewer system. The volume of water
to be used in computing equivalent dwelling units and sewer
rentals or charges shall be the percentage so determined of the
volume of water measured by the water meter or meters. Any
dispute as to such estimated percentage shall be submitted to
this Township, after notice of such estimate. The decision of
this Township with respect to the matter shall be final for the
current calendar year.
2. Measuring Devices. The furnishing and installation of meters or other
measuring devices which shall not be owned by any public or private
water company in connection with a water system, but which shall be
required or permitted under provisions of this Part 3, shall be the sole
responsibility of the owner. The installation or use of such meters or
other measuring devices at all times shall be subject to the approval of
this Township and may be tested and inspected by this Township
whenever necessary. The owner shall be responsible for the
maintenance, safe-keeping and repair of any such meter, whether such
repairs shall be made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other
causes.
3. Meter Readings. This Township shall be responsible for the reading of
all meters or other measuring devices, other than those owned and read
by any public or private water company, and the same shall be available
to employees and agents of this Township at all reasonable times.

Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in
a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the
criteria of Subsection A(2) or (3) above but otherwise alters, replaces,
or adds to existing process or production equipment.
B.
Construction of a new source as defined under this subsection has
commenced if the owner or operator has:
Begun, or caused to begin, as part of a continuous on-site
construction program:

8/12/2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/2017]
1. Prohibited Discharge Standards.
A. General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater that causes
pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to
all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
B. Specific Prohibitions.
(1) No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the
POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
(a) Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the
POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a
closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140° F. (60° C.) using the
test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21 or wastewater
causing two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the
point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the

FWD:403
POTW, of more than 5% or any single reading over 10% of
the lower explosive limit of the meter;
(b) Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.5,
or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the
POTW or equipment;
(c) Solid or viscous substances in amounts which, alone or in
combination with other substances, will cause obstruction
of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference;
(d) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD,
etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by
interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW;
(e) Wastewater having a temperature that will inhibit
biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the
temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to
exceed 104° F. (40° C.);
(f) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference
or pass through;
(g) Pollutants that result in the presence of toxic gases,

(s) Under 40 CFR Part 261.
(2) Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this
section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that
they could be discharged to the POTW.
2. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with
the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, which are hereby incorporated.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the Director of Public Works may impose equivalent
concentration or mass limits in accordance with Subsection 2D and
E of this section.
B. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production,
the Director of Public Works may convert the limits to equivalent
limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per
day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent
limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Director of Public Works shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR § 403.6(e).
§ 18-406 FOREWORD § 18-406
FWD:405
D. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request
that the City of Allentown convert the limits to equivalent mass
limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass
limits is within the discretion of the Director of Public Works. The
City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user
meets all the conditions set forth in Subsection 2D(1)(a) through (e)
of this section below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water
conservation methods and technologies that substantially
reduce water use during the term of its wastewater
discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment technologies
adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used
dilution as a substitute for treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based
on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device,
as well as the facility's long-term average production rate.
Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current
operating conditions;
(d) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits
are not appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the
industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
equivalent mass limits;
(b) Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility's production rates and
notify the Director of Public Works whenever production
rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its
baseline production rates determined in Subsection
2D(1)(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised
§ 18-406 SALISBURY CODE § 18-406
FWD:406
production rate, the Director of Public Works will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary
to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(d) Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those
implemented pursuant to Subsection 2D(1)(a) of this
section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass
limit.
(3) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director of Public
Works:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es)
of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily
maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate
unit conversion factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will
reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the
facility; and
(c) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial
user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as
a result of the implementation of water conservation
methods and technologies, and the actual average daily
flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent
mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a
substitute for treatment pursuant to Subsection 6 of this
section. The industrial user must also be in compliance
with § 18-417, Subsection 3, regarding the prohibition of
bypass.
E. The Director of Public Works may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and
455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations
applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the
discretion of the Director of Public Works.
§ 18-406 FOREWORD § 18-406
FWD:407
[Note: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the
Director of Public Works will use the concentrations listed in the
applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and
document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as
prohibited by Subsection 6 of this section [see 40 CFR403.6(d)].
In addition, the Director of Public Works will document how the
equivalent limits were derived for any changes from
concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this
information publicly available [see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)].
F. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in Subsection 2 of this section
in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived. [Note: See 40 CFR
403.6(c)(7).]
G. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit
for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average,
limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the
average and the maximum equivalent limitation. [Note: See 40
CFR403.6(c)(8)].
H. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production-based standard shall notify the Director of Public Works
within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to
know that the production level will significantly change within the
next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Director of Public
Works of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass
or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long-term average production rate. [Note: See 40
CFR 403.6(c)(9).]
3. State Pretreatment Standards. (Reserved)
4. Local Limits.
A. The Director of Public Works is authorized to establish local limits
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
B. Limits for discharging pollutants which are of concern to the
Township and/or POTW will be made using headworks loading
analyses which has been reviewed and approved by the approval
authority. Allocations for discharging such pollutants will be made
to each significant industrial user. Limits may be in the form of
monthly average concentration, daily maximum concentration, or
instantaneous maximum concentration. Limits will be contained in
the wastewater discharge permits issued and will be applied at the
point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW unless
§ 18-406 SALISBURY CODE § 18-406
FWD:408
§ 18-407. Pretreatment of Wastewater. [Ord. No. 08-2010-561, 8/12/
2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/2017]
otherwise specified in the permit issued. All concentrations for
metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated
otherwise. The Director of Public Works may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based
limitations above.
C. The Director of Public Works may develop best management
practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in wastewater discharge
permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of
Subsection 1 of this section.
5. Township's and City's Right of Revision. The Township and City reserve
the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits,
more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW
consistent with the purpose of this Part.
6. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any
way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The Director of Public Works may impose
mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
1. Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions
set out in § 18-406, Subsection 1, of this Part within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the state, or the Director of Public Works,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedure shall
be submitted to the Director of Public Works for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Director of Public Works before such facilities are
constructed. Review and acceptance of plans are not an endorsement of
the effectiveness of any facilities set forth therein and the Township and
the City shall not be held liable in any way for the performance of said
facilities. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities
as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Township and
the City under the provisions of this Part.
2. Additional Pretreatment Measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Director of Public Works may
require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
§ 18-406 FOREWORD § 18-407
FWD:409
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the Township
and/or POTW and determine the user's compliance with the
requirements of this Part.
B. The Director of Public Works may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued
solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Works, they are necessary for the
proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of
grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the Director of Public Works and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and
repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required by the Director of Public Works to install and maintain an
approved combustible gas detection meter.
3. Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. The Director of Public Works
shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an
accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug
discharge. The Director of Public Works may require any user to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan, or take such
other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges.
Alternatively, the Director of Public Works may develop such a plan for
any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a
minimum, the following:
A. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals;
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of Public Works
of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 18-410,
Subsection 6, of this Part; and
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants,
§ 18-407 SALISBURY CODE § 18-407
FWD:410
including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
4. Hauled Wastewater.
A. Any hauler, operator, person or persons cleaning cesspools, septic
tanks, privies or any other container governed by this section shall
obtain a license from the City before cleaning such containers and
hauling the material to the designated place of disposal within the
City. Such license cannot be transferred from one operator, owner,
person or persons, to another without prior approval by the City.
B. The sewage and wastes discharged into the POTW shall not contain
industrial waste, chemicals or other matter, with or without
pretreatment that does not conform to the requirements of
§ 18-406, Subsection 1, or any other requirements established by
the City. The Director of Public Works may require the hauler to
provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. The
Director of Public Works may require a hauler to obtain an
industrial waste discharge permit.
C. Any waste to be discharged from tank trucks shall be disposed at
the location designated by the Director of Public Works at the
POTW at the time or times fixed by the Director of Public Works.
D. Haulers must provide a waste-tracking form, or forms, for every
load. For each privy, cesspool, septic tank or container cleaned by a
hauler, operator or any person, a cleaning permit shall first be
obtained from the City by the person or persons intending to clean
such a receptacle. This form is to be issued by the City before the
beginning of said cleaning work. The form shall contain the
following:
(1) Name and address of the property owner at the source of the
waste;
(2) Date of issue;
(3) Name of hauler, operator or person contracted to clean this
structure, etc.;
(4) Type of container, septic tank, privy, cesspool or any other, and
volume;
(5) Serial number of permit;
(6) Signature of person completing the form.
E. Any tank truck or any equipment used or intended to be used for
the removal, transportation and disposal of sewage and industrial
wastes shall conform to the following requirements:
(1) The container shall be watertight;
§ 18-407 FOREWORD § 18-407
FWD:411
(2) Tanks, containers or other equipment shall be so constructed
that every portion of the interior and exterior can be easily
cleaned and shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition;
(3) Piping, valves and permanent or flexible connections shall be
accessible and easily disconnected for cleaning purposes;
(4) The inlet opening, or opening to every container, shall be so
constructed that the material will not spill outside during
filling, transfer or transport;
(5) The outlet connections shall be so constructed that no material
will leak out, run out to other than the point of discharge and
shall be of a design and type suitable for the material handled
and capable of controlling the flow or discharge without
spillage, undue spray or flooding immediate surroundings
while in use;
(6) No connection shall be made at any time between a tap or
outlet furnishing potable water on any premises and any
container or equipment holding material by any means other
than an open connection.
F. The license fee for renewal of a current septage hauler's permit as
required herein is to be established in accordance with the
requirements of the Charter. No permits are to be issued to any
new applicants. All permits to be issued will be to an individual,
corporation or firm on file for the year preceding the permit
renewal date. A new applicant may obtain a license by purchase of
the business of a licensed hauler whose license is current and valid.
The new license will be limited to that annual volume of waste
previously disposed of at the plant under the license purchased.
This assumption of the business by a new owner limits the area of
collection to those townships, boroughs, villages, towns and other
governmental boundaries which are serviced by the integrated
sewer system served by the City of Allentown. The term of the
license shall be from June 1 to May 31 of the succeeding year.
G. The fee for disposal into the City Sewage Treatment Plant, at the
location designated, shall be established in accordance with the
requirements of the Charter and shall be based on a rate per 1,000
gallons, or a portion thereof.
H. An application form shall be filled out by the hauler, operator,
owner, person or persons, prior to the conducting of such a
business within the City as governed in this section. The
application form shall contain the following information:
(1) Name and address of owner, operator, hauler, person or
persons.
(2) Date of the license issued.
§ 18-407 SALISBURY CODE § 18-407
FWD:412
(3) The fee for the license as required herein to be established in
accordance with the requirements of this Part.
(4) Term of the license: From June 1 to May 31 of the succeeding
year.
(5) The size and make of truck, containers, etc., stated in gallons.
(6) Place of storage, garage or parking of trucks, containers, etc.,
when not in use.
(7) License cannot be transferred from one operator, owner,
person or persons to another without approval by the City.
(8) A statement to the effect that such trucks, containers,
equipment, etc., will be available for inspection by the person
designated to make inspection from the City at such time and
place agreeable to both hauler and inspector.
(9) Refusal of agreement to these conditions of inspection at a
reasonable time can be cause for forfeiture of the license.
(10) A higher fee per load, container or portion thereof can be
charged, if the need for processing, extra analyses, etc., shall
be necessary.
(11) If a tank or container contains more than 1,000 gallons, an
additional fee shall be charged for each 1,000 gallons
additional, or portion thereof. The additional fee, as required
herein, is to be established in accordance with the
requirements of this Part.
(12) It shall be understood by all applicants for a permit or those
having a license that the septage haulers' permits are an
extended courtesy by the City and upon 60 days notification by
the City can be terminated if there is reasonable cause for such
type action or there is a necessity to reduce the volume of
materials to allow the City to comply with its effluent
limitations for discharge to the Lehigh River or for any other
functional activity at the wastewater treatment plant
operations, which would require a reduction in the septage
volume being processed.
I. Failure to secure a license, permit or pay dumping fees, when
required, as governed in this section or operating after suspension

(June and December), or on dates specified, reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are
limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the Director of
Public Works or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the user.
B. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Subsection 13 of this section.
C. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
D. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Director of Public Works, using the
procedures prescribed in Subsections 9 and 10 of this section, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
E. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
F. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling
location more frequently than required by the Director of Public
Works, using the procedures prescribed in Subsection 10 of this
section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.

discharge permit under § 18-409, Subsection 7, of this Part or
modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§ 18-409, Subsection 4, of this Part in response to changed
conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
B. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, loading
increases of 20% or more for pollutants, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
6. Reports of Potential Problems.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the Township and/or POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Director of Public Works of
the incident. This notification shall include the location of the
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Director of Public Works, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage,
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
Township and/or POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed

performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Director of Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director of Public Works
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by
the industrial user is not required if the City performs sampling at the
user's facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling at
the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and
the time when the user or the City receives the results of this sampling,
or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user.
9. Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines
that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed
by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Director of Public Works or other parties approved by the EPA.
10. Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on
data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
A. Except as indicated in Subsection 10B and C below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Director of Public Works. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Township and/or
City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR
Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited
§ 18-410 FOREWORD § 18-410
FWD:427
prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in
the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples
may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by
the Township and/or City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports required in Subsections 1 and 3 of
this section [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for
which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Director of Public Works
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
Subsection 4 of this section [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and ensure compliance by with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
11. Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been
submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
12. Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part
4 shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this Part 4 and any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with
best management practices established under § 18-406, Subsection 4C.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These
records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user or the Township and/or the City, or where the user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Director of Public Works.
13. Certification Statements.

2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/2017]
This compliance certification is based on the following
information.
__________
14. Hazardous Waste Reporting. Although discharges of hazardous wastes
are specifically prohibited in § 18-406, Subsection 1B(18), if any user
accidentally discharges a hazardous waste, the reporting requirements
at 40 CFR 403.12(p)(1) shall be adhered to.
1. Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling. The Director of Public Works
shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine
whether the user is complying with all requirements of this Part and any
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the Director of Public Works ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination
and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Director of
Public Works will be permitted to enter without delay for the
purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The Director of Public Works shall have the right to set up on the
user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's
operations.
C. The Director of Public Works may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All
devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director
of Public Works and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this Part.
2. Search Warrants. If the Director of Public Works has been refused
access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a

§ 18-412. Confidential Information. [Ord. No. 08-2010-561, 8/12/
2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/2017]
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Director of Public Works inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report
that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.
§ 18-413. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance. [Ord.
No. 08-2010-561, 8/12/2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613,
9/14/2017]
violation of this Part, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as
part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Township or
City designed to verify compliance with this Part or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Director of Public Works may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate issuing authority.
1. The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in a newspaper of
general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the
jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or
any other industrial user that violates Subsection 1C, D or H of this
section) and shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the
same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed
(by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in § 18-406;
§ 18-411 FOREWORD § 18-413
FWD:431
§ 18-414. Administrative Enforcement Remedies. [Ord. No.
08-2010-561, 8/12/2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/
2017]
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits as defined by § 18-406 multiplied by
the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and
1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by § 18-406 (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the Director of
Public Works determines has caused, alone or in combination with
other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of the Township and/or POTW personnel or
the general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted
in the Director of Public Works exercising his emergency authority
to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the Director of Public Works
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of
the local pretreatment program.
1. Notification of Violation. When the Director of Public Works finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works of
the Township or POTW may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within 20 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the
§ 18-413 SALISBURY CODE § 18-414
FWD:432
user to the Director of Public Works. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before
or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall
limit the authority of the Director of Public Works to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
2. Consent Order. The Director of Public Works may enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken
by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified
by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections 4 and 5 of
this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
3. Show-Cause Hearing. The Director of Public Works may order a user
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part 4,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director of
Public Works and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the
reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A
show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
4. Compliance Orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part 4, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user
does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service
may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
§ 18-414 FOREWORD § 18-414
FWD:433
5. Cease-and-Desist Orders. When the Director of Public Works finds that
a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations
are likely to recur, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
6. Administrative Fines.
A. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public
Works may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000
regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such penalties shall be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or
other long-term average discharge limits, penalty shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation. The penalties may be
assessed whether or not the violation was willful or negligent.
B. Notice of assessment of penalty shall state the appeal process to be
followed, including the name, address and telephone number of the
person responsible for accepting such appeal. Said notice shall also
contain the date or dates of violation, the permit requirement that
was violated, and the amount of penalty assessed. The notice shall
state the time frame for appeal. It shall be served personally on the
violator or shall be sent by certified mail to the address of the
permit holder as noted on the permit.
C. The penalty shall be assessed in accordance with the Chart for
Assessment, below, which sets forth the Township's/City of
Allentown's assessment policy considering damage to air, water,
land or other natural resources, cost of restoration and abatement,
savings resulting to the person for the violation, history of past
violations, deterrence of future violations and other relevant
factors.

Other Factors Will Be Considered
Other factors which may be considered include, but are not
limited to: damage to POTW, willfulness or concealment,
endangerment to the public and/or POTW personnel.
Points shall be assessed for a violation in accordance with the
above chart which constitutes the Township's and the City of
Allentown's assessment policy.
Points shall be totaled and the fine shall be assessed as follows:
Number of Points Penalty
25 $25,000
20 $20,000
15 $15,000
10 $10,000
5 $5,000
The assessment of penalties may include numbers which are not
whole, such as 1.5, to allow flexibility and discretion by the
Director of Public Works in arriving at a fair and appropriate
penalty. The above listed fine shall be then prorated to reflect the
less-than-whole number of points assessed.
Example: Total Points = 12.5
Civil Penalty = $12,500
E. All fines collected shall be placed in restricted accounts and shall
only be used by the Township and/or City of Allentown, depending
§ 18-414 FOREWORD § 18-414
FWD:435
upon which has sustained damage to its facilities and/or
environment and in what proportion, to repair damage and provide
for additional maintenance and costs as a result of violations, to
pay penalties imposed by any local, state or federal government for
violation of pretreatment standards, for the costs of investigation
and enforcement action, for monitoring of discharge in the
pretreatment program and for capital improvement to the POTW.
F. Any party seeking to appeal the assessment of a fine shall do so by
filing a notice of appeal with the Director of Public Works within 30
days after receipt or service of said notice. The Appeal Board shall
hear all such appeals. A transcript shall be made of said hearing at
the sole expense of the appellant. The appellant shall pay the cost
of appeal and the sum for estimate of stenographer bills at the time
of filing said appeal. Failure to pay said sums at the time of filing
shall make the appeal void. After the hearing, any additional
stenographer charges shall be billed to the appellant and shall be
paid in full within 10 days of receipt or appeal shall be null and void
ab initio. The Appeals Board shall either affirm the decision of the
Director of Public Works or reverse or modify the same as the
substantial evidence indicates in accordance with the assessment
policy adopted by the Township and the City. Appeals from the
decision of the Appeals Board shall be in accordance with state law.
G. Each permit holder shall keep the Township and City apprised, in
writing, of any change in mailing address. The address on the
permit shall be used to send all correspondence and notice of civil
assessment to permit holders. The sending of a notice of civil
assessment to a permit holder's address on permit shall
conclusively be presumed to be valid service; thus, if the certified
mail sent to such address is not accepted or picked up by the
permit holder, the date of service shall be the date that the certified
mail was rejected or returned unclaimed.
H. The Township and City shall charge all costs for reestablishing the
operation of the publicly owned treatment works after a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement. These costs shall be
paid by the user within 10 days after notice of assessment of the
same. Notice and appeal rights shall be the same as in the case of
assessment of civil penalties. Any user not paying said assessment
shall pay an additional penalty of 5% of the penalty per month or
any part thereof.
I. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
7. Emergency Suspensions.
§ 18-414 SALISBURY CODE § 18-414
FWD:436
A. The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge,
which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Director of Public Works may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens
to interfere with the operation of the Township and/or POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Director of Public Works may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the
Township and/or POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment
to any individuals. The Director of Public Works may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public
Works that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in Subsection 8 of this section are
initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the Director of Public Works prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under Subsection 3 or 8
of this section.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
8. Termination of Discharge.
A. In addition to the provisions in Subsection 6 of this section, any
user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;

12/2010; as amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/2017]
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 18-406 of this Part.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
Subsection 3 of this section why the proposed action should not be
taken. Exercise of this option by the Director of Public Works shall
not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.
1. Injunctive Relief. When the Director of Public Works for the Township or
POTW finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director of Public Works for the Township and/or POTW may petition
the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas for the issuance of a
restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater
discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Part on
activities of the user. The Director of Public Works may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including
a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against a user.
2. Civil Penalties.
A. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall be liable to the Township, the City, or both, for a maximum
civil penalty to each of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of
a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B. The Director of Public Works may recover reasonable attorneys'
fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the
cost of any actual damages incurred by the Township and/or City.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and
duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the
user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance
history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.

2017]
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
3. Criminal Prosecution.
A. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a summary offense, punishable by a fine of
not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for
not more than 90 days, or both.
B. A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a
penalty of at least $1,000 or be subject to imprisonment for not
more than 90 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under state law.
C. A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
Part, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any

2017]
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable
to the Township and City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined
by the Director of Public Works to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
2. Liability Insurance. The Director of Public Works may decline to issue
or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the
Township and/or POTW caused by its discharge.
3. Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will
recommence, at the user's expense, only after the user has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
4. Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to
receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the
Township. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the
Township held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the
discretion of the Director of Public Works.
1. Upset.
A. For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does
not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection 1C below are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
§ 18-416 SALISBURY CODE § 18-417
FWD:440
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the
Director of Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five days);
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility
is reduced, lost, or fails.
2. Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance
with the general prohibitions in § 18-406, Subsection 1A, of this Part or
the specific prohibitions in § 18-406, Subsection 1B(3) through (17) of
this Part if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that
its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
Township and/or City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES
§ 18-417 FOREWORD § 18-417
FWD:441
permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with
applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements.
3. Bypass.
A. For the purpose of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does
not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if
it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsection 3C
and D of this section.
C. Bypass Notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Director of Public Works, at least 10
days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works
of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also
be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director of Public
Works may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
§ 18-417 SALISBURY CODE § 18-417

§ 18-418. Hearing Board. [Ord. No. 08-2010-561, 8/12/2010; as
amended by Ord. No. 09-2017-613, 9/14/2017]
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods
of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate backup equipment should have been installed
in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection
3C of this section.
(2) The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director of
Public Works determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in Subsection 3D(1) of this section.
1. Establishment of Hearing Board. A hearing board consisting of five

GREASE TRAPS
§ 18-701. Scope and Purpose. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/2011, § I]
To aid in the prevention of contributions, discharges, and accumulation
of fats, oils and greases into the system from industrial or commercial
facilities, including but not limited to, food preparation and serving facilities
and automobile service stations which may result in the delivery of
"exceptional strength wastewater" (as that term is used in a multimunicipality
agreement dated December 29, 1981, in which Salisbury
Township is a signatory) to the Allentown Wastewater Treatment Plant;
to regulate such contributions, discharges and accumulations through a
permitting process; and to properly assess the costs associated with the
monitoring and regulation of such facilities, and the treatment of fats, oils
and greases delivered to the system.
§ 18-702. Definitions. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/2011, § II]
EXCEPTIONAL STRENGTH WASTEWATER  Waste water which, at the
time it enters the Township System, exceeds one or more of the following
strength parameters:
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) 230 mg/l
Suspended Solids (SS) 250 mg/l
Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TJN) 44 mg/l
FOOD SERVICE FACILITY  A facility or establishment, other than a single
family residential dwelling, regularly engaged in activities of preparing or
serving or otherwise making food available for consumption which uses
one or more of the following preparation techniques: cooking by frying
(all methods); baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking,
broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching.
Also included as a technique and for purposes of this definition are infrared
heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity which
produces a non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires
washing. These facilities include restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels,
hospitals, nursing homes, schools, grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches,
camps, caterers, concessions, manufacturing plants, or any other industrial
or commercial establishments, except residential establishments, which
discharge, or are likely to discharge, grease into the system.
GREASE  Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease from animal
or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil, and grease may be used
interchangeably in this Part 7 under this single definition.
GREASE TRAP OR INTERCEPTOR  A device for separating and retaining
waterborne grease and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting
the trap and entering the system. These devices also serve to collect
settlable solids, generated by and from food preparation and other activities
which discharge grease, prior to water exiting the trap and entering the
§ 18-701 FOREWORD § 18-702
FWD:459
system. The grease trap/interceptor shall be properly sized to handle the
expected flow from the facility.
OIL/WATER SEPARATOR  A device that is specifically designed and
manufactured to separate oil from water, and permits the oil to be collected
and removed on a regular basis as to prevent it from being discharged into
the system. The oil/water separator shall be properly sized to handle the
expected flow from the facility.
OPERATION  Any activity which results in the discharge by a regulated
facility of any wastewater into the system.
REGULATED FACILITY  Any food service facility and any other
commercial establishment of Township, except residential, which
contributes, discharges or accumulates grease which enters the system, or
which discharges waste into the system of the types described in § 18-407,
Subsection 2, of the Salisbury Township Codified Ordinances, Chapter 18,
Part 4.
SYSTEM  The sanitary sewerage collection system of Salisbury Township.
USER  Any person or establishment including those located outside the
jurisdictional limits of Salisbury Township who or which contributes,
causes, or permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the
system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile
sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
§ 18-703. Industrial Waste Discharge Permits. [Ord. 10-2011-569,
10/13/2011, § III]
1. When Required.
A. Existing Facilities. Each regulated facility shall obtain an industrial
waste discharge permit from Township in accordance with the
requirements as described in § 18-408 of the Salisbury Township
Codified Ordinances, Chapter 18, Part 4. This permit, if not sooner
obtained, shall be acquired by each such user no later than June 1,
2012. From and after June 1, 2012, no Township customer
described in this paragraph shall discharge into the system without
a valid unrevoked permit for each regulated facility.
B. Renovated and Altered Facilities. Each regulated facility which is
altered or renovated in a manner which in any way affects the
nature or composition of its sewerage discharge, or which alters its
sewage discharge lines or facilities, or any monitoring or collection
devices associated therewith, shall be required to obtain a new
industrial waste discharge permit.
C. New Facilities. From and after June 1, 2012, no use which when
placed in operation will constitute a regulated facility may
commence operation without an industrial waste discharge permit.
2. Transfer of Permits. Any changes in control or ownership of a regulated
facility will require the issuances of a new permit before the
§ 18-702 SALISBURY CODE § 18-703
FWD:460
§ 18-704. Grease Traps Required. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/2011,
§ IV]
§ 18-705. Sampling Port Required. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/2011,
§ VI]
commencement of operations under such new control or ownership.
Each new user or operator shall be responsible for notifying Township
of a change in control or ownership.
3. Duration. An industrial waste discharge permit shall, if not revoked,
expire three years after the issuance date. Permits may be revoked for
non-compliance with the provisions of this or any other Township
ordinance, or for non-payment of user fees, monitoring costs, industrial
waste surcharges, or service fees.
4. Cost. The cost of an industrial waste discharge permit shall be
established from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners, to be determined in a manner consistent with Part 4 of
the Salisbury Township Codified Ordinance. The initial permit fee shall
be $300. Permit fees shall be adequate to pay the reasonable cost to
Township of the monitoring, sampling flow measurement, testing and
inspection required by § 18-705 of this Part 7, and of administering the
Township permitting program. Regulated facilities which operate
without an industrial waste discharge permit at any time subsequent to
June 1, 2012, shall be assessed and shall pay a service charge of $100
for each day of unpermitted operation. Township shall amend the fees
and costs of this Part 7 by resolution.
5. Property Rights. Each issuance of a permit does not convey any
property right to the permittee.
1. Each food service and regulated facility which operates more than 15
days in any calendar month shall install, regularly dispose of material
from, and properly monitor grease traps for damage to assure that they
properly function. Any regulated facility which does not utilize a
properly functioning grease trap as of the date of the adoption of this
Part 7 shall install such a grease trap on or before June 1, 2012. Unless
determined to be infeasible by the Township, any grease trap installed
subsequent to the adoption of this Part 7 shall be located outside the
portion of the facility in which grease is introduced into sanitary sewer
discharge lines, and shall be accessible through a manhole with a
minimum diameter of 24 inches with a readily removable cover. A
separate monitoring location shall be provided downstream of the
grease trap. Grease trap/interceptors shall be properly sized to handle
the expected flow from the facility.
2. No regulated facility shall be renovated, altered, opened or reopened
after the date of this Part 7 without a grease trap which meets the
criteria of this section.
§ 18-703 FOREWORD § 18-705
FWD:461
§ 18-706. Sampling, Flow Measurement, Testing and Inspection.
[Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/2011, § VI]
1. Each regulated facility which operates more than five days in a calendar
month shall install or provide a sampling port on the discharge side of
each grease trap installed and maintained in accordance with the prior
section of this Part 7. Any regulated facility which does not possess a
sampling port which adequately permits the sampling, flow
measurement, testing and inspection required by § 18-706 of this Part
7, shall install such a sampling port on or before June 1, 2012. The
sampling port must permit the collection of representative samples of
the wastewater discharge of each regulated facility before the samples
reach the system, and in a manner which provides sufficient volume for
thorough chemical analysis.
2. No regulated facility shall be renovated, altered, opened or reopened
after the date of this Part 7 without a sampling port which meets the
criteria of this section.
1. The permittee of each regulated facility which operates more than five
days in any calendar month shall sample its wastewater discharge in
accordance with this section, and shall provide a discharge monitoring
report to Township not less frequently than semi-annually, with reports
to be submitted no later than June 30 and December 31 of each
calendar year. Each discharge monitoring report shall specify the date
and time of sampling. Each regulated facility shall meet the sampling
and reporting requirements of this section not later than June 30, 2012.
2. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this Part 7 shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods
for Examination of Water and Waste Water," published by the American
Public Health Association and shall be determined at the sample port
provided by the required facility, upon suitable samples taken at such
sample port. In the event that no sample port has yet been installed, the
sampling location shall be the nearest downstream manhole in the
system to the point at which the regulated facility sewer is connected.
In the event that a system manhole is used as the sampling site, the
manhole may be used by permittees for such sampling only, but no
permittee or representative of permittee may physically enter the
system. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods
to reflect the effect of discharged materials upon the system and the
Allentown Wastewater Treatment Facility and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all
outfalls of a regulated facility are appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples must also be taken.
3. Both the owner and the operator of each regulated facility connected to
the system shall be jointly and severally responsible to provide
Township and its representatives and agents the opportunity of access
§ 18-705 SALISBURY CODE § 18-706
FWD:462
at any time to any part of any regulated facility served by the system
as shall be required for purposes of inspection, measurement, sampling
and testing and for performance of other functions relating to service
rendered by Township in regard to the system.
4. All sampling shall be accomplished and all discharge monitoring
reports shall be submitted by qualified individuals acceptable to
Township. Well defined chain-of-custody and record keeping methods
acceptable to Township shall be employed.
5. Discharge reports shall not only characterize the nature of wastewater
samples taken, but shall also describe the condition of, and cleanliness
of each grease trap. At no time may the combined grease and settled
solids of any grease trap exceed 25% of the depth of the grease trap.
Discharge reports shall also identify each date and time material was
removed from a grease trap since the last report. The report shall state
with specificity the qualified and licensed person or entity who or which
disposed of material from the grease trap, shall include written
certifications as to what was removed, the lawful disposition of the
materials removed, and the location of their disposal.
6. Material shall be removed from grease traps before the combined
grease and settled solids accumulate to a depth of 25% of the total
depth of the grease trap, and not less frequently than once every 90
days. Disposal of all removed material shall be accomplished by a
qualified and licensed person or entity. Cleaning shall include removal
of all floating material, wastewater, grease and settled solids.
Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the grease trap,
or otherwise into the system, is prohibited.
7. A maintenance log regarding the cleaning of each grease trap shall be
maintained by each regulated facility for a period of at least the prior 36
consecutive months. The log shall include the date, time, amount
pumped, the identity of the hauler and the disposal location, and shall
be made available to the Township promptly upon request.
8. Monitoring Costs. To the extent that permit fees do not fully
compensate Township for their monitoring of the information to be
supplied by permittee, and for independent sampling and testing, if any
is accomplished by Township, such costs will be assessed against the
permittee as monitored. Permittees may be assessed progressively
higher charges for monitoring, testing and sampling accomplished
following each instance in which a permittee is non-compliant with
Township regulatory requirements including introducing exceptional
strength wastewater into the system. Such progressive charges shall be
established by Township from time to time by separate ordinance.

FWD:463
§ 18-707. Sand, Soil, and Oil Interceptors. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/
13/2011, § VII]
All car washes, truck washes, garages, service stations, car and truck
maintenance facilities, fabricators, utility equipment shops, and other
facilities identified by Township as likely sources of sand, soil and oil shall
install effective sand, soil and oil traps, interceptors, and/or oil/water
separators. These separators shall be sized to effectively remove sand,
soil, and oil at expected flow rates. These separators shall, at the user's
expense, be regularly cleaned or pumped to prevent any adverse impact
upon the system. Users whose systems are deemed to be ineffective by
Township shall change the cleaning frequency or shall increase the size or
methodology of the separator. Owners or operators of washing facilities are
required to prevent the inflow of detergents and rainwater into the system.
Sampling locations shall be provided by all such users no later than June 1,
2012.
§ 18-708. Excess Strength Charges. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/2011,
§ VIII]
Excess strength charges shall be levied by Township against any owner
or operator of any operation which discharges exceptional strength waste
water into the system. The Township charge shall be equal to the
exceptional strength load determined through monitoring times the
estimated quarterly rates charged by the City of Allentown to Township plus
a 10% administrative fee.
§ 18-709. Alteration of Control Methods. [Ord. 10-2011-569, 10/13/
2011, § IX]
Township reserves the right to request additional control measures if
existing control, sampling, measurement, testing or inspection systems can
be demonstrated by Township to be insufficient to protect the system or
the Allentown Wastewater Treatment Facility from damages due to grease,
sand, soil, oil or other discharges, or if a permittee's efforts to eliminate
excess strength discharges are unsuccessful.
§ 18-710. Noncompliance, Fines and Penalties. [Ord. 10-2011-569,
10/13/2011, § X]
1. Any owner or operator which refuses or fails to comply with the
requirements of this Part 7 shall, following a thirty-day notice of its
noncompliance, either cease all wastewater discharges into the system,
or shall, at the option of Township, suffer a discontinuance of water
services, and shall be subject to all other remedies available to
Township at law or in equity, or both. Such owner or operator may also
be subject to fines and penalties levied by the Township. Each owner
and operator of a regulated facility shall be deemed to have joint and
severable liability and responsibility under the provisions of this Part 7.

MSW services commence until the start of the next following
quarterly MSW billing, at the sole discretion of the Township, and
may be included on the following quarterly MSW billing.
7. Dishonored Payment.
A. If any check, money order, credit card, or similar type of payment
for MSW charges or MSW billings is returned marked "uncollected"
or similarly for any reason, including, but not limited to, insufficient
funds, refusal to honor the payment, closed account, or lack of valid
signature, etc., then an additional service fee for handling and
rebilling shall become an additional MSW charge against that
property, and shall be paid as provided herein.
B. The amount of this additional MSW charge shall be established as
part of a fee schedule adopted by a resolution of the Board of

connection with the collection of municipal solid waste, which rules and
regulations shall be and shall become a part of this Part 3.

from hauling his/her own such waste on an irregular and unscheduled
basis, to a state-permitted disposal site.
2. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a farmer from carrying out the
normal activities of his/her farming operation, including composting
and the spreading of manure or other farm produced agricultural
wastes.
3. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to anything but the storage,
collection, transportation, disposal and recycling of municipal solid
waste; they do not apply, therefore, to hazardous or residual wastes as
defined by the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act.

including, but not limited to: (A) the failure to use adequate containers
or recycling bins, (B) the placement of containers or recycling bins in
inappropriate locations for collection, (C) placing containers or
recycling bins out too early for collection, (D) failure to take in
containers or recycling bins by the appropriate time, (E) mixing leaf
waste in with municipal waste or recyclables, (F) failure to separate all
recyclables from other waste for collection, (G) scavenging recyclables
placed out for collection, shall be subject to a fine of up to $500, plus
costs, and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Township, or
imprisoned for a period of up to 30 days, or both. Each day such a
violation occurs, and each residential establishment for or on which it
occurs, shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of this Part.
2. Remedies. In addition to the foregoing penalty, the Township may
require the owner or occupant of a residential establishment to remove
any accumulation of municipal waste from that establishment, and
should said person fail to remove and adequately dispose of or recycle
such solid waste within five days following receipt of written notice to
do so, said failure shall constitute a violation of this Part. Further, the
Township may at the end of said five-day period cause the municipal
waste to be collected and disposed of or recycled, in which event the
owner or occupant of the subject establishment shall reimburse the
Township for all costs and expenses incurred by it in said removal and
disposition.

This Part provides an overview of the general procedure for the Township
review of proposed subdivisions and land developments (§ 22-302) and of
the general procedures for submitting plans to the Township (§ 22-303).
This Part is intended to be instructional and exemplary only and does not
set forth mandatory requirements which are binding on the Township or an
applicant.
§ 22-302. General Procedure for Subdivisions and Land
Developments.
1. Review and Approval Stages:
A. Four types of plan submission are included in the procedure for
approval of subdivision and land development plans: sketch,
preliminary, final and preliminary/final.
B. These plans enable the Planning Commission and the Board of
Commissioners to have an adequate opportunity to review the
submission and to ensure that their formal recommendations are
reflected in the final plan which is recorded.
C. The table below outlines the stages for the different types of
proposed subdivision or land development.

2. Sketch Plan.
A. While sketch plans are not required, it is recommended that they
be submitted for major subdivision and land development plans so
as to allow the applicant to consult early and informally with the
Planning Commission and, in some circumstances, with the Board
of Commissioners, before preparing a preliminary and/or final plan
in an effort to resolve potential development difficulties and avoid
unnecessary engineering and other expense and delay.
B. Comments made by the Planning Commissions and/or Board of
Commissioners on the sketch plan are only recommendations and
are not binding.
3. Preliminary Plan: Major Subdivisions and Land Development.
A. Except for any sketch plan which is submitted, the initial plan
submitted for formal review of a major subdivision or land
development shall be considered the official preliminary plan.
B. The purpose of the preliminary plan is to achieve formal approval of
the overall development scheme proposed in order to minimize the
need for any revisions of final plans.
4. Final Plan: Major Subdivisions and Land Developments.
A. After approval of the preliminary plan of a major subdivision or
land development, the applicant submits a final plan.
B. The purpose of the final plan is to obtain formal approval before
plans for all major subdivisions and land developments are
recorded.
5. Preliminary/Final Plan; Minor Subdivisions, Resubdivisions, and Lot
Consolidations.
A. The applicant submits a preliminary/final minor subdivision plan or
a preliminary/final resubdivision plan or a preliminary/final lot
consolidation plan to the Planning Commission.
B. The purpose of the preliminary/final plan is to secure formal
approval by the Planning Commission, as the sole reviewing and
approving body, before plans for minor subdivisions,
resubdivisions, or lot consolidations are recorded.
§ 22-302 SALISBURY CODE § 22-302
FWD:532
6. Guarantee of Improvements Installation. Before approving any
subdivision or land development plan for recording, the Board of
Commissioners shall require that the Township be assured (by means of
a proper developer's improvements agreement with performance
guarantee) that the improvements required by this Part will
subsequently be installed in strict compliance with the standards and
specifications of this Part.

SKETCH PLAN
§ 22-401. Purpose. [Ord. 6-97-429, 6/12/1997, § 4.1]
The purpose of the sketch plan is to establish in advance the overall
objectives of the applicant, the extent to which the proposed plan conforms
with the provisions of this Part, and if such plan qualifies as a minor or major
subdivision or a land development. Although sketch plans are not required
under this Part, it is recommended that sketch plans be submitted for
major subdivisions and land development in an effort to avoid unnecessary
engineering and other expense and delay in the subsequent review of more
detailed preliminary plans and final plans. Comments made on the sketch
plan are only recommendations and are not binding.
§ 22-402. Submission and Review Procedure. [Ord. 6-97-429, 6/12/
1997, § 4.2]
1. Submission.
A. Copies of a sketch plan for a proposed subdivision or land
development may be submitted to the Township by the applicant,

delivering the financial security, or to an amount not exceeding 110%,
(or such other amount specified in the MPC as it may hereafter be
amended), of the cost of completing the required improvements as
reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year

FWD:587
site design to avoid increased traffic congestion and promote public
safety:
A. The use of marginal access or reverse frontage streets for access
only onto side or interior streets, to collect traffic from numerous
driveways and direct it to a select few number of entrances to the
arterial street.
B. The minimization of the number of driveway cuts or street
intersections onto an arterial street, which may include requiring
the use of shared driveways between adjacent uses or lots.
C. The restriction of ingress and egress involving left-hand turns onto
or off of the arterial street.
D. The prohibition of driveways from individual dwellings entering
directly onto an arterial street.

Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
9. Streets With Only One Outlet.
A. Dead-end streets, other than stub and cul-de-sac streets, shall be
prohibited, except as hereinafter provided.
B. Stub Streets.
(1) All stub streets of abutting subdivisions shall be incorporated
into the proposed street system of a subdivision or land
development.
(2) Stub streets shall be less than 250 feet in length measured
from the intersection of the center lines of the stub and
intersecting streets to the termination of the stub street and
shall be provided with a temporary turnaround to the
standards required for culs-de-sac. The use of such turnaround
shall be guaranteed to the public and appropriate easements
or rights-of-way shall be provided and documented for the
turnaround on the plan(s) to be recorded.

width between the edge of the cartway and the edge of the
right-of-way along the stem of the street leading to the cul-desac
bulb shall be maintained around the cul-de-sac bulb.
(2) The paving of the cul-de-sac bulb shall join the approach road
paving by an arc having a radius of not less than 25 feet.
(3) The Board of Commissioners, with consideration of the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, may permit
acceptable alternative turnaround designs, including
turnarounds with acceptable radii having a parking court or a
landscaped island (with acceptable provisions for private
maintenance) within the cul-de-sac bulb.
§ 22-1004 SALISBURY CODE § 22-1004
FWD:590

minimum of 1%.
(6) Cul-de-sac streets shall have a maximum length of 600 feet and
furnish access to not more than 15 single family dwelling units
including corner lots whether or not they front on the cul-desac.
For every 50 feet of cul-de-sac length proposed which is
greater than the six-hundred-foot length permitted, there shall
be a corresponding reduction of one permitted dwelling unit.
For instance, a permitted cul-de-sac of 650 feet in length shall
be permitted a maximum of 14 dwelling units, a sevenhundred-
foot cul-de-sac is permitted a maximum of 13 dwelling
units, etc. The maximum number of dwelling units refers to all
dwelling units on a cul-de-sac, existing and proposed, not just
the number of dwelling units within the proposed subdivision.
(7) The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the
center of the cul-de-sac bulb to the point of center-line
intersection of the cul-de-sac to an approved through street.
For any cul-de-sac that ends in a loop rather than a bulb, the
length of total roadway measured along its center line should
not exceed the permitted cul-de-sac length.
10. Service Streets.
A. Service streets are prohibited in all residential subdivisions.
B. Service streets may be permitted in a nonresidential development,
provided that the subdivider or developer produces evidence
satisfactory to the Township demonstrating the need for such
service streets.
C. No part of any structure shall be located within 20 feet of the
center lines of a service street.
D. Dead-end service streets shall be avoided, but where this is
demonstrated to be impossible, dead-end service streets shall
terminate with a paved circular turnaround constructed to
Township specifications with a minimum radius to the outer
pavement edge (curb line) of 50 feet.
E. Service street intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall
be avoided, but where necessary, shall be designed to public street
local road standards to permit safe vehicular circulation.
11. Street Design and Construction Standards.
A. General. Streets shall be graded, improved and surfaced to the
grades and dimensions shown on the plans, profiles and cross
§ 22-1004 FOREWORD § 22-1004
FWD:591
sections submitted by the developer and approved by the Board of
Commissioners.
B. Right-of-Way Grading.
(1) The entire right-of-way width shall be graded to the approved
cross-section. All obstructions including, but not limited to,
trees, stumps and other material deemed unsuitable by the
Township Engineer shall be removed. The excavation shall be
backfilled and suitably compacted to the satisfaction of the
Township Engineer.
(2) The typical street section shall be crowned.
(3) Properly super-elevated curves (banked curves) shall be
provided on arterial and collector streets and when required by
the Township Engineer.
C. Grading Beyond Right-of-way.
(1) The subdivider or developer may be required to grade beyond
the right-of-way line in order to provide continuous slope from
the proposed right-of-way line elevation to the existing
elevation of the abutting property.
(2) Such grading beyond the right-of-way shall maintain the
original drainage patterns except where stormwater runoff
designs dictate or warrant improvement or alteration of the
original slope and contours.
(3) Approved plans, either preliminary or final, showing proposed
grading, shall contain a note on the plan, which note shall state
that the grading proposed on the plan shall be maintained, and
that the note constitutes a covenant running with the land
enforceable by the Township and binding upon the developer,
his heirs, executors, administrators, successors-in-title,
successors, and/or assigns, unless altered by written
permission from the Board of Commissioners after
recommendation from the Lehigh County Conservation
District.
(4) In areas of earth excavation or earth fill, such grading shall be
done to the maximum extent practical at a slope of four feet
horizontal to one-foot vertical. If steeper slopes are required,
permanent ground stabilization shall be accomplished with a
maintenance free planting.
D. Drainage of Streets.
(1) Parallel and cross drainage facilities shall be properly located,
designed and installed to maintain proper drainage of the
completed streets.
§ 22-1004 SALISBURY CODE § 22-1004
FWD:592
(2) Proper design may require the use of curb and gutter or paved
drainage swales to prevent erosion. Drainage facilities shall be
designed in accordance with requirements of § 22-1010.
(3) Open pipe ends must be fitted with concrete end walls or
prefabricated end sections and with protective safety gratings.
(4) No open pipes shall be allowed to end within the Township
street right-of-way, except in cases where new or existing
driveways must cross deep swales adjacent to new or existing
Township roads. In the case of these exceptions to the
standard, the pipe shall be located as far off the edge of
pavement as possible, and at least 20 feet from the road center
line.
(5) Energy dissipaters shall be placed at the outlets of all pipes
where flow velocities exceed maximum permitted for the
proposed channel lining.
(6) Consideration shall be given for subgrade drainage of those
soils subject to frost heave. Design of the road bed in such
locations may require parallel drainage facilities and/or
underdrains to properly stabilize the subgrade. The Board of
Commissioners may require that such drainage facilities be
provided. The requirement and design of such subgrade
drainage facilities shall be subject to the recommendation,
review and approval of the Township Engineer.
12. Required Traffic Improvements.
A. Purpose. In recognition of the provisions of the Article V-A and
§ 503(2)(ii) and 503(3) of the MPC, this section is primarily
intended to ensure that streets bordering a subdivision or land
development are coordinated and of such widths and grades and in
such locations as deemed necessary to accommodate prospective
traffic and to facilitate fire protection and to ensure that the access
into and out of subdivisions and land developments is sufficiently
safe.
B. Process. Determinations under this Subsection 12 shall be made by
the Board of Commissioners, after considering any
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the Township
Engineer, the applicant, the applicant's professional
representatives, any comments from PennDOT that may be
provided regarding a state road and any professional traffic studies
that may have been submitted.
C. On-Site Traffic Improvements. An applicant for a subdivision or
land development shall be required to pay for and install, at his own
expense, all requested on-site improvements as defined in Article VA,
§ 502-A of the MPC. On-site improvements may include, but are
not limited to, a new traffic signal or traffic control devices, the

development or subdivision shall be required to widen the cartway
and any shoulders of abutting streets to Township standards (or
other specifications approved by the Board of Commissioners or
PennDOT) and to a width determined to be adequate by the Board
of Commissioners as reasonably related to, and necessitated by, the
land development or subdivision for the public health, safety, and
welfare. The applicant shall only be responsible for improvements
from the center line of the street right-of-way inward toward the
project's lot lines, unless the Board of Commissioners determine
that improvements on the other side of the center line are
reasonably related to, and necessitated by the subdivision or land
development for ingress and egress and are essential for public
safety.
13. Maintenance of Private Streets. Where private streets are permitted
under the Township Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall enter into a
legally binding agreement (which agreement shall be recorded in the
Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Lehigh County) specifying who shall
be responsible for the improvement and perpetual maintenance of any
private street as a condition of final plan approval.
14. Street Names.
A. A proposed street which is obviously in alignment with an existing
named street shall bear the name of the existing street unless
separated by an arterial street, in which case the proposed street
may bear the name of the existing street.

radial to curved street lines.
B. Lot lines should follow municipal boundaries rather than cross
them in order to avoid jurisdictional problems.
C. The depth of residential lots should be not less than one nor more
than 2 1/2 times their width.
2. Lot Frontage.
A. All lots shall have frontage on a public street improved to Township
standards, or for which such improvements have been insured by
the posting of an acceptable performance guarantee under this
chapter. Where permitted in the Township Zoning Ordinance
[Chapter 27] (e.g., townhouses and condominium apartments
§ 22-1005 FOREWORD § 22-1006
FWD:595
development), lots may have frontage on a private street improved
as specified in § 22-1004, Subsection 1G, of this chapter, or for
which such improvements have been insured by the posting of
an acceptable performance guarantee, provided the developer
complies, inter alia, with § 27-801, Subsection 1A(2), of the
Township Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] and all other applicable
provisions of this chapter.
3. Through Lots.
A. Through lots shall ordinarily not be created except as needed to
avoid direct vehicular access onto an arterial street by individual
driveways.
B. (1) On any through or reverse frontage lots, each lot shall include
a fifteen-foot deep planting strip along one of the streets with
access across this strip clearly prohibited by notes on any

16, of this chapter, this planting strip shall meet the
requirements of § 27-803, Subsection 4, of the Township
Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27]. Any fencing in the rear of such
lots shall be placed on the inner perimeter of such plantings.
(3) This planting strip shall be placed along the street that the
Board of Commissioners determines will eventually serve the
most through-traffic. (For example, if a lot abuts a collector and
a local street, the planting strip shall be placed along the
collector street and the lot shall only have vehicular access
onto the local street).
4. If remnants of land (other than rights-of-way) exist after subdividing,
they shall be incorporated in existing or proposed lots. No lot shall be
created that would not be suitable for a use permitted in that zoning
district and meet all dimensional zoning requirements for that zoning
district.
5. Bus Stops.
A. The developer of residential land developments or subdivisions that
involve 15 or more dwelling units shall contact the school district to

required where such a system can feasibly be provided to the proposed
subdivision or land development tract and where such a system can
adequately fulfill the sewage disposal needs of the project.
3. Where connection to an existing centralized sanitary sewerage system
is not feasible, a centralized system with a treatment plant shall be
designed and constructed according to current Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection regulations and reviewed by
the Township Engineer. All treatment plants shall have a tertiary level
of treatment.
4. Where a centralized sanitary sewerage system is not yet accessible to
the site, but is planned for extension to the subdivision within a ten-year
period, the developer shall install sewer lines, including lateral
connections as may be necessary to provide adequate service to each
lot when connection with the sewerage system is made. The sewer lines
shall be suitably capped at the street right-of-way line. When capped
sewers are provided, on-lot disposal facilities shall also be provided.

each lot so served shall be of a size and shape to allow the safe
location of such a system.
B. Where individual on-site water supply system(s) are to be utilized,
it is required that the subdivider or land developer provide at least
one test well for each 10 proposed dwelling units. Such wells shall
be drilled, cased, and grout-sealed into bedrock at least 50 feet
deep and shall have a production capacity of at least five gallons
per minute (gpm) per proposed dwelling unit of safe, potable water
meeting all maximum contaminant level (MCL) parameters of the
PaDEP new source drinking water standards as certified by the
PaDEP or a PaDEP approved laboratory. The well(s) and
appurtenances shall be located, drilled and installed in accordance
with all applicable requirements of the PaDEP. The contaminant, its
test result, and its established MCL for a community water system
as described by the PaDEP, shall be included on the recorded plan
for any contaminant which exceeds the established MCL. The test
well(s) should be located such that they are remote from each
other, and such that they may be utilized as permanent wells by
future lot owners. The proposed location(s) shall be subject to

All electric power, telephone, cable television and natural gas distribution
lines shall be placed underground in accordance with the current standards
of the utility serving the subdivision or land development except where
the Board of Commissioners, or Planning Commission, as the case may be,
determine such placement is not feasible. When notifying public utilities
of the opportunity to serve any new subdivision or land development, the
review by the Township Engineer. During the drilling operation,
straw bales and filter fabric shall be provided, placed and properly
anchored as necessary for temporary control of silt-laden runoff
and soil erosion. The test well(s) shall be subjected to drawdown
tests (simultaneously if more than one test well) for a period of
at least eight hours to confirm that the capacity is adequate and
to determine the effects on existing wells adjacent to the land
development. The pumping rate shall be constant throughout the
duration of the test and shall be based on a minimum of five gpm
per proposed dwelling unit, with the resultant total rate distributed
approximately evenly over the total number of test wells. The test
well(s), along with existing wells adjacent to the land development,
shall be monitored for drawdown. The location(s) of the existing
well(s) which are to be monitored shall be subject to review by
the Township Engineer and shall depend on site-specific conditions
such as topography, soils, types, geology, test well pumping rate,
etc. The pumping rate and water level of each test well, and the
water level of each monitor well, shall be logged according to the
following schedule.

developer shall also notify all cable operators licensed to operate a cable
system in Salisbury Township of the opportunity to install cable facilities
to serve the subdivision or land development. Each separate tract of land
within a subdivision or land development shall have the opportunity to
connect to any cable operator permitted in Salisbury Township. No public
utility easements shall prevent any other cable operator authorized to
operate in Salisbury Township, now or in the future, from using such
easements to extend other and further lines to such subdivision or land
development. Also refer to the Cable Television Franchise Ordinance
[Chapter 13, Part 2] for further cable license agreement provisions.

unimpeded flow of natural water courses without damage to
persons or property.
B. Storm drainage facilities should be designed not only to handle the
anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided or
developed, but also to accommodate or receive the runoff that will
occur from properties at higher elevations (i.e., which drain
through the property being subdivided or developed).
C. Storm sewers shall tie into reasonably accessible existing storm
sewers if required by the Township and if adequate capacity exists
in the existing system.
D. All lots shall be laid out and graded to prevent cross lot drainage
and to provide positive drainage away from proposed building
areas and on-site sewage disposal facilities. A note to this effect
shall be placed on all plans to be recorded.
E. An adequate storm sewerage system consisting of inlets and other
underground drainage structures with approved outlets shall be

surface drainage facilities.
F. Outlets shall be approved by the Township Engineer and by the
Board of Commissioners:
(1) Natural drainage shall be maintained where reasonable.
(2) The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered nor shall the rate of runoff be
increased because of development without the written
approval of all affected landowners.
§ 22-1009 FOREWORD § 22-1010
FWD:601
(3) No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so
diverted as to overload drainage systems, or create flooding or
the need for additional drainage structures on other private
properties or public lands, without provisions deemed
acceptable to the Township being made by the developer to
satisfactorily handle such conditions.
G. Storm sewerage systems shall not be combined with sanitary
sewerage systems.
H. Design of storm drainage systems shall be based at a minimum
upon twenty-five-year return frequency storm flows and shall be
prepared and sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Complete sealed calculations shall
be submitted to the Township for review by the Township Engineer
(see Appendix D). All designs must be approved by the Township
Engineer.
2. Specific Requirements (refer to Appendix D for design criteria).
A. Collection Systems.
(1) Stormwater runoff from streets shall not be permitted to flow
across building lots but shall be collected with the street rightof-
way and discharged in a controlled manner.
(2) Inlets shall be placed at all low points, at points at points where
the flow in gutters exceeds three inches, and at a distance
appropriate to collect peak runoff expected from a twenty-fiveyear
minimum return frequency storm. Inlets or manholes shall
be placed, as appropriate, at points of change in the horizontal
or vertical directions of the storm sewers. In streets, inlets
shall normally be located along the curb line and at or beyond
the curb radius points. For the purpose of inlet location at
corners, the depth of flow shall be considered for each gutter.
At intersections, flow across through streets shall be avoided
but, if unavoidable, will not exceed one inch in depth.
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standard two-foot
by four-foot Type C, M, S inlets or approved equivalents should
be used. Inlets shall be depressed two inches below the grade
of the gutter or ground surface. Manholes may be substituted
for inlets at locations where inlets are not required to handle
surface runoff.
(3) Storm sewers shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches and
shall be coated, corrugated metal pipe with paved inverts or
reinforced concrete pipe. Concrete pipe shall be used within
the street right-of-way and in other areas required by the
Township Engineer. Minimum pipe slope shall be 1/2%.
(4) Drainage structures that are located in state highway rights-ofway
shall be approved by the PennDOT, and a letter from that
§ 22-1010 SALISBURY CODE § 22-1010
FWD:602
office indicating such approval shall be directed to the
Township before final plan approval or prior to the
commencement of any earth-moving, grading or construction.
(5) Vertical pipes, inlets, and other surface water receiving
structures shall be installed with child-proof protection and
trash racks where necessary.
(6) Bridges and culverts shall be designed to support expected
loads, to carry expected flows, and to be constructed to the full
width of the right-of-way in accordance with Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Construction Standards.
Hydraulic designs shall be based on criteria established by
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
(7) Minimum slopes of all turf swales shall be 0.01 foot per foot.
Concrete low flow channels must be provided within all open
channels with slopes less than 1%.
(8) Headwalls shall be used where storm runoff enters the storm
sewer horizontally from a natural or man-made channel. The
capacity of such storm sewers shall be calculated for both inlet
and outlet control. The lower value of the two shall be used to
determine the capacity of the storm sewer.
B. Detention Basins.
(1) Detention or retention basins shall be provided if the postdevelopment
peak rate of runoff exceeds the predevelopment
rate, unless determined unnecessary by the Township
Engineer. Basin designs shall be in accordance with any Act
167 Watershed Plan adopted in the area of development.
(2) Storage facilities shall, at a minimum, be designed to contain
the one-hundred-year frequency design storm. Maximum
allowable discharge from the basin for the two-, ten-, twentyfive-
and one-hundred-year storms shall be based upon the
applicable Act 167 release rate criteria. If no Act 167
Watershed Act is adopted for the area of development the
maximum allowable discharge shall not exceed the
predevelopment rate for the respective storm events.
(3) Method of design.
(a) A generally accepted basin design procedure such as SCS
Method, Penn State Runoff Model, or the Storage
Indication Method shall be used for basin design.
(b) The Modified Rational Method may be used for basin
design only if the tributary area is less than 750 acres in
size.

(4) Discharge from the basin shall reproduce the existing drainage
patterns from the site as closely as possible.
(5) Detention basins shall be designed to drain completely after
every storm. Basins in residential areas should to the extent
practical have slopes less than four horizontal to one vertical
and twenty-five-year stormwater depths less than 30 inches.
(6) Fencing shall be required around detention basins in the
following cases:
(a) The maximum depth of water in the basin for a twenty-fiveyear
design storm is greater than 30 inches.
(b) The side slopes of the basin are steeper than four
horizontal to one vertical.
(c) The time to empty basin is longer than three hours.
(d) The detention basin is to be dedicated to Salisbury
Township, and fencing is requested by the Township.
(e) The Board of Commissioners determines that the public
safety would be endangered if the basin is not fenced.
(7) If fencing is required around any detention pond, then a buffer
yard shall be installed which meets the requirements of
§ 27-803, Subsection 4D and E, of the Salisbury Township
Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].

K. After expiration of the 18 month maintenance period, the land
owner, tenant, or his agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally
responsible for maintaining all street tree or other required
landscaping in good condition, free from refuse, debris, weeds, and
undergrowth. All trees, shrubs, ground covers, and other plant
materials must be replaced within 120 days if they die or become
unhealthy because of accidents, drainage problems, disease, or
other causes.
1. Salisbury Township adopts the Comprehensive Plan of Salisbury
Township, Community Facilities Plan, Recreation and Open Space,
adopted May 28, 1992, by the Board of Commissioners as the
Recreation Plan for Salisbury Township.
A. Purpose. To provide adequate open spaces, recreation lands and
recreation facilities to serve new residents of new developments,
for both active and passive recreation, and to recognize and work
to carry out the Recreation Plan for Salisbury Township. This
section shall apply to any major subdivision, minor subdivision or
residential land development reviewed and approved by the
Township, but shall not apply to any resubdivision or lot
consolidation plan.
B. Limitations on Use of Fees.
(1) Any fees collected under this section shall be accounted for
separately from other Township funds.
(2) To ensure that the lands and facilities are accessible to the
residents and employees of the developments that paid fees
towards their cost, the Township designates two Recreation
Fee Districts. These districts are the Eastern Recreation Fee
District and the Western Recreation Fee District. Any fees
collected under this section shall only be expended within the
same recreation fee district as the subdivision or land
development that contributed the fees.
(3) Such fees shall only be used for the following: acquisition of
public open space, development and/or redevelopment of
existing or proposed public recreational facilities, landscaping
of public open space and closely related engineering and
design work.
§ 22-1016 FOREWORD § 22-1017
FWD:613
C. Land Dedication. Any subdivision or residential land development
regulated under this section shall be required to dedicate the
specified amount of common open space, unless the Board of
Commissioners determines that such land in that location would
not be desirable or efficient based upon the standards of this
section, in which case recreation fees-in-lieu of land shall be
required.
(1) Generally, it is the intent of this section that development of 10
or fewer dwelling units that do not include land that is adjacent
to existing publicly-owned land should be required to pay
recreation fees in lieu of dedicating land.
(2) The land and fee requirements of this section shall be based
upon the number of new dwelling units that would be
permitted on the lots of a subdivision or land development
after the plan is approved.
(3) Prime Open Space. For the purposes of this section, the term
Prime Open Space shall mean land proposed to be dedicated as
common open space that would meet all of the following
standards:
(a) Less than 6% slope.
(b) Not a wetland under federal and/or state regulations.
(c) Be part of a contiguous tract of at least two acres (which
may include pre-existing common open space that is
adjacent).
(d) Not be within the one-hundred-year floodplain, as defined
by official floodplain maps of the Township.
(4) Amount of Common Open Space. A subdivision or land
development shall be required to dedicate the following
amounts of common open space for each permitted new
dwelling unit, unless the Board of Commissioners determines
that recreation fees in lieu of the open space would be more in
the public interest:
Percentage of the Total
Required Common Open
Space that Would Meet the
Definition of Prime Open
Space
Minimum Required
Common Open Space Per
Permitted Dwelling Unit
0% to 25.0% 2,000 square feet
25.1% to 75.0% 1,500 square feet
75.1% to 100% 1,200 square feet
§ 22-1017 SALISBURY CODE § 22-1017
FWD:614
D. Fees for Residential Development. If the Board of Commissioners
determines that a land dedication within a proposed subdivision or
land development would not be in the public interest, the applicant
shall be required to pay fees in lieu of dedicating open space. A
notation stating that such fees are required shall be stated on the
final record plan. This fee shall be established per permitted
dwelling unit, and is included in the Township Fee Schedule, which
may be updated from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners.
E. Decision on Land vs. Fees. The Board of Commissioners shall
determine whether a land dedication or the payment of fees shall,
or a combination of the two shall be required. This determination
should, but is not required to, be made at the time of sketch plan
review. The Board of Commissioners should, at a minimum,
consider the following in reaching its decision:
(1) Whether the land in that location would serve a valid public
purpose and be suitable for active or passive recreation.
(2) Whether there is potential to make a desirable addition to an
existing public recreation area.
(3) Whether the proposed land would meet the objectives and
requirements of this section and any relevant policies of the
Township Comprehensive Plan.
(4) Whether the area surrounding the proposed development has
sufficient existing recreation and open space land, and
whether it is possible for pedestrians and bicyclists to reach
those lands.
(5) Any recommendations that may be received from the Planning
Commission, Township Engineer, the Recreation Advisory
Committee and other Township staff.
(6) Whether the proposed open spaces would preserve important
natural features (such as woodlands or creek valleys) that
might otherwise be negatively affected.
(7) Whether it could be possible to combine common open space
on this tract with the additional open spaces on an adjacent
tract, when the tract is developed in the future.
F. Common Open Space to be Dedicated.
(1) Land required to be dedicated shall be suitable for its intended
purpose. The applicant shall state what improvements, if any,
he/she intends to make to the land to make it suitable for its
intended purpose, such as rough grading, landscaping or
development of trails. Such land shall be free of construction
and other debris at the time of dedication.
§ 22-1017 FOREWORD § 22-1017
FWD:615
(2) Required common open space shall be dedicated to the
Township, unless the Board of Commissioners agree to allow a
dedication to any of the following: the Salisbury Township
School District, the County, a homeowner association or an
environmental organization acceptable to the Board of
Commissioners. In the case of a rental development, the
Township may permit the common open space to be retained
by the owner of the rental development.
(3) If required common open space is to be owned by a homeowner
association, the developer shall establish such association in a
form that requires all property owners within the development
to annually contribute to the maintenance of the common open
space. Provisions of any homeowner association agreements
regarding required common open space shall be subject to
acceptance by the Board of Commissioners, based upon review
by the Township Solicitor. The provisions of § 705(f) of the MPC
should serve as a model for such agreement.
(4) Any required common open space dedication shall include
deed restrictions to permanently prevent the development of
buildings, except buildings for noncommercial recreation or to
support maintenance of the land for recreation.
(5) Priority shall be given to dedication of land in approximate

subdivided, the applicant shall provide a sketch of a possible
future land dedication on these adjacent lands in case they
would be developed in the future.
(9) Coordination With Future Adjacent Dedication. The Board of
Commissioners may require that a required land dedication
within a property currently being subdivided be placed along
an edge of the property so that it may, in the future, be
combined with an open space dedication on the edge of an
adjoining property when that adjoining property is subdivided
or developed.
G. Combination of Land and Fees. Upon approval of the Board of
Commissioners, the Township may accept a combination of
common open space and fees in lieu of land to meet the
requirements of this section for a residential subdivision or land

to the recording of the final plan, except as follows:
(1) If the Township agrees to provisions in a binding development
improvement agreement to require the payment of all
applicable recreation fees prior to the issuance of any building
permits within each clearly defined phase of the development,
then the fees are not required to be paid prior to recording of
the final plan but may instead be paid within the requirements
of that development agreement.
(2) If the applicant agrees to pay such fees in installments, then all
such fees shall not be considered to be paid, for the purposes of
any applicable time limitations for utilization under the MPC,
until all such fees are paid in full, including all installments and
phases.
I. Facilities in Place of Land or Fees. An applicant may seek a
modification from the recreation fee or open space requirements of
this section under the procedures of § 22-1202 of this chapter by
substituting for such fee the construction of permanent recreation
facilities within the proposed subdivision or land development, on

of development (e.g., number and type of dwelling units,
square footages, etc.).
(5) Identification of current and proposed land uses within the
identified study area.
(6) Any staging of development and completion date.
B. Traffic Facilities Description. Existing traffic conditions shall be
measured and documented for all streets and intersections in the
identified study area. [See § 22-1018, Subsection 3A(3).] Existing
traffic volumes for average daily traffic, peak highway hour(s)
traffic and peak development-generated hour(s) traffic shall be
recorded. Traffic counts at designated intersections in the study
area shall be conducted, encompassing the peak highway and peak
development generated hour(s), and documentation shall be
included in the report. A volume/capacity analysis based upon
existing volumes shall be performed during the peak highway
hour(s) for all designated streets and intersections in the study
area. Levels of service shall be determined for each roadway
segment to be studied and including all turning movements.
Detailed traffic counts of existing local streets are not required,
unless recommended by the Township Engineer or Alternate
Township Engineer. A tabulation of specific accident data including
locations and types of accidents for the most recent four-year
period shall be included in the analysis. This analysis will
determine the adequacy of the existing roadway system to serve
the current traffic demand. Roadways and/or turning movements
experiencing levels of Service D, E, or F, as described in TRB
Special Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual, Third Edition
(1994), shall be noted as congestion locations.

evaluation shall compare the projected traffic to PennDOT warrant
regulations for traffic signal installation.
D. Traffic Impact of the Development. Estimation of vehicular trips
resulting from the proposed project shall be completed for the peak
highway and peak development-generated hour(s). Vehicular trip
generation rates to be used for this calculation shall be obtained
from the most recent Trip Generation Manual, published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers. These development
generated traffic volumes shall be provided for the inbound and
outbound traffic movements as estimated, and the reference
source(s) and methodology followed shall be documented. All
turning movements shall be calculated. These generated volumes
shall be distributed to the area and assigned to the existing streets
and intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of all
assumptions used in the distribution shall be provided. Traffic
volumes shall be assigned to individual access points. Any
characteristics of the site that will cause particular trip generation
problems shall be noted. The impact of any diversion or rerouting
of existing traffic by the proposal shall be analyzed. For retail sales
uses, the increased traffic during the Christmas season and during
weekends shall be forecast and analyzed.
E. An analysis of future traffic conditions with proposed development.
The total future traffic demand shall be calculated and analyzed.
This demand shall consist of a combination of the existing traffic
expanded to the proposed project build-out year, the proposed
development-generated traffic, and the traffic generated by other
proposed development within the study area. This analysis shall be
performed for the peak hour(s) for all designated roadways and
intersections within the study area. All access points shall be
examined as to the necessity of installing traffic signals. This
evaluation shall compare the projected traffic to PennDOT warrant
regulations for traffic signal installation.
F. Recommendations and Conclusions. Levels of service for all
designated streets and intersections within the study area shall be
listed. All streets and/or intersections showing a level of service
below "C" shall be considered deficient and specific
recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall be
identified. This listing of recommended improvements shall
include, but not be limited to, the following elements: internal
circulation design, site access location and design, external
roadway and intersection design and improvements, and traffic
signal installation and operation including signal timing. All
physical street improvements and existing traffic control devices
shall be shown on plan drawings.

of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax exists,
except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be one-half of the rate and
such one-half rate shall become effective without any action on the part
of Salisbury Township provided, however, that Salisbury Township and

and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on

employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payrollperiod
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection 4 of this section. For

annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.

fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.

11-2007-538, 11/29/2007]

length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
5. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
6. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withhold by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection 2
of § 24-403 of this Part and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this Part.

shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

connection is made to the water system, a flat rate shall be charged
until such time as a meter is installed. In such case, the following
temporary flat rates shall apply during this period:
Type Rate
For the first faucet or opening $6.25 per quarter
For each additional faucet or
opening
$2.00 per quarter
E. Fire Hydrant Standby Charge. Any owner of real property in
Salisbury Township who has a privately owned fire hydrant situate
on his or her property within the Township shall pay a fire hydrant
standby charge to the Township of $400 per year for each privately
owned fire hydrant which receives water from the Salisbury
Township public water service system. The Township shall perform
all testing of, and shall maintain and replace, each privately owned
fire hydrant, as deemed necessary and appropriate by the Township
for the public health, safety and welfare.

amount of the bill and collected as part thereof. When bills are paid
by mail, the date of the postmark will be considered the date of the
payment.
3. Whenever any bill for water service furnished to a consumer shall
remain unpaid for a period in excess of 30 days after the date thereof,
the Township shall mail a delinquency notice to the consumer, which
notice shall inform the customer of the delinquency and the penalty and
shall declare the intention of the Township to shut off and discontinue
water service. Water service will not be restored until the bill, including
penalties, together with a turn-off and turn-on charge of $10 each, has
been paid.
4. Whenever water service to any consumer unit shall begin after the first
day or shall terminate before the last day of any billing period, the

equitably for that portion of the billing period during which service was
provided by the Township.
5. Each bill for water service shall be made out in the name of the
consumer. Each consumer shall provide the Township with, and
thereafter shall keep the Township advised of, his correct address.

the period of time during which such bill shall be payable without
penalty.

and until: the consumer shall have notified the Township of such
vacancy in writing; and such vacancy shall continue for at least 30 days.

application to the Township for water service shall be made by such
owner.

shall be legally responsible for all bills rendered to consumers
occupying property of the owner.
B. Such application for service shall be made on a form to be provided
by the Township and shall be accompanied by such maps, reports
or other data as may be required by the Township.

28/2010]
2. Making application to the Township for water service shall constitute
an agreement by the applicant or applicants to comply with all rules
and regulations of the Authority or the Township relating to the water
system and shall constitute a grant to the Township of authorization for
its properly authorized and identified representatives to have full and
free access to the property to be served at all reasonable times for the
purpose of reading meters, for inspection and repairs, for removal of
property of the Township or for any other purpose incident to rendering
water service. It shall be mandatory that every inside water meter be
read by the Township meter reader at least once in every twelve-month
period and upon the transfer of ownership of any property within the
Township.
1. Use of Water. Water supplied by the Township may be used for all
residential, business, industrial, agricultural, public or other legal
purposes; provided, however, that the Township reserves the right to
impose at any time such restrictions in the use of water as may become
necessary due to accidents, breakdowns, shortages of water, temporary
discontinuance of water service to make necessary repairs, removals or
replacements or other unavoidable emergencies. Every effort will be
made to notify consumers before service is interrupted. However, no
deduction in water rates will be allowed for failure on the part of the
Township to supply water, and the Township shall not be responsible for
any losses due to inability to supply water.
2. Meter Service. Except for those consumers being charged for water
service on a flat-rate basis, as provided in § 26-102, and, except upon
special written permission granted by the Township, each consumer
unit shall be required to have installed a water meter to measure the
quantity of water consumed. Each such meter shall be furnished by the
Township or the Authority and installed by the Township or the
Authority, or by the owner in accordance with rules and regulations
adopted by the Township or the Authority. All meters shall remain the
property of the Township or the Authority.
3. Multiple Consumer Units. In any case where the Township grants
written permission for more than one consumer unit to be served
through a common water meter a multiple consumption charge per
quarter shall be imposed for such service, which charge shall be
calculated in the following manner: (i) the total consumption through
such service connection and meter shall be divided by the number of
consumer units served thereby; (ii) the schedule of water rates, rents
and charges established under § 26-102, Subsection 1A, shall be
applied to the resultant quotient; and (iii) the resultant pro-rata charge
for each consumer unit shall be multiplied by the number of consumer
units served through such service connection and water meter to arrive

previous owner shall notify the Township, in writing and in advance, of the
date of discontinuance of the service under his ownership. Should the owner
fail to give such notice, he shall be responsible for all charges up to and
including the date the new owner makes application for service. The new
owner shall make application for service in the same manner as for a new
service.

connection and one meter, each such consumer unit shall be
charged a minimum charge of $11.50 per quarter.
B. Where four or more consumer units are served through one
connection and one meter, each such consumer unit shall be
charged a minimum charge of $10.50 per quarter.
1. Deposits may be required from consumers taking service for a period of
less than 30 days in an amount equal to the estimated gross bill for such
temporary period. Deposits may be required from all other consumers,
provided that in no instance may deposits be required in excess of the
estimated gross bill for any single billing period plus one month (the
maximum period not to exceed four months), with a minimum of $5.
2. Deposits secured from a consumer shall be returned to the depositor
when he shall have paid undisputed bills for service over a period of 12
consecutive months; and any such consumer, having secured the return
of a deposit, shall not be required to make a new deposit unless the
service has been discontinued or the consumer's credit standing
impaired through failure to comply with provisions hereof.
3. The payment of any undisputed bill shall be payment of the bill with or
without penalty within 30 days following the period for which the bill
was rendered or payment within 30 days following the presentation of
the bill, or the payment of any contested bill, payment of which is
withheld beyond the period herein mentioned, where the dispute is
terminated substantially in favor of the consumer and payment made by
the consumer within 10 days thereafter.

time and, if such meter is found to be inaccurate, to substitute another

2. In case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter, such
meter will be tested by the Township upon the written request of the
consumer. In the event the meter tested is found to have an error in the
registration greater than 2%, plus or minus, the cost of the test will be
borne by the Township, and the bills will be adjusted accordingly.
Should the meter be found to be correct, the cost for testing shall be
billed to the consumer on the next quarterly bill submitted.

connection. Should it be found that an unnecessary amount of water is
being used, the Township reserves the right to eliminate the connection
at once, or it may place a meter thereon, in which case the expense of
the change shall be paid by the consumer. Thereafter, the water rates,
rents and charges set forth in § 26-102, Subsection 1A, shall be
applicable to such service.

flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic patterns, destroys
aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and
loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and
control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental
to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the
people of the municipality and all of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer system under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).28

§ 26-206, Subsection 3, provided that the approved drainage plan
included design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site
currently proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance
provisions in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not
lapsed under the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant revisions
are made to the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval
and the effective date of this Part, preparation of a new drainage plan,
subject to the provisions of this Part, shall be required. Significant
revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques,
relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original
drainage plan.

Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a "designated use," such
as "cold water fishes" or "potable water supply," which is listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under
state regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway, to prevent these impacts.

of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of more than 10 acres,
not involving any new street or easement of access or any residential
dwelling, shall be exempted.
SURFACE WATERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH  Any and all rivers,
streams, creeks, rivulets, impoundments, ditches, watercourses, storm
sewers, lakes, dammed water, wetlands, ponds, springs and all other
bodies or channels of conveyance of surface water, or parts thereof,
whether natural or artificial, within or on the boundaries of this
commonwealth.
SWALE  A low-lying stretch of land which gathers or carries surface
water runoff. See also "vegetated swale."
TECHNICAL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE MANUAL &
INFILTRATION FEASIBILITY REPORT, NOVEMBER 2002  The report
written by Cahill Associates that addresses the feasibility of infiltration
in carbonate bedrock areas in the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed. The
report is available at the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission offices.
TRASH/DEBRIS COLLECTORS  Racks, screens or other similar
devices installed in a storm drainage system to capture coarse
pollutants (trash, leaves, etc.).
VEGETATED BUFFERS  Gently sloping areas that convey stormwater
as sheet flow over a broad, densely vegetated earthen area, possibly
coupled with the use of level spreading devices. Vegetated buffers
should be situated on minimally disturbed soils, have low-flow velocities
and extended residence times.
VEGETATED ROOFS  Vegetated systems installed on roofs that
generally consist of a waterproof layer, a root-barrier, drainage layer
(optional), growth media, and suitable vegetation. "Vegetated roofs"

store and eventually evapotranspirate the collected rooftop rainfall;
overflows may be provided for larger storms.
VEGETATED SWALES 
WATER QUALITY INSERTS  Any number of commercially available
devices that are inserted into storm inlets to capture sediment, oil,
grease, metals, trash, debris, etc.
WATER QUALITY VOLUME (WQV)  The volume needed to capture
and treat 90% of the average annual rainfall volume. (See § 26-224,
Subsection 2.)
WATERCOURSE  Any channel or conveyance of surface water having
defined bed and banks, whether natural or artificial, with perennial or
intermittent flow.
WATERSHED  The entire region or area drained by a river or other
body of water, whether natural or artificial.
WET DETENTION PONDS  Basins that provide for necessary
stormwater storage as well as a permanent pool of water. To be
successful, wet ponds must have adequate natural hydrology (both
runoff inputs as well as soils and water table which allow for
maintenance of a permanent pool of water) and must be able to support
a healthy aquatic community so as to avoid creation of mosquito and
other health and nuisance problems.
Vegetated earthen channels designed to convey stormwater. These
swales are not considered to be water quality BMPs.
A.
Broad, shallow, densely vegetated, earthen channels designed to
treat stormwater while slowly infiltrating, evapotranspirating, and
conveying it. Swales should be gently sloping with low flow
velocities to prevent erosion. Check dams may be added to enhance
performance.

Stormwater Management Requirements.
§ 26-221. General Requirements. [Ord. 03-2007-533, 3/22/2007,
§ 301]
1. All regulated activities in the municipality shall be subject to the
stormwater management requirements of this Part.
2. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unobstructed flow
in natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities, recharge facilities, water quality facilities, pipe systems or
open channels consistent with this Part.
3. The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written approval of the
affected property owner(s).
4. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this Part. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and
discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document that
there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely
transport the concentrated discharge to the point of predevelopment
flow concentration, to the stream reach or otherwise prove that no
harm will result from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing
diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release
rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they
are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage
areas.
5. Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a
one-hundred-year floodplain is defined by the municipality, there shall
be provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the line
of such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unobstructed flow of storm runoff based on calculations
made in conformance with § 26-227 for the one-hundred-year return
period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot above the
design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper
runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the onehundred-
year floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable
municipal floodplain regulations.
6. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line

§ 26-222. Permit Requirements by Other Government Entities. [Ord.
03-2007-533, 3/22/2007, § 302]
and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning equation.
7. Post construction BMPs shall be designed, installed, operated and
maintained to meet the requirements of the Clean Streams Law and
implementing regulations, including the established practices in 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102 and the specifications of this Part as to prevent
accelerated erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of
discharge.
8. No earth disturbance activities associated with any regulated activities
shall commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this Part.
9. Techniques described in Appendix F, Low Impact Development,35 of this
Part are encouraged because they reduce the costs of complying with
the requirements of this Part and the state water quality requirements.
10. Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and
geology permit, consistent with the provisions of this Part and, where
appropriate, the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater
Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D.36
1. The following permit requirements apply to certain regulated and earth
disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of
regulated and earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
A. All regulated and earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
B. Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by DEP under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102 and Chapter 105.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including
wetlands, subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a
state highway right-of-way or require access from a state highway
shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PENNDOT).
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which

§ 26-223. Erosion and Sediment Control During Regulated Earth
Disturbance Activities. [Ord. 03-2007-533, 3/22/2007, § 303]

may constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan for construction activities. Written approval by
DEP or a delegated County Conservation District shall satisfy this
requirement.
2. An Erosion and Sediment Control Plan is required by DEP regulations
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
3. A DEP NPDES Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities Permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality before the
commencement of an Earth Disturbance Activity.
5. A copy of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this Part. This Part provides standards to
meet NPDES permit requirements associated with construction
activities and MS4 permit requirements.
2. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways. First, WQv shall be calculated using
the following formula:
WQv = (C)(P)(A)\12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
C = Rational Method post-development runoff
coefficient for the two-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
§ 26-222 FOREWORD § 26-224
FWD:717
Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff volume
from predevelopment to post-development for the two-year return
period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site shall be
considered in this calculation. The larger of these two calculated
volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and treated, except
that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to exceed 1.25 inches of
runoff over the site area. This standard does not limit the volume of
infiltration an applicant may propose for purposes of water quantity/
peak rate control.
3. The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
4. If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet
pond, constructed wetland or other BMP that ponds water on the land
surface and may receive direct sunlight, the discharge from that BMP
must be treated by infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip,
bioretention, vegetated swale or other BMP that provides a thermal
benefit to protect the high quality waters of the Saucon Creek
Watershed from thermal impacts.
5. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
§ 26-224, Subsection 15, except for minor areas on the periphery of the
site that cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other
BMP.
6. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration
BMP standards of this Part.
7. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
and non-carbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.
8. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMP's, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G.37 This
investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal
high water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified
Sewage Enforcement Officer (SEO) except that the location(s) of
special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical
professional.
37.Editor's Note: Appendix G is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-224 SALISBURY CODE § 26-224
FWD:718
9. Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
A. Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
B. Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet, except for infiltration of
residential roof runoff where the seasonal high water table must be
below the invert of the BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between
two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth
to seasonal high water table is required.)
C. Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15,
percolation test in Appendix G38) greater than or equal to 0.5 inch/
hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
D. Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations, except for residential development where the
required set-back is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet
upgradient from building foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields, except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic
system drainfields.
(4) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(5) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential
future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring
properties will be met, except for one- and two-family
residential dwellings where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks
from existing or potential future wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
10. For entirely non-carbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in § 26-224,
Subsection 21.
38.Editor's Note: Appendix G is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-224 FOREWORD § 26-224
FWD:719
A. The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25) * (I)/12
Where:
Rev = Recharge volume in acre-feet
I = Impervious area in acres
B. The preliminary site investigation described in § 26-224,
Subsection 8, is required and shall continue on different areas of
the site until a potentially suitable infiltration location is found or
the entire site is determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For
infiltration areas that appear to be feasible based on the
preliminary site investigation, the additional site investigation and
testing as outlined in Appendix G shall be completed.
C. If an applicant proposes infiltration, the municipality may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing
conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of
infiltration.
D. The site must meet the conditions listed in § 26-224, Subsection 9.
E. If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be
considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as
described in § 26-224, Subsection 15.
F. If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to
be captured and treated.
11. In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to use
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
§ 26-224, Subsection 8, shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that
appear feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the
applicant shall conduct the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed
loading rate, each weighted as described in § 26-227, along with the
buffer from special geologic features shall be compared to the
Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs
in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D to determine if the site is
recommended for infiltration. In addition to the recommendation from
Appendix D, the conditions listed in § 26-224, Subsection 9, are
required for infiltration in carbonate areas.39 Applicants are
encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as calculated in § 26-224, Subsection
10, but are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a carbonate site
even if the site falls in the "Recommended" range on the chart in
Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be subtracted from
39.Editor's Note: Appendices D and G are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 26-224 SALISBURY CODE § 26-224
FWD:720
the WQv to be treated by non-infiltration BMPs. If infiltration is not
proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs, as
specified in § 26-224, Subsection 15.
12. If a site has both carbonate and non-carbonate areas, the applicant
shall investigate the ability of the non-carbonate portion of the site to
fully meet this Part to meet the requirements for REv for the whole site
through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the
carbonate area as described in § 26-224, Subsection 11, or two other
noninfiltration BMPs as described in § 26-224, Subsection 15, must be
used. No infiltration structure in the non-carbonate area shall be
located within 50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except
when a preliminary site investigation has been done showing the
absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed
infiltration area.
13. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment
two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or
more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion of
the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
14. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
15. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet the requirement of this section. Acceptable BMPs
are listed below along with the recommended reference for design.

20. The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the
regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical
degradation of receiving waters from such effects as scour and
streambank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements,
by controlling the two-year post-development runoff to a 30% release
rate.

methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law including but not
limited to the Clean Streams Law.
1. Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts: To implement the
provisions of the Saucon Creek Watershed Stormwater Management
Plan, the municipality is hereby divided into Stormwater Management
Districts consistent with the Saucon Creek Release Rate Map presented

Dual Release Rate Districts as described below.
A. Conditional/Provisional No Detention Districts. Within these
districts, the capacity of the "local" runoff conveyance facilities (as
defined in § 26-211) must be calculated to determine if adequate
capacity exists. For this determination, the developer must
calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the
existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this Part. The larger of the two peak flows calculated
will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists. If adequate
capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main
channel (as defined in § 26-211), these watershed areas may
discharge post-development peak runoff without detention
facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the "local" runoff
conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall
either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased
capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows
consistent with § 26-226, Subsection 16. Any capacity

§ 26-226. Stormwater Management District Implementation
Provisions. [Ord. 03-2007-533, 3/22/2007, § 306]
improvements must be designed to convey runoff from
development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent
with the capacity criteria specified in § 26-224, Subsection 4. By
definition, a storm drainage problem area associated with the
"local" runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity
does not exist. Sites in these districts are still required to meet all
of the water quality requirements in § 26-224.
B. Dual Release Rate Districts. Within these districts, the two-year
post-development peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the
predevelopment two-year runoff peak. Further, the ten-, twentyfive-
and one-hundred-year post-development peak runoff must be
controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak.
Release rates associated with the ten- through one-hundred-year
events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the
watershed.
1. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post-construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of
discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this Part.
2. Any stormwater management controls required by this Part and subject
to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate
criteria for each of the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology
specified in § 26-227.
3. The exact location of the Stormwater Management District boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The district boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the down-stream limit of the subarea and the subarea
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
4. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
Part shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
§ 26-225 FOREWORD § 26-226
FWD:727
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
5. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from
the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
6. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas re-combine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate, provided that
the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
7. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a Conditional/Provisional No
Detention Subarea, the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a
site may not be changed post-development to create potentially adverse
conditions on downstream properties except as part of a "no harm" or
hardship waiver procedure.
8. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Saucon Creek
Watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a "no harm" or
hardship waiver procedure.
9. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s) or (b) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where (b) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
§ 26-226, Subsection 4, and the minimum orifice criteria.
10. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
§ 26-226 SALISBURY CODE § 26-226
FWD:728
criteria in § 26-226, Subsection 4, and the detention criteria in
§ 26-227.
11. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
12. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
13. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this Part.
14. "No Harm" Water Quantity Option.
A. For any proposed development site not located in a Conditional/
Provisional No Detention District, the developer has the option of
using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the
developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the
proposed development site and that "no harm" would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the Plan.
Special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic
aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the
development of the Plan runoff control strategy. Proof of "no harm"
would have to be shown from the development site through the
remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence
of the creek with the Delaware or Lehigh River. Proof of "no harm"
must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in § 26-226,
Subsection 4, if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the "no
harm" justification.
B. Attempts to prove "no harm" based upon downstream peak flow
versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following
provisions:
(1) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated PSRM
Model for the Saucon Creek Watershed or as calculated by an
applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the
municipality. The flow values from the PSRM Model would be
supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request.
§ 26-226 FOREWORD § 26-226
FWD:729
(2) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system
as documented by a developer may be used by the developer
only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to
the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified
capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped
acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
(3) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove "no harm," except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with § 26-226,
Subsection 4.
C. Any "no harm" justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Subpart D. Developers
submitting "no harm" justifications must still meet all of the water
quality requirements in § 26-224.
15. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
16. Capacity Improvements.
A. In certain instances, primarily within the Conditional/Provisional
No Detention areas, local drainage conditions may dictate more
stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection
of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could
prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to
relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then
the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in
lieu of runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow
calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in
the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed
is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff
controls. Any capacity improvements would be designed using the
larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in
§ 26-226, Subsection 4. All new development in the entire
subarea(s) within which the proposed development site is located
shall be assumed to implement the developer's proposed discharge
control, if any.

FWD:730
§ 26-227. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 03-2007-533, 3/22/2007,
§ 307]
B. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified "no harm" option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
2. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D shall be calculated as follows:
(Area tributary to infiltration BMP\Base area of
infiltration BMP
*100%
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
All disturbed areas to be made
impervious:
Weight at 100%
All disturbed areas to be made pervious: Weight at 50%
All undisturbed pervious areas: Weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: Weight at 100%
3. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability (as measured by the
adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15, percolation test in Appendix G), as
follows:41
Permeability Range* Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
41.Editor's Note: Appendices D and G are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 26-226 FOREWORD § 26-227
FWD:731
* If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code
§ 73.15, percolation test in Appendix G) falls on a break between
two thickness factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12 inches/hour or less
than 0.5 inch/hour as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code
§ 73.15, percolation test in Appendix G, are not recommended for
infiltration.
4. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this Part shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the storage indication method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be either the Universal Rational Hydrograph or the
Modified Rational Method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes
detention volume. Use of the Modified Rational hydrograph shall be
consistent with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the
Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrology Model (1987).
5. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
6. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
7. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows.
8. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum one-foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the twothrough
twenty-five-year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall be
provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two- through onehundred-
year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow
rate with a minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the top of basin.
The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site areas
tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention
facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design of
the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105 regulations, and
may be required to pass a storm greater than the one hundred-year
event.
9. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser
size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
§ 26-227 SALISBURY CODE § 26-227
FWD:732
acceptable with a three-inch orifice, provided that as much of the site
runoff as practical is directed to the detention facilities. The minimum
three-inch diameter does not apply to the control of the WQv.
10. Runoff calculations using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall depths for the
various return periods to be used consistent with this Part may be taken
from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 Version 2.1, 2004 or the PennDOT
Intensity - Duration - Frequency Field Manual ("PDT-IDF") (May 1986)
for Region 4. The following values are taken from the PDT-IDF Field
Manual:
Return Period 24-Hour Rainfall Depth
1-year 2.40 inches
2-year 3.00 inches
5-year 3.60 inches
10-year 4.56 inches
25-year 5.52 inches
50-year 6.48 inches
100-year 7.44 inches
A graphical and tabular presentation of the Type II-24 hour
distribution is included in Appendix C.42
11. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 Version 2.1, 2004 or the
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix C.
12. Runoff Curve Numbers (CNs) to be used in the soil-cover-complex
method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix C.
13. Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in Appendix C.
14. All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
A. Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the Soil-Cover-Complex method.
42.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-227 FOREWORD § 26-227
FWD:733
B. Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from
the watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure
3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
C. Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the
table presented in Appendix C.
D. Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning equation assuming full flow and the
Manning 'n' values from Appendix C.
15. If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
If using the Rational Method, all post-development calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
16. The Manning equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix C or other appropriate
standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities shall be
determined by methods acceptable to the municipality.
17. The Pennsylvania DEP, Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, apply to
the construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both
existing and proposed dams, water obstructions and encroachments
throughout the watershed. Criteria for design and construction of
stormwater management facilities according to this Part may differ
from the criteria that are used in the permitting of dams under the Dam
Safety Program.

applicant. The waiver request shall be in writing and accompanied by
the requisite fee based upon a fee schedule adopted by the municipality.
A copy of the waiver request shall be provided to each of the following:
municipality, Municipal Engineer, Municipal Solicitor and Lehigh Valley
Planning Commission. The request shall fully document the nature of
the alleged hardship.
2. The municipality may grant a waiver provided that all of the following
findings are made in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this Part in the Stormwater
Management District in which the property is located;
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Part, including the "no harm"
§ 26-235 FOREWORD § 26-237
FWD:739
provisions, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
D. That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue; and
E. That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship
waiver.
3. In granting any waiver, the municipality may attach such conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Part. If a hardship waiver is granted, the applicant must still manage
the quantity, velocity, direction and quality of resulting storm runoff as
is necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or other property.
A. For regulated activities described in § 26-205, Subsections 1 and 2,
Salisbury Township shall hear requests for and decide on hardship
waiver requests on behalf of the municipality.

MANAGEMENT PLAN
A.
General Provisions.
§ 26-401. Short Title. [Ord. 07-2005-523, 7/28/2005, § 101]
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Little Lehigh Creek
Watershed Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 26-402. Statement of Findings. [Ord. 07-2005-523, 7/28/2005,
§ 102]
1. The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic patterns, destroys
aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and
loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and
control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental
to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the
people of the municipality and all of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.44
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.45
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from

Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).46
F. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer
systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth
by the municipality.47
1. The purpose of this Part is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare within the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed by minimizing the
damages and maximizing the benefits described in § 26-402 of this Part
by provisions designed to:
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities which cause such problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage
systems.
C. Encourage infiltration of stormwater, where appropriate, to
maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
D. Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and
watercourses in the municipality and the commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the flood carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide for proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management BMPs that are implemented in the municipality.
G. Provide review procedures and performance standards for
stormwater planning, design and management.48
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.49
I. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support

defined in §§ 26-405, Subsections 2E and F, which would create 10,000
square feet or less of additional impervious cover is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part. The date of the
municipal ordinance adoption of the original Little Lehigh Act 167
Stormwater Management Ordinance (1988) shall be the starting point
from which to consider tracts as parent tracts in which future
subdivisions and respective impervious area computations shall be
cumulatively considered. For development taking place in stages, the
entire development plan must be used in determining conformance
with these criteria. Additional impervious cover shall include, but not
be limited to, additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages,
driveways, storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or
driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part
of or for the proposed regulated activity. Any additional areas proposed
to initially be gravel, crushed stone, porous pavement, etc., shall be
assumed to be impervious for the purposes of comparison to the
exemption criteria. Any existing gravel, crushed stone or hard packed

purpose of exemption evaluation. All of the impervious cover added
incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall be
subject to the provisions of this Part. If a site has previously received an
exemption and is proposing additional development such that the total
impervious cover on the site exceeds 10,000 square feet, the total
impervious cover on the site proposed since the original ordinance date
must meet the provisions of this Part.
2. Prior Drainage Plan Approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this Part is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part, except as cited in
§ 26-406, Subsection 3, provided that the approved drainage plan
included design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site
currently proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance
provisions in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not
lapsed under the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant revisions
are made to the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval
and the effective date of this Part, preparation of a new drainage plan,
subject to the provisions of this Part, shall be required. Significant
revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques,
relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original
drainage plan.

Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under
state regulations.
A.
Existing uses are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway, to prevent these impacts.

1. All regulated activities in the municipality shall be subject to the
stormwater management requirements of this Part.
2. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unimpeded flow in
natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities, pipe systems or open channels consistent with this Part.
3. The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written approval of the
affected property owner(s).
4. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this Part. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and
discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document that
there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely
transport the concentrated discharge to the point of predevelopment
flow concentration, to the stream reach or otherwise prove that no
harm will result from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing
diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release
rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they
are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage
areas.
5. Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a
one-hundred-year floodplain is defined by the municipality, there shall
be provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the line
of such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unimpeded flow of storm runoff based on calculations made
in conformance with § 26-427 for the one-hundred-year return period
runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 1/2 foot above the design
water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper
runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the onehundred-
year floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable
Municipal floodplain regulations.
6. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line
and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning equation.

the requirements of this Part and the state water quality
requirements.71
10. Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and
geology permit, consistent with the provisions of this Part and, where
appropriate, the recommendation chart for Infiltration Stormwater
Management BMPs in carbonate bedrock in Appendix H. Infiltration is
encouraged for capturing and treating the water quality volume (as
calculated in § 26-424), any part of the water quality volume or for
otherwise meeting the purposes of this Part.
1. The following permit requirements apply to certain regulated and earth
disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of
regulated and earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
A. All regulated and earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
B. Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by DEP under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including
wetlands, subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a
state highway right-of-way or require access from a state highway
shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PENNDOT).
70.NOTE: Throughout this Part, these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4
Ordinance Provisions and are not required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations.
71.NOTE: Throughout this Part, these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4
Ordinance Provisions and are not required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations.

§ 26-423. Erosion and Sediment Control During Regulated Earth
Disturbance Activities.72 [Ord. 07-2005-523, 7/28/2005, § 303]
§ 26-424. Post-Construction Water Quality Criteria. [Ord.
07-2005-523, 7/28/2005, § 304]
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which
may constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan for construction activities. Written approval by
DEP or a delegated County Conservation District shall satisfy this
requirement.
2. An Erosion and Sediment Control Plan is required by DEP regulations
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
3. A DEP NPDES Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities Permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality before the
commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
5. A copy of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
1. 73No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with this Part. DEP has determined that this
Part meets state water quality requirements. Therefore, any approvals
under this Part would satisfy the post-construction stormwater
management requirements associated with an NPDES permit for
stormwater discharges associated with construction activities.
2. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways. First, WQv shall be calculated using
the following formula:
72.NOTE: Throughout this Part, these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4
Ordinance Provisions and are not required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations.
73.NOTE: Throughout this Part, these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4
Ordinance Provisions and are not required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations.
§ 26-422 FOREWORD § 26-424
FWD:775
WQv = (c)(P)(A)\12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
c = Rational Method post-development runoff coefficient
for the two-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff volume
from predevelopment to post-development for the two-year-returnperiod
storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site shall be
considered in this calculation. The larger of these two calculated
volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and treated, except
that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to exceed 1.25 inches of
runoff over the site area.
3. The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
4. If an applicant is proposing to use a wet pond, constructed wetland or
other BMP that ponds water on the land surface and may receive direct
sunlight, the discharge from that BMP must be treated by infiltration, a
vegetated buffer, filter strip, bioretention, vegetated swale or other
BMP that provides a thermal benefit to protect the high quality waters
of the Little Lehigh Creek from thermal impacts.
5. Any stormwater runoff from the site as a result of the regulated
activities must either be treated with infiltration or two acceptable
BMPs such as those listed in § 26-424, Subsection 14.
6. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill.
7. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
and noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.
8. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed, the applicant
shall conduct a preliminary site investigation on the portion of the site
that is judged to be the best candidate hydrogeologically for possible
infiltration, including gathering data from published sources, a field
inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a minimum of two
percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G. This investigation will
determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal high water table, soil
permeability and location of special geologic features, if applicable. The
location(s) of special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified
geotechnical professional. The requirements of this section are not
§ 26-424 SALISBURY CODE § 26-424
FWD:776
required for the carbonate areas shown on the Salisbury Township
Carbonate Overlay Map if no infiltration is proposed.
9. For entirely noncarbonate sites, the WQv shall be infiltrated unless the
applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to infiltrate the WQv for
reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability rate, soil depth or
isolation distances; or except as provided in § 26-424, Subsection 20.
The preliminary site investigation described in § 26-424, Subsection 8,
shall continue on different areas of the site until a suitable infiltration
location is found or the entire site is determined to be infeasible for
infiltration. For proposed infiltration areas, the additional site
investigation and testing as outlined in Appendix G shall be completed.
The municipality may determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are
known existing conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use
of infiltration. The following conditions are suitable for infiltration in
noncarbonate areas:
A. Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
B. Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet. (If the depth to bedrock is
between two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high
water table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the
depth to seasonal high water table is required.)
C. Soil permeability greater than or equal to 0.5 inch/hour and less
than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
D. Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Ten feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(4) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(5) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from wells, foundations
and drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full WQv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the WQv that is feasible based on the
site characteristics.
10. In entirely carbonate areas, if infiltration is proposed, in addition to the
testing required in § 26-424, Subsection 8, the preliminary site
§ 26-424 FOREWORD § 26-424
FWD:777
investigation shall include an assessment of the remainder of the site
for possible infiltration based on required isolation distances from
special geologic features and the likely soil depth and permeability
based on published data or other site data available. Where infiltration
BMPs are proposed, the applicant shall conduct the additional site
investigation and testing as outlined in Appendix G. The soil depth,
percolation rate and proposed loading rate, each weighted as described
in § 26-427, along with the buffer from special geologic features shall
be compared to the recommendation chart for infiltration stormwater
management BMPs in carbonate bedrock in Appendix D to determine
if the site is recommended for infiltration. If at any point in the
preliminary site investigation the data (e.g., location of Karst features
on the site or the published soils data for the site) indicates that
the entire site will not be recommended for infiltration based on the
ordinance standards, then no further investigation is required. In
addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the following
conditions are required for infiltration in carbonate areas:
A. Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
B. Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet. (If the depth to bedrock is
between two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high
water table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the
depth to seasonal high water table is required.)
C. Soil permeability greater than or equal to 0.5 inch/hour and less
than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
D. Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Ten feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(4) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from wells, foundations
and drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
Applicants are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a
carbonate site even if the site falls in the recommended range
on the chart in Appendix D. If infiltration is not proposed, the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs, as specified in
§ 26-424, Subsection 15.
11. If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall
investigate the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully
meet this Part to control runoff for the whole site through infiltration. If
§ 26-424 SALISBURY CODE § 26-424
FWD:778
that proves infeasible, the applicant shall perform the preliminary site
investigation for the carbonate area to determine the appropriate
design strategy. No infiltration structure in the noncarbonate area shall
be located within 50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except
when a preliminary site investigation has been done showing the
absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed
infiltration area.
12. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment
two-year-runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or
more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion of
the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
13. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
14. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case, may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet this requirement. Acceptable BMPs are listed
below along with the recommended reference for design.

16. The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use areas.
17. Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special
geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be
discharged into existing on-site sinkholes.
18. Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I Wellhead Protection radius, as calculated by the method
outlined in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Wellhead Protection regulations, for any public water supply well
within 400 feet of the site. In addition to the setback distances specified
in § 26-424, Subsections 9 and 10, infiltration is prohibited in the Zone I
radius as defined and substantiated by the public water supplier in
writing. If the applicant does not receive a response from the public
water supplier, the Zone I radius is assumed to be 100 feet.
19. The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the
regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical
degradation of receiving waters from such effects as scour and
streambank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements.

§ 26-425. Stormwater Management Districts. [Ord. 07-2005-523, 7/
28/2005, § 305]
20. The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law, including, but not
limited to, the Clean Streams Law.
1. Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts. To implement the
provisions of the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Stormwater
Management Plan, the municipality is hereby divided into Stormwater
Management Districts consistent with the Little Lehigh Creek Release
Rate Map presented in the Plan. The boundaries of the Stormwater
Management Districts are shown on an official map which is available
for inspection at the municipal office. A copy of the official map at a
reduced scale is included in Appendix A for general reference.74
2. Description of Stormwater Management Districts. Two types of
Stormwater Management Districts may be applicable to the
municipality, namely Conditional No Detention Districts and Dual
Release Rate Districts as described below.
A. Conditional No Detention Districts. Within these districts, the
capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities (as defined in
Subpart B) must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity
exists. For this determination, the developer must calculate peak
flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the
remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition. The
developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire
local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new
development would use the runoff controls specified by this Part.
The larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in
determining if adequate capacity exists. If adequate capacity exists
to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel (as
defined in Subpart B), these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment
peak runoff without detention facilities. If the
capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance
facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall either use a
100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of
downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent
with § 26-426, Subsection 16. Any capacity improvements must be
designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary
to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified
in § 26-426, Subsection 4. By definition, a storm drainage problem
area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates
that adequate capacity does not exist.

§ 26-426. Stormwater Management District Implementation
Provisions. [Ord. 07-2005-523, 7/28/2005, § 306]
B. Dual Release Rate Districts. Within this district, the two-year postdevelopment
peak runoff must be controlled to 30% of the
predevelopment two-year runoff peak. Further, the ten-year,
twenty-five-year and one-hundred-year post-development peak
runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the
predevelopment peak. Release rates associated with the tenthrough
one-hundred-year events vary from 50% to 100%
depending upon location in the watershed.
1. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post-construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of
discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this Part.
2. Any stormwater management controls required by this Part and subject
to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate
criteria for each of the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology
specified in § 26-427.
3. The exact location of the Stormwater Management District boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The District boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
4. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
Part shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year-return-period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year-return-period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
§ 26-425 FOREWORD § 26-426
FWD:785
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year-return-period
runoff.
5. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from
the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
6. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas re-combine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the
overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
7. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional no detention
subarea, a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate
control may not be drained to the discharge point(s) located in the no
detention subarea except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver
procedure.
8. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Little Lehigh Creek
Watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or
hardship waiver procedure.
9. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s) or (b) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where (b) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
§ 26-426, Subsection 4, and the minimum orifice criteria.
10. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in § 26-426, Subsection 4, and the detention criteria in
§ 26-427.
11. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
§ 26-426 SALISBURY CODE § 26-426
FWD:786
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in
series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
12. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
13. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this Part.
14. No Harm Water Quantity Option.
A. For any proposed development site not located in a conditional no
detention district, the developer has the option of using a less
restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the developer
can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed
development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging
at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the Plan. Special
circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of
the development itself not specifically considered in the
development of the Plan runoff control strategy. Proof of no harm
would have to be shown from the development site through the
remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence
of the creek with the Lehigh River. Proof of no harm must be shown
using the capacity criteria specified in § 26-426, Subsection 4, if
downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification.
B. Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow
versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following
provisions:
(1) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated
watershed model for the Little Lehigh Creek or as calculated
by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the
municipality. The flow values from the watershed model would
be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request.
(2) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system
as documented by a developer may be used by the developer
only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to
the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified
capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped
acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).

FWD:787
§ 26-427. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 07-2005-523, 7/28/2005,
§ 307]
(3) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with § 26-426,
Subsection 16.
C. Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Subpart D.
15. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
16. Capacity Improvements.
A. In certain instances, primarily within the conditional no detention
areas, local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels
of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire
watershed. In these instances, if the developer could prove that it
would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the
capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff
controls on the development site. Peak flow calculations shall be
done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition
and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per
current zoning and using the specified runoff controls. Any capacity
improvements would be designed using the larger of the above
peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in Subsection 4. All
new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the
proposed development site is located shall be assumed to
implement the developer's proposed discharge control, if any.
B. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
§ 26-426 SALISBURY CODE § 26-427
FWD:788
2. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the recommendation chart
for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in
Appendix D shall be calculated as follows:
(Area Tributary to infiltration BMP\Base area of infiltration BMP)
*100%
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
All disturbed areas to be made
impervious:
Weight at 100%
All disturbed areas to be made
pervious:
Weight at 50%
All undisturbed pervious areas: Weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: Weight at 100%
3. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the recommendation
chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix H is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability, as follows:
Permeability Range Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
* If the permeability rate falls on a break between two thickness
factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 in./hr. or less than 0.5
in./hr. are not recommended for infiltration.
4. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this Part shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the storage indication method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the rational method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be either the Universal Rational Hydrograph or the
modified rational method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes
detention volume. Use of the modified rational hydrograph shall be
consistent with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the
Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrograph Method (1987).
5. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
§ 26-427 FOREWORD § 26-427
FWD:789
6. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
7. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows.
8. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum one-foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the twothrough
twenty-five-year-runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall be
provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-yearrunoff
event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two- through onehundred-
year-storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year-return frequency storm peak basin inflow
rate with a minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the top of basin.
The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site areas
tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention
facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design of
the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105 regulations, and
may be required to pass a storm greater than the one-hundred-year
event.
9. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser
size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
acceptable provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities.
10. Runoff calculations using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall depths for the
various return periods to be used consistent with this Part may be taken
from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 or the PennDOT Intensity - Duration -
Frequency Field Manual ("PDT-IDF") (May 1986) for Region 4. The
following values are taken from the PDT-IDF Field Manual:
Return Period 24-Hour Rainfall Depth
1-year 2.40 inches
2-year 3.00 inches
5-year 3.60 inches
10-year 4.56 inches
25-year 5.52 inches
50-year 6.48 inches
100-year 7.44 inches
§ 26-427 SALISBURY CODE § 26-427
FWD:790
A graphical and tabular presentation of the Type II twenty-four hour
distribution is included in Appendix C.
11. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and the Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves as
presented in Appendix C.
12. Runoff curve numbers (CNs) to be used in the soil-cover-complex
method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix C.
13. Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in Appendix C.
14. All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
A. Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the soil-cover-complex method.
B. Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from
the watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure
3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
C. Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the
table presented in Appendix C.
D. Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning equation assuming full flow and the
Manning 'n' values from Appendix C.
15. If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
If using the Rational Method, all post-development calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
16. The Manning equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix C or other appropriate
standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities shall be
determined by methods acceptable to the municipality.

4. Earthmoving for all regulated activities under § 26-405 shall be
conducted in accordance with the current federal and state regulations
relative to the NPDES and DEP Chapter 102 regulations.
1. The municipality shall review the drainage plan, including the BMP
Operations and Maintenance Plan, for consistency with the adopted
Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Stormwater Management Plan as
embodied by this Part and with any permits issued by DEP. The
municipality shall also review the drainage plan against any additional
storm drainage provisions contained in the municipal Subdivision and
Land Development or Zoning Ordinance, as applicable.
2. The municipality shall notify the applicant in writing whether the BMP
Operations and Maintenance Plan is approved.
3. The municipality shall not approve any subdivision or land development
[regulated activities, § 26-405, Subsections 2A and B] or building

1. The municipality may hear requests for waivers where it is alleged that
the provisions of this Part inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The waiver request shall be in writing and accompanied by
§ 26-434 SALISBURY CODE § 26-437
FWD:796
the requisite fee based upon a fee schedule adopted by the municipality.
A copy of the waiver request shall be provided to each of the following:
municipality, municipal engineer, municipal solicitor and Lehigh Valley
Planning Commission. The request shall fully document the nature of
the alleged hardship.
2. The municipality may grant a waiver provided that all of the following
findings are made in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this Part in the Stormwater
Management District in which the property is located;
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Part, including the no harm
provisions, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
D. That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue; and
E. That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship
waiver.
In granting any waiver, the municipality may attach such
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this Part. If a hardship waiver is granted, the
applicant must still manage the quantity, velocity, direction and
quality of resulting storm runoff as is necessary to prevent injury
to health, safety or other property.

CATASAUQUA CREEK AND ADJACENT WATERSHEDS, ACT 167
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
A.
General Provisions.
§ 26-501. Short Title. [Ord. 03-2007-532, 3/22/2007, § 101]
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Catasauqua Creek and
Adjacent Watersheds, Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 26-502. Statement of Findings. [Ord. 03-2007-532, 3/22/2007,
§ 102]
1. The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic patterns, destroys
aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and
loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and
control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental
to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the
people of the municipality and all of the people of the
commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
F. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer
systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth
by the municipality.93

A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities which cause such problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage
systems.
C. Encourage infiltration of stormwater, where appropriate, to
maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
D. Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and
watercourses in the municipality and the commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide for proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management BMPs that are implemented in the municipality.
G. Provide review procedures and performance standards for
stormwater planning, design and management.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
I. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support
those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality
in "special protection" streams.
J. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.

1. This Part shall only apply to those areas of the municipality which are
located within the Catasauqua Creek and Adjacent Watersheds,(s) as
delineated on an official map available for inspection at the municipal
office. A map of the Catasauqua Creek and Adjacent Watersheds,(s) at a
reduced scale is included in Appendix A for general reference.95
(Municipalities subject to the NPDES Phase II regulations must ensure
that all of the ordinance provisions required to meet the MS4 NPDES
requirements apply across the entire municipality.)
2. The following activities are defined as regulated activities and shall be
governed by this Part:
A. Land development.
B. Subdivision.
C. Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces (driveways,
parking lots, etc.).
D. Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
E. Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
F. Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto.
G. Regulated earth disturbance activities.96
1. Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in § 26-505, Subsections 2E and F, which would create 10,000 square
feet or less of additional impervious cover is exempt from the drainage
plan preparation provisions of this Part. All of the impervious cover
added incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall
be subject to the drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part. If a
site has previously received an exemption and is proposing additional
development such that the total impervious cover on the site exceeds
10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site proposed
since the original ordinance date must meet the provisions of this Part.
A. The date of the municipal Ordinance adoption of the original
Catasauqua Creek and Adjacent Watersheds Act 167 Stormwater
Management Ordinance (Watershed Plan date) shall be the starting

plan must be used in determining conformance with these criteria.
C. Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways,
storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway
areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or
for the proposed regulated activity.
D. Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed stone,
porous pavement, etc., shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing
gravel, crushed stone or hard packed soil areas on a site shall be
considered as pervious cover for the purpose of exemption
evaluation.
2. Prior Drainage Plan Approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this Part is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part, except as cited in
§ 26-506, Subsection 3, provided that the approved drainage plan
included design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site
currently proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance
provisions in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not
lapsed under the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant revisions
are made to the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval
and the effective date of this Part, preparation of a new drainage plan,
subject to the provisions of this Part, shall be required. Significant
revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques,
relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original
drainage plan.
3. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property, and
state water quality requirements. These measures include adequate
and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site.
These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.

instances of like kind and character.
C. The words "shall" and "must" are mandatory; the words "may" and
"should" are permissive.
2. Terms Defined.
ACCELERATED EROSION  The removal of the surface of the land
through the combined action of human activities and natural processes,
at a rate greater than would occur because of the natural processes
alone.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
measures or procedures used to manage stormwater quantity and
quality impacts from the regulated activities listed in § 26-505, to meet
state water quality requirements, to promote groundwater recharge
and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Part.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE
PLAN  Documentation, included as part of a drainage plan, detailing
the proposed BMPs, how they will be operated and maintained and who
will be responsible.
BIORETENTION  Densely vegetated, depressed features that store
stormwater and filter it through vegetation, mulch, planting soil, etc.
Ultimately stormwater is evapotranspirated, infiltrated, or discharged.
Optimal bioretention areas mimic natural forest ecosystems in terms of
species diversity, density, distribution, use of native plants, etc.
BUFFER 
STREAMSIDE BUFFER  A zone of variable width located along
a stream that is vegetated and is designed to filter pollutants from
runoff.
A.
SPECIAL GEOLOGIC FEATURE BUFFER  A required isolation
distance from a special geologic feature to a proposed BMP needed
B.
§ 26-511 FOREWORD § 26-511
FWD:821
CAPTURE/REUSE  Stormwater management techniques such as
cisterns and rain barrels which direct runoff into storage devices,
surface or subsurface, for later re-use, such as for irrigation of gardens
and other planted areas. Because this stormwater is utilized and no
pollutant discharge results, water quality performance is superior to
other noninfiltration BMPs.
CARBONATE BEDROCK  Rock consisting chiefly of carbonate
minerals, such as limestone and dolomite; specifically a sedimentary
rock composed of more than 50% by weight of carbonate minerals that
underlies soil or other unconsolidated, superficial material.
CISTERN  An underground reservoir or tank for storing rainwater.
CLOSED DEPRESSION  A distinctive bowl-shaped depression in the
land surface. It is characterized by internal drainage, varying
magnitude, and an unbroken ground surface.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  The Lehigh or Northampton County
Conservation District, as applicable.
CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS  "Constructed wetlands" are similar to
wet ponds (see below) and consist of a basin which provides for
necessary stormwater storage as well as a permanent pool or water
level, planted with wetland vegetation. To be successful, "constructed
wetlands" must have adequate natural hydrology (both runoff inputs
as well as soils and water table which allow for maintenance of a
permanent pool of water). In these cases, the permanent pool must be
designed carefully, usually with shallow edge benches, so that water
levels are appropriate to support carefully selected wetland vegetation.
CULVERT  A pipe, conduit or similar structure, including appurtenant
works which carries surface water.
DAM  An artificial barrier, together with its appurtenant works,
constructed for the purpose of impounding or storing water or another
fluid or semifluid or a refuse bank, fill or structure for highway, railroad
or other purposes which does or may impound water or another fluid or
semifluid.
DEP  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM  The depth and time distribution of precipitation
from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence (e.g., onehundred-
year storm) and duration (e.g. twenty-four-hour) and used in
computing stormwater management control systems.
DETENTION BASIN  A basin designed to retard stormwater runoff
by temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at the appropriate
release rate.
to reduce the risk of sinkhole formation due to stormwater
management activities.
§ 26-511 SALISBURY CODE § 26-511
FWD:822
DEVELOPER  A person, partnership, association, corporation or other
entity, or any responsible person therein or agent thereof, that
undertakes any regulated activity of this Part.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE)  The specific tract of land for which a
regulated activity is proposed.
DIFFUSED DRAINAGE  See "sheet flow."
DRAINAGE EASEMENT  A right granted by a landowner to a grantee,
allowing the use of private land for stormwater management purposes.
DRAINAGE PLAN  The documentation of the proposed stormwater
quantity and quality management controls to be used for a given
development site, including a BMP Operations and Maintenance Plan,
the contents of which are established in § 26-533.
EARTH DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY  A construction or other human
activity which disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited
to, clearing and grubbing, grading, excavations, embankments, road
maintenance, building construction and the moving, depositing,
stockpiling or storing of soil, rock or earth materials.
EROSION  The removal of soil particles by the action of water, wind,
ice, or other geological agents.
EXISTING USES  Those uses actually attained in the water body on
or after November 28, 1975, whether or not they are included in the
water quality standards (25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.1)
FILL  Man-made deposits of natural soils or rock products and waste
materials.
FILTER STRIPS  See "vegetated buffers."
FREEBOARD  The incremental depth in a stormwater management
structure, provided as a safety factor of design, above that required to
convey the design runoff event.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE  Replenishment of existing natural
underground water supplies.
HARDSHIP WAIVER REQUEST  A written request for a waiver

Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a "designated use," such
as "cold water fishes" or "potable water supply," which is listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under
state regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway, to prevent these impacts.

stormwater management requirements of this Part.
2. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unobstructed flow
in natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities, recharge facilities, water quality facilities, pipe systems or
open channels consistent with this Part.
3. The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written approval of the
affected property owner(s).
4. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this Part. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and
discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document that
there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely
transport the concentrated discharge to the point of predevelopment
flow concentration, to the stream reach or otherwise prove that no
harm will result from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing
diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release
rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they
are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage
areas.
5. Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a
one-hundred-year floodplain is defined by the municipality, there shall
be provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the line
of such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unobstructed flow of storm runoff based on calculations
made in conformance with § 26-527 for the one-hundred-year return
period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot above the
design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper
runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the onehundred-
year floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable

Sediment Control Plan for construction activities. Written approval by
DEP or a delegated County Conservation District shall satisfy this
requirement.
2. An Erosion and Sediment Control Plan is required by DEP regulations
for any Earth Disturbance Activity of 5,000 square feet or more under
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
3. A DEP NPDES Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities Permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality before the
commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
5. A copy of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this Part. This Part provides standards to
meet NPDES Permit requirements associated with construction
activities and MS4 permit requirements.
2. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways. First, WQv shall be calculated using
the following formula:
WQv = (c)(P)(A)\12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
c = Rational Method post-development runoff coefficient
for the two-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
§ 26-522 FOREWORD § 26-524
FWD:833
Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff volume
from pre-development to post-development for the two-year return
period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site shall be
considered in this calculation. The larger of these two calculated
volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and treated, except
that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to exceed 1.25 inches of
runoff over the site area. This standard does not limit the volume of
infiltration an applicant may propose for purposes of water quantity/
peak rate control.
3. The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
4. If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet
pond, constructed wetland or other BMP that ponds water on the land
surface and may receive direct sunlight, the discharge from that BMP
must be treated by infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip,
bioretention, vegetated swale or other BMP that provides a thermal
benefit to protect the high quality waters of the Catasauqua Creek and
Adjacent Watershed from thermal impacts.
5. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
§ 26-524, Subsection 15, except for minor areas on the periphery of the
site that cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other
BMP.
6. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration
BMP standards of this Part.
7. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
and non-carbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.
8. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G.102 This
investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal
high water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified
Sewage Enforcement Officer (SEO) except that the location(s) of
special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical
professional.

following criteria:
A. Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
B. Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet, except for infiltration of
residential roof runoff where the seasonal high water table must be
below the invert of the BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between
two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth
to seasonal high water table is required.)
C. Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15,
percolation test in Appendix G103) greater than or equal to 0.5 inch/
hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
D. Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations, except for residential development where the
required setback is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet upgradient
from building foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields, except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic
system drainfields.
(4) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(5) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential
future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring
properties will be met, except for one- and two-family
residential dwellings where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks
from existing or potential future wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
10. For entirely non-carbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in § 26-524,
Subsection 21.
103. Editor's Note: Appendix G is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-524 FOREWORD § 26-524

A. The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25)* (I)/12
Where:
Rev = Recharge volume in acre-feet
I = Impervious area in acres
B. The preliminary site investigation described in § 26-524,
Subsection 8, is required and shall continue on different areas of
the site until a potentially suitable infiltration location is found or
the entire site is determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For
infiltration areas that appear to be feasible based on the
preliminary site investigation, the additional site investigation and
testing as outlined in Appendix G shall be completed.
C. If an applicant proposes infiltration, the municipality may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing
conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of
infiltration.
D. The site must meet the conditions listed in § 26-524, Subsection 9.
E. If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be
considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as
described in § 26-524, Subsection 15.
F. If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to
be captured and treated.
11. In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to use
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
§ 26-524, Subsection 8, shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that
appear feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the
applicant shall conduct the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed
loading rate, each weighted as described in § 26-527, along with the
buffer from special geologic features shall be compared to the
Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs
in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D to determine if the site is
recommended for infiltration. In addition to the recommendation from
Appendix D, the conditions listed in § 26-524, Subsection 15, are
required for infiltration in carbonate areas.104 Applicants are
encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as calculated in § 26-524, Subsection
10, but are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a carbonate site
even if the site falls in the "Recommended" range on the chart in
Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be subtracted from
104. Editor's Note: Appendices D and G are included as attachments to this chapter.

the WQv to be treated by non-infiltration BMPs. If infiltration is not
proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs, as
specified in § 26-524, Subsection 15.
12. If a site has both carbonate and non-carbonate areas, the applicant
shall investigate the ability of the non-carbonate portion of the site to
fully meet this Part to meet the requirements for REv for the whole site
through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the
carbonate area as described in § 26-524, Subsection 11, or two other
noninfiltration BMPs as described in § 26-524, Subsection 15, must be
used. No infiltration structure in the non-carbonate area shall be
located within 50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except
when a preliminary site investigation has been done showing the
absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed
infiltration area.
13. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment
two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or
more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion of
the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
14. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
15. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet the requirement of this section. Acceptable BMPs
are listed below along with the recommended reference for design.

§ 26-525. Stormwater Management Districts. [Ord. 03-2007-532, 3/
22/2007, § 305]
20. The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the
regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical
degradation of receiving waters from such effects as scour and
streambank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements,
by controlling the two-year post-development runoff to a 30% release
rate.
21. The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law including but not
limited to the Clean Streams Law.
1. Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts. To implement the
provisions of the Catasauqua Creek and Adjacent Watersheds,
Stormwater Management Plan, the municipality is hereby divided into
Stormwater Management Districts consistent with the Catasauqua
Creek Release Rate Map presented in the Plan Update. The boundaries
of the Stormwater Management Districts are shown on an official map
which is available for inspection at the municipal office. A copy of the
official map at a reduced scale is included in Appendix A for general
reference.105
2. Description of Stormwater Management Districts. Two types of
Stormwater Management Districts may be applicable to the
municipality, namely Conditional/Provisional No Detention Districts and
Dual Release Rate Districts as described below.
A. Conditional/Provisional No Detention Districts. Within these
districts, the capacity of the "local" runoff conveyance facilities (as
defined in § 26-511) must be calculated to determine if adequate
capacity exists. For this determination, the developer must
calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the
existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this Part. The larger of the two peak flows calculated
will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists. If adequate
capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main
channel (as defined in § 26-511), these watershed areas may
discharge post-development peak runoff without detention
facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the "local" runoff
conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall
either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased
capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows
105. Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the Township offices.
§ 26-524 SALISBURY CODE § 26-525
FWD:842
§ 26-526. Stormwater Management District Implementation
Provisions. [Ord. 03-2007-532, 3/22/2007, § 306]
consistent with § 26-526, Subsection 16. Any capacity
improvements must be designed to convey runoff from
development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent
with the capacity criteria specified in § 26-526, Subsection 4. By
definition, a storm drainage problem area associated with the
"local" runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity
does not exist. Sites in these districts are still required to meet all
of the water quality requirements in § 26-524.
B. Dual Release Rate Districts. Within these districts, the two-year
post-development peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the
predevelopment two-year runoff peak. Further, the ten-, twentyfive-
and one-hundred-year post-development peak runoff must be
controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak.
Release rates associated with the ten- through one-hundred-year
events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the
watershed.
1. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post-construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of
discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this Part.
2. Any stormwater management controls required by this Part and subject
to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate
criteria for each of the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology
specified in § 26-527.
3. The exact location of the Stormwater Management District boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The District boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
4. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
Part shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
§ 26-525 FOREWORD § 26-526
FWD:843
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
5. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from
the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
6. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas re-combine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate, provided that
the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
7. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a Conditional/Provisional No
Detention Subarea, the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a
site may not be changed post-development to create potentially adverse
conditions on downstream properties except as part of a "no harm" or
hardship waiver procedure.
8. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Catasauqua Creek
and Adjacent Watersheds, and any adjacent watershed except as part of
a "no harm" or hardship waiver procedure.
9. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s) or (b) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where (b) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
§ 26-526, Subsection 4, and the minimum orifice criteria.
§ 26-526 SALISBURY CODE § 26-526
FWD:844
10. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in § 26-526, Subsection 4, and the detention criteria in
§ 26-527.
11. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
12. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
13. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this Part.
14. "No Harm" Water Quantity Option.
A. For any proposed development site not located in a Conditional/
Provisional No Detention District, the developer has the option of
using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the
developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the
proposed development site and that "no harm" would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the Plan.
Special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic
aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the
development of the Plan runoff control strategy. Proof of "no harm"
would have to be shown from the development site through the
remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence
of the creek with the Delaware or Lehigh River. Proof of "no harm"
must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in § 26-526,
Subsection 4, if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the "no
harm" justification.
B. Attempts to prove "no harm" based upon downstream peak flow
versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following
provisions:
(1) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated PSRM
Model for the Catasauqua Creek and Adjacent Watersheds or
§ 26-526 FOREWORD § 26-526
FWD:845
as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method
acceptable to the municipality. The flow values from the PSRM
Model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality
upon request.
(2) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system
as documented by a developer may be used by the developer
only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to
the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified
capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped
acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
(3) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove "no harm," except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with § 26-526,
Subsection 4.
C. Any "no harm" justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Subpart D. Developers
submitting "no harm" justifications must still meet all of the water
quality requirements in § 26-524.
15. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
16. Capacity Improvements.
A. In certain instances, primarily within the Conditional/Provisional
No Detention areas, local drainage conditions may dictate more
stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection
of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could
prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to
relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then
the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in
lieu of runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow
calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in
the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed
is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff
controls. Any capacity improvements would be designed using the
larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in
§ 26-526, Subsection 4. All new development in the entire
§ 26-526 SALISBURY CODE § 26-526
FWD:846
§ 26-527. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 03-2007-532, 3/22/2007,
§ 307]
subarea(s) within which the proposed development site is located
shall be assumed to implement the developer's proposed discharge
control, if any.
B. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified "no harm" option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
2. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D shall be calculated as follows:
(Area tributary to infiltration BMP\Base area of infiltration BMP)*100%
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
All disturbed areas to be made
impervious:
Weight at 100%
All disturbed areas to be made
pervious:
Weight at 50%
All undisturbed pervious areas: Weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: Weight at 100%
3. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability (as measured by the
adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15, percolation test in Appendix G), as
follows:106
Permeability Range* Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
106. Editor's Note: Appendices D and G are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 26-526 FOREWORD § 26-527
FWD:847
* If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code
§ 73.15, percolation test in Appendix G) falls on a break between
two thickness factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12 inches/hour or less than
0.5 inch/hour as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15,
percolation test in Appendix G, are not recommended for infiltration.
4. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this Part shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the storage indication method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be either the Universal Rational Hydrograph or the
Modified Rational Method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes
detention volume. Use of the Modified Rational hydrograph shall be
consistent with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the
Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrology Model (1987).
5. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
6. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
7. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows.
8. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum one-foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the twothrough
twenty-five-year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall be
provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two- through onehundred-
year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow
rate with a minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the top of basin.
The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site areas
tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention
facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design of
the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105 regulations, and
may be required to pass a storm greater than the one-hundred-year
event.
9. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser
size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
§ 26-527 SALISBURY CODE § 26-527
FWD:848

including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this Part in the Stormwater
Management District in which the property is located;
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Part, including the "no harm"

2015]
A. The erection, construction, movement, placement or extension of a

1. Fee Schedule. The Board of Commissioners has established by
resolution a schedule of fees and a collection procedure relating to all

overlay zoning district regulates the same matter as another provision
of this chapter, the overlay zoning district shall apply in place of the
other provision.

approval under the requirements and procedures of this section. After

public notice.
3. Review of Amendments.
A. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by or under
the direction of the Planning Commission, the Board of
Commissioners shall submit each such amendment to the Planning
Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such proposed
amendment and permit the Commission an opportunity to provide
recommendations.

to the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission (LVPC) for
recommendations at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such
proposed amendment. No action shall be taken by the Board of
Commissioners until any LVPC comments are received, unless 30
days pass without such comments being received.
4. Changes after a Hearing. If, after any public hearing held upon an
amendment, the proposed amendment is changed substantially or is
revised to include land previously not affected by it, the Board of
Commissioners shall hold another public hearing, pursuant to public
notice, before proceeding to vote on the amendment.
5. Application for Chapter Amendment. Any request for amendment of this

6. Traffic Studies of Zoning Amendments. The Planning Commission or the
Board of Commissioners may require an applicant for a zoning
amendment to fund a traffic impact study following standard methods
and completed by a qualified traffic engineer. Such a study shall take
into account the entire land area proposed for a change, with an
emphasis on the net projected traffic increases from the proposed
amendment compared to the existing zoning, based upon reasonable
assumptions about the intensity and type of development. See § 27-810,
"Traffic Studies."
7. Notification of Proposed Zoning Map Amendment. If a Zoning Map
amendment is requested by a private entity and is not considered at the
same public hearing as Zoning Map amendments proposed by Township

change the applicant shall send or have delivered in person written
notice of the proposed change including the hearing date and time and

properly requested in writing and submitted together with any required
fees to the Zoning Officer outside of the curative amendment process,

§ 27-112. Zoning Hearing Board Appointment, Actions and
Variances.
determining that there has been a violation, further determines that
there was a good-faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation
violating the chapter to have believed that there was no such violation,
in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation, until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the District Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees collected for the violation of this chapter

in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business, or use
constituting a violation.
B. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice
of that action shall be served upon the municipality at least 30 days

five residents of the Township appointed by the Board of
Commissioners, unless a differing number of members is
authorized by another valid Township ordinance. Alternate

P.S. § 10101 et seq. Members of the Board shall hold no elected
office in the Township.
B. Wards. One member of the Board should be appointed from each
ward of the Township. If a member would move from the ward in
which he/she resided at the time of his/her appointment to the
Board, to another ward in the Township, such move should not
cause forfeiture of that member's appointment or grounds for
removal of that member from the Board; but upon the expiration of
that member's term on the Board, that member shall not be
§ 27-111 SALISBURY CODE § 27-112
FWD:882
reappointed to the Board except as the member from the ward in
which he/she resides at the time.
C. Wards. The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to
determine whether Zoning Hearing Board members are appointed
based upon their ward of residence or not. The Board may decide to
appoint one member who lives in each ward.
D. Terms. Members shall be appointed to three-year terms, with at
least one position expiring each year.
2. Vacancies. The Board shall promptly notify the Board of Commissioners
of any vacancies which occur. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be
only for the unexpired portion of a term.
3. Removal of Members. See MPC, 53 P.S. § 10905.
4. Organization.
A. Officers. The Board shall elect officers from its own membership.
Officers shall serve annual terms and may succeed themselves.
B. Quorum. For the conduct of any hearing and taking of any action, a
quorum shall be not less than a majority of all members of the
Board, except that the Board may appoint a hearing officer from its
own membership to conduct any hearing on its behalf and the
parties may waive further action by the Board, as provided by the
MPC, 53 P.S. § 10908 et seq.
C. Rules. The Board may make, alter, and rescind rules and forms for
its procedure, consistent with all applicable Township ordinances
and state law.
5. Zoning Hearing Board Functions. In addition to any other
responsibilities established by the MPC (such as within Section
909.1),110 the Zoning Hearing Board shall be responsible for the
following:
A. Appeal of a Decision by the Zoning Officer.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant (a person affected or any agency of the Township)
that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed
procedures or has misinterpreted or misapplied any valid
provision of this chapter.
(2) See time limitations for appeals in § 27-112, Subsection 6.
B. Challenge to the Validity of this Chapter or Map.
110. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10909.1.
§ 27-112 FOREWORD § 27-112
FWD:883
(1) The Board shall hear challenges to the validity of this chapter
filed with the Board in writing by the landowner affected, any
officer or agency of the Township, or any person aggrieved.
(2) After the conclusion of the hearing(s), the Board shall decide
all questions and shall make findings on all relevant issues of
fact, within the time limits of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
C. Variances.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances filed with the
Board in writing by any landowner (or any tenant with the
permission of such landowner).
(2) Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the
limitations of state law. As of 2013, the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10101 et
seq., provided that all of the following findings must be made,
where relevant:
(a) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(b) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and
a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property.
(c) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(3) Variance Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. The
Board may, in various cases, prohibit certain permitted uses on
a lot where the Board finds that such uses would be contrary to
§ 27-112 SALISBURY CODE § 27-112
FWD:884
the public interest considering the facts and circumstances of
the case and the variance.
D. Special Exception Uses.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Board in writing by any landowner (or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner), as provided
in this chapter and in accordance with such standards and
criteria contained in this chapter and the procedures in
§ 27-120.
(2) Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning
Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the chapter, as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes and intent of
this chapter.
(3) See special exception use process in § 27-120.
E. Hearings. See § 27-113.
F. Records and Reports. The staff to the Board shall keep full public
records of its business.
G. Court Appeals. In the case of an appeal from the Board to the Court
of Common Pleas, the appellant shall make the return required by
law and should promptly notify the Township Zoning Hearing Board
Solicitor of such appeal.
H. Appeal by the Zoning Officer. See § 27-106, Subsection 4.
I. Persons with Disabilities. Process for claims resolution of a Zoning
Ordinance provision that may conflict with federal law and/or court
decisions concerning persons with disabilities.
(1) A complete written application for the claim must be submitted
to the Zoning Officer that fully describes the claim and
identifies the Zoning Ordinance provision(s) in question. The
application shall be on the form that the Zoning Hearing Board
uses for special exceptions, unless another form is provided by
the Township.
(2) The Zoning Hearing Board shall then hear the request as a
special exception.
(3) The Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special exception
allowing modification(s) to specific requirements of this
chapter if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Hearing Board that the modification(s) are required in order
for the Zoning Ordinance to comply with applicable federal law
and relevant federal and/or state court decisions.
§ 27-112 FOREWORD § 27-112
FWD:885
(4) The modification shall be needed to provide a "reasonable
accommodation" to serve persons who the applicant proves
have "disabilities" as defined in and protected by such laws.
(5) Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in
accordance with the United States Fair Housing Act
amendments and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act, as
amended, or their successor laws, or Pennsylvania state
regulations that are intended to carry out such laws.
(6) The applicant shall identify the disability which is protected by
such statutes and the extent of the modification(s) of the
provisions of this chapter that are necessary for a reasonable
accommodation.
(7) Any modification approved under this section may be limited to
the time period during which the persons with protected
disabilities occupy or utilize the premises.
6. Time Limits for Appeals. The time limitations for appeals shall be as
follows:
A. No person shall be allowed to file any appeal with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after the decision by the Zoning
Officer that is being appealed has been officially issued, or appeal
with the County Court of Common Pleas later than 30 days after a
decision of the Zoning Hearing Board has been officially issued,
except as may be provided under Section 914.1 of the Pennsylvania
MPC, 53 P.S. § 10914.1.
B. The failure of an aggrieved person other than the landowner to
appeal an adverse decision directly related to a preliminary
subdivision or land development plan shall preclude an appeal from
a final plan approval except in the case where the final submission
substantially deviates from the approved preliminary plan.
C. This thirty-day time limit for appeals shall not apply to the
revocation of a permit under § 27-108, Subsection 7.
7. Stay of Proceedings. See Section 916 of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10916 et
seq.111
8. Time Limits on Permits and Variances.
A. After a variance is approved or approval is officially authorized
under this chapter, then a permit shall be secured by the applicant
within 12 months after the date of such approval or authorization.
Such action under such permit shall then substantially begin within
12 months of the issuance of the permit.
111. Editor's Note: 53 P.S. § 10916 was repealed 12-21-1988 by P.L. 1329, No. 170.
§ 27-112 SALISBURY CODE § 27-112
FWD:886

B. If the applicant submits complete plans for a required site plan
review or subdivision or land development approval or special
exception or conditional use approval that is related to the variance
or issuance of a permit under this chapter within the above time
limits, then such time limits shall begin after such plan review is
completed or such plan approval is granted.
C. For good cause, the Zoning Officer may, upon application in writing
stating the reasons therefor, extend in writing the twelve-month
application period to up to 18 months.
D. If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits within the
above time period, or after they are obtained the permittee fails to
diligently commence substantial construction within 12 months or
allows interruptions in substantial construction of longer than six
months, it shall be conclusively presumed that the applicant has
waived, withdrawn or abandoned the approval, and all such
approvals, variances and permits shall be deemed automatically
rescinded.
E. Any building construction shall be completed within 36 months of
issuance of an applicable permit, unless a written extension is
granted by the Zoning Officer for good cause, or unless the project
was approved by the Township to be phased. Otherwise, a permit
shall be considered to have automatically expired at the end of such
thirty-six-month period.

1. Each site is unique, because it has physical features that are rarely the
same as other sites. Portions of some sites may not be usable. The
purpose of this section is to determine the appropriate intensity of use
to which a specific tract may be put, by netting out certain features that
are considered to be unbuildable from the total area of the site. This
section determines the maximum number of allowed lots and/or
structures, based upon the land's specific characteristics. All applicants
for preliminary plan approval or combined preliminary/final plan
approval of a subdivision or land development shall include maps and a
table that demonstrate compliance with this section.
2. Exceptions. This section shall not apply if any of the following situations
apply:
A. The application only involves an adjustment to the lot lines of one
or more existing lots and does not create a new lot; or
B. The application only involves revisions to a previously approved
subdivision or land development that does not increase the number
of approved lots or structures.
3. A map showing the locations of the natural resources and the following
natural resource site capacity calculations shall be submitted by the
applicant to determine the requirements for that lot or abutting lots.
Portions of a site which have overlapping protection restrictions shall
be subject to the highest protection ratio and shall be calculated only
once. For example, if a 25% steep slope is also in a power line right-ofway,
it shall be calculated as 25% slope and not double-counted as
power line right-of-way.
A. Base Site Area. The total lot area of abutting lots in common
ownership shall be considered the site area. The following acreage
shall be deleted from the site area to determine the ability of the
site to support the density/intensity of development, to result in the
net buildable site area.

4. Where a zoning district provides a standard minimum lot area in acres
(such as the CR District) in § 27-307, the net buildable site area shall be
divided by such minimum lot size to determine the maximum allowed
number of lots or dwelling units (whichever is more restrictive) allowed
on the site.
5. Where § 27-307 provides a standard minimum lot area in square feet for
a zoning district (such as the R1 District), the net buildable site area
shall be converted into square feet (with each acre equal to 43,560

square feet) and then shall be divided by such minimum lot size to
determine the maximum allowed number of lots or dwelling units
(whichever is more restrictive) allowed on the site.
6. For townhouses and apartments, the maximum density shall be
determined using the site capacity calculation in § 27-402 for such uses.
7. Where a zoning district or use establishes density through a maximum
number of units per acre, the net buildable site area in acres shall be
multiplied by that number of units per acre to determine the maximum
allowed number of dwelling units allowed on the site.
8. This site capacity requirement shall apply in addition to other
requirements of this chapter, such as steep slope regulations in
§ 27-505, based upon the building construction area.
Note: The applicant should be aware that the calculated maximum
density/number of lots is the maximum allowable, and there is
no guarantee that such density/number of lots will be possible
on a particular site, after considering all other requirements.
See also high water table soil regulations in § 27-504.
1. In General.
A. No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way
that it would result in another lot, building or use not being able to
meet the requirements of this chapter. This includes, but is not
limited to, setback areas, nonimpervious areas and off-street
parking areas.
B. Emergency Access. All uses and structures shall have adequate
provisions for access by emergency vehicles.
C. Setbacks Not Applicable. See exemptions for certain structures in
§ 27-306.
D. Accuracy. The applicant is responsible to make sure that all
measurements submitted to the Township are accurate.
E. Driveways on Corner Lots. Private driveways on corner lots serving
a single-family detached dwelling shall be located at least 40 feet
from the point of intersection of the nearest public street right-ofway
lines, unless the provisions of § 27-603, Subsection 4E, impose
a more-restrictive standard.
2. Exceptions to Minimum Lot Areas, Lot Widths and Yards.
A. Nonconforming Lots. See § 27-806.
§ 27-308 SALISBURY CODE § 27-309
FWD:954
B. Through Lots. Any lot having frontage on two approximately
parallel streets (not including an alley) shall provide a required
front yard setback abutting each of these streets.
C. Corner Lot Setback.
(1) A setback area equal to the minimum front yard setback shall
be provided along all portions of a corner lot abutting any
public street, except:
(a) Where the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Officer that the provision of a smaller setback or a
different yard for a residential building will conform with
the clearly prevailing yard pattern on numerous existing
developed adjoining lots fronting on the same street; or
(b) If the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Officer that such requirement cannot reasonably be met
within an existing lot, then the Zoning Officer may allow
the front yard on one street to be reduced to 60% of what
would otherwise be required, with the Zoning Officer
choosing which street may have the smaller setback based
upon the prevailing character in the area.
(2) A corner lot shall have one side yard and one rear yard.
D. Triangular Lots. A three-sided lot shall have one front yard, one
side yard and one rear yard.
E. Projections Into Required Yards. The following features may
project into required yards and shall not be considered in the
determination of building coverage:
(1) Patios, porches and decks that:
(a) May or may not be covered by a structural roof;
(b) Are not enclosed and do not have walls of mostly solid
material, glass or plastic;
(c) Are not closer than five feet to any side or rear lot line
(except zero feet is allowed along a shared lot line of
attached dwellings) and do not intrude more than 10 feet
into a required front yard; and
(d) Are not raised more than six feet above the surrounding
average ground level.
(2) Routinely projecting architectural features, such as bay
windows, cornices, eaves, fireplaces, chimneys, fire escapes or
windowsills which do not project more than five feet into any
required yard, or closer than five feet to any adjacent lot line of
§ 27-309 FOREWORD § 27-309
FWD:955
a single-family detached dwelling, whichever is more
restrictive.
(3) Stairs and landings that are not within enclosed walls,
provided such stairs or landings do not exceed six feet in
height.
(4) Open balconies, provided no supporting enclosed walls are
located within the required yard, and provided the balconies
do not project more than five feet into any required yard nor
closer than five feet to any adjacent lot line of a single-family
detached dwelling, whichever is more restrictive.
(5) Patios and decks that do not meet the standards of Subsection
2E(1) above, whether covered or uncovered, provided that
they:
(a) Are not enclosed and do not have walls mostly of solid
material, glass or plastic; and
(b) Extend into a maximum of 1/3 of the required rear yard
distance.
(6) See also Symbol* under the dimensional requirements for the
R4 and R5 Districts in § 27-307, Subsection 2B, which allows
certain reduced setbacks for additions to existing single-family
detached dwellings.
F. Patios and decks may project up to 1/3 of the width of the yard of a
corner lot abutting the second street.
G. Septic Systems. See § 27-507. Also, if impervious coverage is added
to an existing residential lot, see § 27-403, Subsection 4M(10).
H. Previously Approved Setbacks. Where a subdivision or land
development was granted final approval prior to the adoption of
this chapter and the lawful setbacks in effect at such time are
shown on the approved plans, at the option of the developer, those
approved setbacks may apply in place of any revised setbacks in
this chapter.
I. Front Yard Exceptions. When an unimproved residential lot is
situated between two or more lots with principal buildings with
principal building front yard setbacks with less depth than required
in that district, the minimum front yard shall be reduced to the
depth of such abutting improved lot that has the largest depth.
J. Special Building Setback Lines Established. On the following
streets, the depth of the required front yard shall be measured from
the following additional setback from the center line of the street
right-of-way as specified below, instead of from the street right-ofway
line, unless measurement from the required street right-of-way
line would be more restrictive. However, the setback required by
§ 27-309 SALISBURY CODE § 27-309
FWD:956
this § 27-309, Subsection 2J, may be reduced so that the principal
building would not be required to maintain a front yard setback
more than 10 feet greater than the setback permitted by § 27-309,

§ 27-310. Open Space Development Option for Land that is at Least
Partly Within the CR District.
1. This section allows an applicant the option to reduce the minimum lot
areas on tracts that are at least partly within the CR District if the
development would meet all of the following requirements:
A. Option for Tracts Entirely Within CR. The following requirements
shall apply to a tract of more than six acres that is entirely within
the CR District, in addition to the other requirements of this
subsection:
(1) The "net buildable site area" as provided in § 27-308 shall be
divided by 1.5 acres to determine the number of allowed
dwelling units. Each dwelling unit that has a construction area
of less than 15% shall have a minimum lot area of 1.5 acres.
(2) A minimum of 45% of the total tract shall be dedicated as
common open space within the requirements of this
subsection.
(3) No new construction area shall include slopes of greater than
15% slope, except for areas exempted by § 27-505,
Subsection4.
B. Option for a Tract That Includes Land in Both the CR District and
an Abutting R3 District With a Total Tract Area of 25 Acres or More.
(1) This option provides certain modifications to requirements
when a tract includes land in both the CR District and an
abutting R3 District and has a total area of all abutting lots in
common ownership within the tract of 25 acres of more, and if
the development proposes townhouses within the R3 portion of
the tract.
(2) See the R3 District regulations in §§ 27-306, 27-307 and
27-402, which allow various housing types, including
townhouses. If this option is utilized, the minimum net
buildable site area per townhouse in § 27-402 shall be reduced
to 6,000 square feet.
(3) A minimum of 75% of the total land area of the tract shall be
dedicated for permanent common open space purposes.
(4) No buildings shall be located within the CR District on land
greater than 25% slope, except for areas exempted by
§ 27-505, Subsection 4.
(5) Any permitted townhouses shall be set back a minimum of 100
feet from:
(a) The existing right-of-way of any arterial street; and
§ 27-310 SALISBURY CODE § 27-310
FWD:958
(b) The lot lines of any existing single-family detached
dwellings.
(6) Within a tract of land, the common open space may be
dedicated by the owner of record at the same time as or prior
to preliminary or final subdivision approval of the remaining
area for development, while the remaining area for
development may be sold to and developed by a different
owner or equitable owner.
(7) All dwellings shall be served by both public water and public
sewer service.
(8) The minimum tract area shall be 25 acres.
(9) Any townhouse or parking area for five or more vehicles that is
within 200 feet of and visible from a preexisting single-family
detached dwelling shall be separated from such preexisting
dwelling by a variety of evergreen and deciduous plants that
can reasonably be expected to form a solid visual screen within
five years from planting.
C. Land that was previously protected by a conservation easement
shall not be used to meet a requirement of this section.
D. Tract Area. For the purposes of this section, the term "total area of
the tract" shall mean the total lot area or the total lot area of
contiguous lots in common ownership, but not including areas
within the existing and future rights-of-way of existing streets, but
including the right-of-way of any new streets proposed within the
tract.
E. This open space option shall not apply to land within nonresidential
zoning districts.
F. Common open space used to meet the requirements of this
subsection shall meet all of the following requirements:
(1) Such land shall be dedicated to one of the following: the
County of Lehigh, Salisbury Township, a homeowners'
association, or an established nature conservation
organization acceptable to the Board of Commissioners. The
Township shall be given right of first refusal.
(2) The county, Township or such nature organization, as
applicable, shall agree in writing to accept such dedication and
maintain such land as open space open to the general public. If
no such entity agrees to accept such dedication, and if the
Township Board of Commissioners does not accept ownership
by a homeowners' association, such open space option shall
not be permitted.
§ 27-310 FOREWORD § 27-310
FWD:959
(3) Such open space shall be permanently deed-restricted to
noncommercial public recreational and open space uses,
except for lands permitted by this section to be used for
municipal uses.
(4) The applicant shall show that part of the required open space
would also meet all of the requirements for recreation land
under the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22].
(5) Stormwater detention basins shall not count towards this open
space, unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Board of Commissioners at the time of subdivision or land
development approval that such area would clearly serve a
recreation or scenic open space purpose.
(6) Such open space shall meet one of the following two
requirements:
(a) Have pedestrian access a minimum of 20 feet in width to a
public street or a private street to which the public is
permanently granted access and be a minimum of three
contiguous acres in area; or
(b) Directly abut an existing common open space area such
that the total abutting open space will be at least three
acres in area.
(7) Any homeowners' association agreement shall be subject to
review by the Township Solicitor to ensure it includes proper
procedures for maintenance of any land or facilities that are to
be owned or maintained by such entity. The Board of
Commissioners may require reasonable adjustments to such
agreement based upon such review. The provisions of Section
705(f)(1) and (2) of the Pennsylvania MPC, as amended, 53 P.S.
§ 10705(f), or such successor sections, shall serve as a general
guide for such agreement.

Part 4
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC USES
§ 27-401. Applicability.
§ 27-402. Additional Requirements for Specific Principal Uses.
1. This Part establishes additional specific requirements for certain
specific uses, in addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other
general requirements of this chapter and the requirements of each
district. Wherever two requirements conflict, the stricter requirement
shall apply.
2. For uses allowed within a specific zoning district as special exception or
conditional uses, see the procedures and general standards in §§ 27-119
and 27-120. These §§ 27-402 and 27-403 list a set of additional
standards to be used in determining whether a proposed special
exception or conditional use should be approved.
1. Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements
for that use:
A. ADULT USE. (This is limited to the following: adult store, adult
movie theater, massage parlor or adult live entertainment use).
(1) Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve
the following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of
this chapter:
(a) To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses
that affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of
the Township. These secondary impacts have been
documented in research conducted across the nation.
These secondary impacts typically include, but are not
limited to: increases in criminal activity, increases in
activities that increase the risk of transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases, increases in activities that increase
the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases,
increases in blight, decreases in the stability of residential
neighborhoods, and decreases in property values for
surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research
conducted across the nation concludes that adult uses
typically involve insufficient self-regulation to control

to establish deed restrictions or homeowners' association
regulations controlling the general types and materials of
attached decks, fences and accessory structures that may be
added or constructed in the future.
(9) Minimum Width of Townhouses. Each townhouse dwelling unit
shall have a minimum width of 18 feet, except the minimum

involving 25 or more dwelling units, a minimum of 10% of
the total land area shall be dedicated as common open
space. This common open space shall be in place of fees-inlieu-
of-open-space requirements of the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22]. Common open
spaces are encouraged to be used as a buffer against any
abutting major roads.

(2) The home occupation shall be conducted completely indoors
and may be within a principal or accessory residential building.
The total amount of floor area of all buildings used for a home
occupation shall not be greater than 20% of the total heated,

noise or glare in excess of what is typical in a residential
neighborhood.
(8) The use shall also comply with all environmental and nuisance
control regulations of this chapter, including Part 5.
(9) Parking and Loading. In any case, a home occupation shall
include an absolute minimum of one off-street parking space

The applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Hearing Board in the case of a general home occupation and
the Zoning Officer in the case of a light home occupation that
the use will include adequate off-street parking and loading
spaces. The amount of parking in the front yard should be held
to a minimum to maintain a residential character. Therefore,
the Township may allow appropriate, safe, on-street areas to be
used to meet a portion of parking needs. If additional parking
is needed beyond what can be accommodated using
appropriate on-street spaces and a residential-style driveway,
then the Township may require that such parking be provided
in the rear of the home if practical and may deny the use if
such rear parking cannot be accommodated.

shall not be changed in such a way as to decrease its
residential appearance, except for permitted parking spaces
and the permitted sign.

Part 5
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
§ 27-501. Performance Standards.
If the Zoning Officer has reason to believe that the proposed use may
have difficulty complying with the standards of this Part, then the Zoning
Officer may require an applicant to provide written descriptions of proposed
machinery, hazardous substances, operations and safeguards.
§ 27-502. Nuisances and Hazards to Public Safety.
§ 27-503. Wetlands, Seeps, Vernal Pools and Springs.
1. No landowner, tenant nor lessee shall use or allow to be used land or
structures in a way that seriously threatens to or creates any of the
following conditions:
A. Activities that encourage the breeding of disease-prone insects or
rodents.
B. Activity that creates a significant hazard to public health and safety
because of serious explosive, fire, biological, biogenetic or toxic
hazards. (See § 27-506, "Storage of Explosive and Hazardous
Substances.")
C. Activity that causes serious pollution to groundwaters or surface
waters.
2. See the provisions of the Property Maintenance Code regarding proper
maintenance of buildings.
3. Township Removal of Hazards. If the Zoning Officer becomes aware of a
serious threat to the public health and safety, the Zoning Officer may,
but is not required to, order the property owner to resolve the hazard. If
the hazard is not resolved within a reasonable specified period of time
after such notice, the Township may, at the option of the Board of
Commissioners, remove the hazard or contract for its removal. In such
case, the property owner shall be required to compensate the Township
for all such expenses for such work and any reasonable accompanying
legal and administrative costs. However, the Township does not take
responsibility for identifying or removing all hazards.
1. If the Zoning Officer or the Township Engineer has reason to believe
that a portion of a site proposed to be altered may meet the state or
federal definition of a wetland, the Zoning Officer may require the
applicant to provide an on-site study by a qualified professional
delineating the locations of wetlands. However, the Township accepts
no responsibility to identify all wetlands or to warn parties of such
possibilities. The presence of hydric soils, hydric vegetation typically
found in wetlands or other hydrological indicators may be indicators of
§ 27-501 FOREWORD § 27-503
FWD:1037
§ 27-504. Floodplain Areas; Setbacks from Surface Waterways; High
Water Table Soils.
an area needing more-detailed study. Sufficient information shall be
provided to the Township for a thorough review.
2. All permits of the Township are issued on the condition that the
applicant complies with federal and state wetlands regulations, and
such permits may be revoked or suspended by the Zoning Officer for
noncompliance with such regulations.
3. Seeps, Vernal Pools and Springs. In any area suspected of possibly
including a spring, vernal pools or seep, the applicant shall have field
research conducted on the property to identify and map any seeps or
springs.
4. Setbacks. A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be required between any
new principal building for which a building permit is issued after the
effective date of this chapter and any identified seep, vernal pool or
spring and any delineated "wetland." A minimum fifty-foot setback shall
also apply between the cartway of a proposed street and any seep,
vernal pool, spring or wetland.
1. Floodplains. All uses and structures shall comply with the Township
Floodplain Ordinance [Chapter 8] as a condition of this chapter.
A. A building shall not be constructed, placed or otherwise newly
located within the one-hundred-year floodplain. A swimming pool
that has sides that extend more than three feet above the ground
shall not be constructed, placed or otherwise located within the
one-hundred-year floodplain.
B. After requesting a review by the Township Engineer, the Zoning
Officer may require an applicant to perform a study of the extent of
the one-hundred-year floodplain along an alluvial soil area,
intermittent stream, channel or swale where the one-hundred-year
floodplain was not officially delineated previously. In areas
determined to be subject to a one-hundred-year flood, the same
Township regulations shall apply as if the area had been previously
officially delineated as being within the one-hundred-year
floodplain.
2. Purpose of Setbacks: to protect the water quality of surface waterways,
preserve physical access to surface waters in case of future public
acquisition, minimize erosion and sedimentation, preserve the natural
stormwater drainage system of the area, conserve sensitive wildlife and
aquatic habitats, preserve vegetation along waterways that will help
screen out eroded soil and other pollutants, and provide for setbacks
that can be used as required yard areas for a use.
3. Setbacks from Surface Waterways. No building, off-street parking or
commercial or industrial storage or display area shall be located within
§ 27-503 SALISBURY CODE § 27-504
FWD:1038
100 feet of the top edge of the primary bank of a major surface
waterway and 75 feet of the top edge of a minor surface waterway.
See the Township Floodplain Map in case a wider area is regulated
under the Floodplain Ordinance [Chapter 8]. The exact location of the
top edge of the primary bank shall be determined by the Township
Engineer. Major surface waters are defined as the Lehigh River. Minor
surface waters are defined as the Little Lehigh Creek, Trout Run Creek
and Cedar Creek.
4. Exemption. The setbacks of this section shall not apply to public utility
facilities or publicly owned recreational facilities.
5. Setback Areas and Construction. During any filling, grading or
construction activity, all reasonable efforts shall be made to leave the
setback areas of this section undisturbed, except at approved
approximately perpendicular crossings.
6. Vegetation. Within a setback required under Subsection 3, the applicant
shall describe natural vegetation and trees that will be removed or
replaced. Where trees and natural vegetation are removed within such
setback, the applicant shall plant new trees and other vegetation that
will serve the same or better environmental effect to avoid erosion and
to filter pollutants from runoff.
7. High Water Table Soils.
A. At the time of review of a proposed subdivision or land
development, the Zoning Officer may require that an on-site
investigation be conducted for the purpose of determining the
location of a high water table if any of the following conditions
exist:
(1) Soil mapping of the United States Natural Resources
Conservation Service or a more-reliable source indicates that
the area includes soils with a seasonal depth to water table of
less than three feet below the surface;
(2) Wetlands are present on the property; or
(3) There are other visual indicators of the presence of a high
water table.
B. The Township may require that test excavations be subject to
observation by a representative from the Township. The
determination of areas with high water table shall be made by a
qualified soil scientist or other professional who is acceptable to
the Township.
C. Areas that are to be permanently restricted against use for any
buildings or parking through an easement or deed restriction are
not required to be tested.
§ 27-504 FOREWORD § 27-504
FWD:1039
§ 27-505. Steep Slopes.
D. The lowest enclosed floor of a new principal building, including any
basement, shall be built a minimum of six inches above the
seasonal high water table elevation. Any new principal building
shall be constructed to limit the need for groundwater pumping.
1. Purposes. This section is intended to serve the following purposes, to
avoid problems that typically accompany development of steeply sloped
and adjacent areas:
A. To avoid severe soil erosion and sedimentation, especially
considering that most of the areas affected by this section have a
severe vulnerability to erosion based upon information provided by
the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service.
B. To avoid severely increased stormwater flows and speeds,
especially recognizing the existing severe stormwater problems
and overloaded sanitary sewer systems from stormwater
infiltration downhill from most of the areas affected by this section,
and especially recognizing the difficulty of regulating stormwater
control on small developments and single lot construction, and the
severe aggregate stormwater impact of numerous such small
developments.
C. To recognize the recommendations of the Lehigh Valley Planning
Commission's Comprehensive Plan for Lehigh and Northampton
Counties regarding natural feature conservation.
D. To steer development to those areas that are more physically suited
for it.
E. To avoid construction of steep roads that are difficult, timeconsuming
and expensive for maintenance and snow removal.
F. To avoid increased use of steep roads and driveways that are
dangerous to drive upon in snow and ice and in wet conditions.
G. To recognize that, although there are areas that are not steep
within the CR District, it usually is necessary to develop adjacent
steep areas in order to develop the nonsteep areas.
H. To seek to conserve forested areas that are an important part of the
ecological cycle, providing for groundwater recharge, air pollution
reduction and wildlife habitats.
I. To recognize that many of the areas affected by this section include
natural springs, wetlands and major drainage channels that are
very important parts of the hydrological cycle, to protect water
quality, water quantity, aquatic habitats and public water supplies
(including the Little Lehigh Creek and Allentown's Crystal Spring).
§ 27-504 SALISBURY CODE § 27-505
FWD:1040
J. To allow each property owner a reasonable use of their land,
related directly to the natural features and location and
accessibility of the land.
K. To recognize that the Township has allowed and continues to allow
and direct a reasonable amount of intense growth in more
physically suitable portions of the Township. This especially
includes areas where public sewer service is efficiently available,
thereby using less total land to accommodate the same number of
dwelling units than if such development occurred in areas without
public water service.
L. To base the permitted intensity of development upon the physical
characteristics of a parcel to support development, especially the
steepness of slopes.
M. To recognize that development of many of the less-steep areas
affected by this section would require increased use of existing
steep roads that are not suitable for intense traffic because of
slope, limited sight distance, horizontal and vertical alignment
problems and limited width, and that it would be difficult to
improve these roads to an acceptable level because of the cost,
presence of wetlands, limited right-of-way and steep slopes.
N. To recognize that many of the areas affected by this section are
difficult to efficiently serve with community facilities and services
because of distances involved, steepness of roads and
inaccessibility, including the following services: fire truck access,
emergency medical response, police response, active recreation
facilities, school busing, street maintenance, snow plowing and
public water supply.
O. To recognize that most of the areas affected by this section are not
served by a public water system; this limits amounts of water
available for firefighting.
P. To minimize the necessity for state, municipal and private
expenditures to correct soil erosion, subsidence and sedimentation
problems.
Q. To recognize that the Trout Creek and Little Lehigh Creek already
suffer from severe silting problems after heavy rains.
R. To recognize that the open space option in § 27-310 provides an
opportunity for economical development of a tract by clustering the
units on the less-steep areas, thereby lowering construction,
grading, road and improvement costs.
S. To recognize that central sewage service is not expected to be
available in the majority of the CR District, and that on-lot septic
systems frequently have a higher rate of failure on steep areas than
less-steep areas.
§ 27-505 FOREWORD § 27-505
FWD:1041
2. Definition of "Construction Area." For the purposes of this section,
"construction area" shall mean the total land areas proposed to be used
for and/or within any and all of the following:
A. Areas within the proposed lot that are within 15 feet of any or all of
the following existing or proposed features:
(1) Principal buildings or principal structures (other than the
required rear yard in Subsection 2C below).
(2) Accessory structures or uses existing or proposed at the time
of development of the principal building or structure.
(3) An accessory building of more than 500 square feet of building
coverage.
B. Areas within the proposed lot that are within 10 feet of any existing
or proposed gravel or paved areas (including driveways) serving
nonresidential uses, other than walkways.
C. Areas within the proposed lot that are within 40 feet of the rear of a
principal building.
D. Areas within a directly abutting portion of a proposed public or
private street, from the center line inward to the closest lot line of
the abutting lot.
E. Gravel or paved areas (including driveways) serving residential
uses other than walkways.
F. Areas proposed to be graded.
3. Slope of Construction Area. The "slope of the construction area" shall
be defined as the highest slope that is present within the construction
area prior to disturbance. See the exceptions subsection of this section.
The contours of land regulated by this section shall not be altered prior
to documentation, submission and regulation under this section. The
slope shall be based upon two-foot or five-foot contours within areas
proposed to be disturbed, unless the Township Engineer preapproves a
different contour interval.
4. Exceptions to Slope Requirements.
A. Small Areas of Slope.
(1) If the areas of over 8% slope within the construction area total
less than 400 square feet, that by itself shall not cause the
requirements related to over 8% slope to apply.
(2) If the areas of over 12% slope within the construction area
total less than 400 square feet, that by itself shall not cause the
requirements related to over 12% slope to apply.
§ 27-505 SALISBURY CODE § 27-505
FWD:1042
(3) If the areas of over 15% slope within the construction area
total less than 400 square feet, that by itself shall not cause the
requirements related to over 15% slope to apply.
(4) If the areas of over 25% slope within the construction area
total less than 400 square feet, that by itself shall not cause the
requirements related to over 25% slope to apply.
B. Existing Roads. The disturbance of sloped areas for widening,
alignment, improvement or sight distance improvement of an
existing street for public safety reasons or that is required by,
approved by or accomplished by the Township or PennDOT shall
not by itself cause the requirements of this section to apply.
C. Accessory Structures. The construction or placement of a
customary accessory structure or use of up to 600 square feet of
building coverage on a lot after the issuance of the original
occupancy permit for a principal building or structure shall not by
itself cause the requirements of this section to apply, provided that
no earthmoving shall occur on areas of over 25% slope.
D. Man-Made Slopes. The alteration of slopes that were clearly
lawfully man-made (such as walls of a detention basin or quarry or
excavated banks along a street) shall be regulated by a reasonable
estimate of the natural slope of such land and not by the degree of
such man-made slope.
E. Building Expansion. The expansion of the building coverage of an
existing permitted residential building up to 50% beyond the total
building coverage that existed at the time of adoption of this
section shall not by itself cause the requirements of this section to
apply. This 50% maximum shall apply to the cumulative total of all
expansions over the life of the building. This exemption shall only
apply if there is no earthmoving on areas with a natural slope of
over 25% slope.
F. Recreation. The development of noncommercial open space
recreation uses by a governmental agency or an established nature
conservation organization, including, but not limited to, parking to
serve common open space or the development of public
recreational facilities, shall not by itself cause the requirements of
this section to apply.
5. Lot Area in CR or Without Public Sewer Service. The following shall
apply: in the CR Zoning District; or in other zoning districts when the
dwelling or principal uses will not be served by public sewer service.
Whichever of the following is most restrictive shall apply:
§ 27-505 FOREWORD § 27-505
FWD:1043
If the maximum slope within
the construction site area is: The minimum lot area shall be:
8% or less 2 acres
Over 8% and up to 12% 2.5 acres
Over 12% and up to 15% 4 acres
Over 15% and up to 25% 5 acres
Over 25% Earthmoving prohibited except as
permitted by special exception by
this section
6. Sloped Areas with Sewage Service. The following, whichever is most
restrictive, shall apply for dwellings or principal uses using public
sewer service in districts other than the CR District:
If the maximum slope of the
construction area is: The minimum lot area shall be:
15% or less No additional requirements under
this subsection
Over 15% and up to 25% 2 acres with a minimum lot width
of 125 feet
Over 25% Earthmoving prohibited except as
permitted by special exception by
this section
7. Earthmoving on Slopes. No earthmoving activities shall occur within
areas of a construction area or in preparation for or related to
construction or development, on slopes of over 25% in any zoning
district, except:
A. As provided for by the exceptions subsection of this section; and
B. If the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing
Board under the special exception procedures that all of the
following conditions would be met:
(1) That disturbance of such slopes is necessary to allow
development of a single permitted principal use or single
principal building on an undeveloped existing lot of record of at
least six acres. This shall not permit disturbance of slopes of
greater than 25% for expansion of an existing use or building.
(2) That slopes of over 30% will not be altered or disturbed.
(3) That there are no areas of less than 25% slope on the lot that
are reasonably physically suitable for the construction area.
8. Increase of Slope.
§ 27-505 SALISBURY CODE § 27-505
FWD:1044
A. If more than 5,000 square feet of land area is increased in slope so
that the average resulting slope is greater than 15% and more than
6% above the pre-existing slope, the applicant must prove to the
satisfaction of the Township Engineer that stormwater will be
adequately managed to prevent increased flooding or erosion to
other properties.
B. The maximum slope resulting from excavation or earth fill shall be
three feet horizontal to one-foot vertical, unless the applicant
provides professional engineering certification acceptable to the
Township Engineer that the finished slopes will be safe and stable.

standards" part of the Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance [Chapter 22].
10. Erosion Control. If slopes of greater than 15% are to be disturbed, the
applicant shall submit to the Township and carry out an acceptable
sedimentation and erosion control plan. The Township may then require
that such plan be submitted to and found acceptable by the County
Conservation District. There shall be compliance with all state
sedimentation and erosion control regulations that are in effect at the
time of the approval of the erosion and sedimentation control plan, and
compliance with such regulations shall be a condition of all permits
issued under this chapter.
11. Slope Submittal Requirements. Applicants proposing uses affected by
this section shall provide the following information to the Township as
part of preliminary subdivision or land development plans or on a
separate site plan where a SALDO plan is not required. Such
designated construction area shall be binding upon future owners of
each lot, unless such applicant provides a revised site plan that proves
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a revised construction area
location would not cause a larger lot area to be required and would
meet all other requirements of this chapter.
A. Mapping of slopes, with identification of the following intervals:
(1) Eight percent or less.
(2) Over 8% and up to 12%.
(3) Over 12% and up to 15%.

debris is left in an unsightly fashion nor in a fashion that interferes with
drainage, streets or utilities.
4. Fill. Materials used for fill as a future base for construction shall be
nonbiodegradable, well-compacted and provide a suitable and secure
base. The Zoning Officer, upon the advice of the Township Engineer,
may require that an applicant fund appropriate underground testing of
a proposed building site if there is reasonable doubt, in the opinion of
the Township Engineer, that the subsurface is suitable and secure for
the proposed use.
5. Dumping. Outdoor dumping of junk or solid waste in other than an
approved solid waste disposal facility, composting facility or junkyard is
prohibited.
1. Placement. Whenever reasonable, commercial, industrial and
institutional outdoor machinery that could create a noise nuisance shall

§ 27-515. Stripping of Topsoil.
The permanent stripping and removal of more than 50% of the topsoil from
any lot is prohibited, except on portions of a lot for which approval has been
received to construct a building or paving. This section shall not restrict
the temporary stockpiling of topsoil during construction, nor routine crop
farming practices. This 50% restriction shall apply to any individual action,
as well as to the total removal of topsoil from the lot over any length of time
(such as 25% one year, and 25% the next year).
§ 27-516. Tree Harvesting, Woodland Preservation, and Cutting of
Trees (includes but is not limited to "forestry" as defined by the
MPC).
applicant proves in writing to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that
such fencing or walls are not needed:
A. Outdoor industrial storage areas involving storage covering more
than 5,000 square feet of land.
B. Stationary hazardous machinery and equipment that are outdoors.
C. Outdoor bulk aboveground or surface storage of potentially
explosive or hazardous liquids, gases or substances.
1. No use shall routinely cause electrical, radio or electromagnetic
disturbances to equipment on other lots, except for overhead electric
lines that comply with Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
standards.
2. No radioactive wastes shall be disposed of in any district, and no
radioactive wastes shall be stored on a lot for longer than 90 days after
their active use is completed. See also Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection regulations.
1. Purpose. The presence of living trees in our surroundings is important
and desirable from an ecological, environmental and aesthetic
standpoint, to manage stormwater runoff and minimize flooding, to
protect water quality, improve air quality, and to control erosion. Trees
also help to regenerate groundwater supplies. Tree harvesting is
allowed but should be regulated to ensure that environmental, forest
management and aesthetic goals are realized.
2. Except as otherwise herein provided, it shall be unlawful for any person
to cut down any tree in any zone in Salisbury Township which is six
inches or more in diameter. For the purposes of this § 27-516, diameter
shall be measured at a point 4 1/2 feet above the surrounding ground
level prior to any earth disturbance.
§ 27-513 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:1051
3. It shall be lawful as a by-right use in any calendar year for a person to
cut down, on each lot, a maximum of three trees of six inches or more in
diameter. If a lot includes more than one acre of forested land, then in
any calendar year, up to three trees of six inches' or more diameter may
be cut per forested acre. In addition, trees may be cut as provided in
§ 27-516, Subsection 4, or within an approved tree harvesting
operation, or as provided below within a construction site.
4. Cutting of Trees. It shall be lawful to cut down such trees six inches or
more in diameter only if:
A. The tree is significantly diseased, infested with carpenter ants or a
similar destructive pest, damaged beyond recovery, or is dead. See
Subsection 5 below.
B. The tree is in such position or condition that it constitutes a danger
to neighboring property, the property on which it is located, to
public utility lines or to the public generally.
C. The tree is located within an area that needs to be regraded and/or
paved for a proposed street or curbing or sidewalk or utility, or is
within five feet of the existing or proposed cartway of an uncurbed
street.
D. The tree meets the standards of § 27-516, Subsection 6, "Cutting
Trees Prior to Construction."
E. In case of emergency, the tree is removed within the following
procedures:
(1) No more than one such tree shall be cut down unless and until
a permit to do so has been obtained from the Zoning Officer.
(2) In an emergency where time does not allow the prior obtaining
of such permit, a permit shall be applied for within 72 hours
after the cutting down of any tree.
F. This § 27-516 shall not regulate removal of invasive, poisonous or
noxious species of vegetation. The Zoning Officer may approve the
replacement of existing nonnative trees or other trees that the
applicant shows to have low environmental value with newly
planted trees with a higher environmental value.
5. Damaged and Diseased Trees. In nonemergency cases, unless
otherwise stipulated by the Zoning Officer, site evaluations to
determine or identify significantly diseased, infected, damaged or dead
trees shall be made during a particular tree's growth period of the year;
evaluations shall not be made while trees are in their dormant state.
Trees so evaluated and marked during growth periods may
subsequently be cut during dormant periods with the approval of the
Zoning Officer.
6. Cutting Trees Prior to Construction.
§ 27-516 SALISBURY CODE § 27-516
FWD:1052
A. When a zoning permit is issued for a building, structure or use, it
shall be lawful to cut down any trees which exist in the space to be
occupied by such building, structure or use, any space within 15
feet of any such building or structure, any space to be occupied by,
and all space within 10 feet of, all sides of any driveway, parking
areas, water system or sewage disposal system, utilities, basins,
berms or other areas of earthwork, including areas for erosion and
sedimentation control or post-construction stormwater
management.
B. In such case, the construction area of all buildings or structures,
driveways, parking areas, water systems and sewage disposal
systems shall be properly surveyed and staked, and no such trees
shall be cut down until the Zoning Officer has issued a permit for
the marked trees to be cut down in such a manner that it can be
determined after the cutting that only those trees for which the
permit was issued have been cut down.
C. If trees are cut down as stated in Subsection 6B above, either the
permitted construction or the replanting of the same density of
trees must be completed within four years of the issuance date of
the permit.
7. Killing or Damaging of Trees.
A. During the construction or installation of any structure, driveways,
parking area, water systems or sewage disposal systems, or in the
process of landscaping or grading the lot, the fill generated by such
construction, installation, landscaping or grading shall not be
temporarily placed or stored in a manner which, as determined by
the Zoning Officer, will potentially kill or seriously damage trees on
the tract of land.
B. It shall be unlawful to purposefully kill a tree by artificial means,
including, but not limited to, girdling, smothering or the
application of poisonous chemicals.
C. Temporary fencing shall be required by the Township to be placed
by the applicant in an area five feet beyond the dripline of any trees
intended to be preserved, during activities that may result in
damage to the trees or compaction of the root system. Vehicles
shall not drive under the dripline and materials shall not be stored
under the dripline during construction or tree harvesting
operations.
8. Tree Harvesting. Tree harvesting shall be permitted in all zones
indicated in accordance with the provisions of § 27-306, and all other
provisions of this chapter.
A. Plan Required. Tree harvesting shall be done only in accordance
with a forest management plan prepared by a forester with a
degree from a program accredited by the Society of American
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:1053
Foresters and after a permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer.
A copy of such plan shall be filed with the Zoning Officer along with
a permit application at least 30 days prior to the proposed start
date of such tree harvesting. Before such a permit is issued, the
Zoning Officer shall have had the plan reviewed by a forester with
a degree from a program accredited by the Society of American
Foresters. If the Zoning Officer deems it necessary, the plan shall
be submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources to request their review.
B. All forest management plans, and the tree harvesting operation
itself, shall comply with the following requirements:
(1) All tree harvesting methods shall be by an accepted
silvicultural method. Clear-cutting is prohibited. "Clearcutting"
shall mean any procedure by which 70% or more of
the merchantable timber is cut on any acre. A minimum of 30%
of trees of six inches' or greater trunk diameter shall remain
and shall be distributed across each acre, and such remaining
trees shall include some trees of higher-value species.
(2) A listing shall be provided of current stocking levels, species
composition and tree quality and condition, as well as a
descriptive narrative of the subject property. In addition,
estimates must be provided as to the type and quantity of
timber to be harvested and what the residual stocking levels
should be. Where it appears that timber harvesting operations
will result in lower or understocked stand density levels,
justifications for such a harvesting must be included.
(3) Reforestation. The plan shall identify the reforestation
process(es) to be employed and specifically identify, with
respect to each principal variety of tree to be reforested, the
method or methods of reforestation to be employed, and the
recommended reforestation period shall be deemed to be an
essential part of any forest management plan and, as such, will
be deemed to be a continuing use until said period is
completed. No other use may occur on the site until the
reforestation period is complete, with the sole exception of the
maintenance or construction of a single-family residential
dwelling.
(4) Harvesting Operations.
(a) Multiple-lot tree harvesting is not allowed on lots which
have been subdivided within five years of the submission
date of a tree harvesting permit or application.
(b) Before a permit is issued to conduct a tree harvesting
operation as part of a forest management plan, the
applicant/owner(s) shall submit to the Zoning Officer and
the Township Solicitor, fully executed and acknowledged
§ 27-516 SALISBURY CODE § 27-516
FWD:1054
in duly recordable form, a restrictive covenant (along with
a deposit for the cost of recording said restrictive covenant
and required attachments in the county office for the
recording of such instruments) wherein the landowner(s)
acknowledge(s), covenant(s) and agree(s), on behalf of
himself, herself or themselves and his/her/their respective
heirs, assigns, grantees, vendees and successors, that:
1) All tree harvesting operations will be conducted only
in accordance with this Part and the approved forest
management plan. Such plan that was accepted by the
Township shall be binding upon the applicant unless a
revised plan that complies with this chapter is
accepted by the Township.
2) As soon as practical and consistent with sound forest
management practices, after the conclusion of the
tree harvesting operation, the applicant(s)/owner(s)
shall cause to be implemented the reforestation
portion of the approved forest management plan.
3) Until the completion of the reforestation portion of the
forest management plan, including the reforestation
period set forth therein, the tract(s) or parcel(s) of
land which was/were the subject of the tree harvesting
operation shall be put to no other use except the
maintenance or construction of a single-family
dwelling, including, but not limited to, any use which
would otherwise be a permitted use for said land in
the zoning district in question.
4) In the event an unexpected or evasive or harmful
situation arises which threatens the reforestation,
then limited management activities may be allowed
with the approval of the Zoning Officer.
(c) An erosion and sedimentation control plan designed to
prevent erosion and sedimentation during and after the
tree harvesting operation shall be submitted at the same
time the forest management plan is filed. The Zoning
Officer may require that the plan also be submitted to the
County Conservation District and that the applicant pay
the district for the costs of any review they wish to
provide.
(d) If the tree harvesting involves 10 or more acres of land, a
property boundary survey shall be required to be
submitted to the Township, and the boundaries of the
property shall be marked in the field during tree
harvesting operations.
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:1055
(e) The landowner and operator shall be jointly responsible to
ensure compliance with this section. The Zoning Officer
may issue a stop-work order if there is not compliance with
this section.
(5) Tree Harvesting Operations.
(a) All cutting, removing, skidding, and transportation of trees
shall be planned and performed in such a manner as to
minimize the disturbance of or damage to other trees and
vegetation and the land itself.
(b) Roads and trails shall be constructed, maintained and
abandoned in such a manner as to prevent soil erosion and
permanent damage to soil and waterways.
(c) Roads and trails shall be only wide enough to
accommodate the type of equipment used, and grades
shall be kept as low as possible.
(d) A crossing of any waterway shall be avoided, unless no
alternative exists. Where a waterway crossing is
necessary, the number of crossings shall be minimized.
Any crossing shall be made at a right angle across suitable
culverts or bridges or other approved surfaces for
crossing, and all state and federal permits shall be
obtained where required.
(e) Skidding across live or intermittent streams is prohibited,
except over bridges or culverts.
(f) All limbs and stubs shall be removed from felled trees prior
to skidding.
(g) All trees bent or held down by felled trees shall be released
promptly.
(h) No trees shall be left lodged in the processes of falling.
(i) Felling or skidding on or across the property of others is
prohibited without the express written consent of the
owners of such property. Felling or skidding on or across
any public street is prohibited without the express written
consent of the Township in the case of Township streets or
PennDOT in the case of state highways.
(j) No tops or slash shall be left within:
1) Fifty feet of any public street or adjoining property;
2) Seventy-five feet of any waterway or historic or scenic
trail; or
3) Ten feet of any drainage ditch.
§ 27-516 SALISBURY CODE § 27-516
FWD:1056
(k) The stumps of all felled trees shall remain in the soil for
stabilization purposes, unless the site is actively planned
for development or replanting. The stumps shall not be
higher than two feet above ground level.
(l) Wild grapevines may be cut or removed, but only to the
extent that such cutting or removal does not qualitatively
affect wildlife food supply.
(m) Slash piles shall not be higher than four feet.
(n) Any damage to a public street that occurs as a result of the
timbering operation shall be repaired and/or funded by the
entity completing the timbering.
(o) Timbering shall not occur between the hours of 8:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m.
(6) Buffer Zones. See definition in Part 2. Tree harvesting shall not
occur within 75 feet from street rights-of-way and abutting lot
lines that are not in common ownership. Tree harvesting shall
not occur within 100 feet from the top of the primary bank of
any perennial rivers, creeks or other watercourses.
(7) All practical actions shall be accomplished to prevent damage
or injury to young growth and trees not designated for cutting.
(8) Fire Hazards. During periods of abnormal forest fire danger, as
determined by the Fire Chiefs Association of Salisbury
Township, the Township shall have the right to order a
suspension of tree harvesting operations until the danger
subsides.
(9) Littering is prohibited; and during and upon completion of a
tree harvesting operation, all cans, bottles, paper, garbage,
and other litter of any type shall be removed from the property.
(10) Upon completion of a tree harvesting operation, all roads shall
be graded to eliminate any wheel ruts. With the exception of
easements, access to all such roads from any public street by
motor vehicles of any kind shall be effectively blocked, by such
means as the building of a mound or the installation of a gate;
no cables shall be used for this purpose. As deemed necessary
by the Zoning Officer, haul roads and landing areas must be
stabilized and seeded.
(11) Tree harvesting shall not occur within wetlands.
C. Marking of Trees. Before the tree harvesting operation begins, all
trees which are to be felled in connection therewith shall be clearly
marked on the trunk 4 1/2 feet above the ground and marked
numerically with either paint or tags on the stump so that the same
may be easily identified both before and after a tree has been
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:1057
felled. In addition, a tally of all marked trees and, if necessary as
determined by the Zoning Officer, a sketch of the affected area will
be required. No tree shall be felled which has not been designated
for removal on the forest management plan as finally approved by
the Zoning Hearing Board.
D. Notification of Beginning, Suspension or Completion of Tree
Harvesting.
(1) The holder of a permit to conduct a tree harvesting operation
shall notify the Township at least 48 hours before the cutting of
trees is to begin in connection with the construction of roads or
trails.
(2) The holder of a permit to conduct a tree harvesting operation
shall notify the Township at least 48 hours before the cutting of
trees for removal from the site is to begin.
(3) The holder of a permit to conduct a tree harvesting operation
shall notify the Township at least 48 hours in advance of the
expected suspension of the tree harvesting operation for more
than five successive working days for reasons other than
weather conditions.
(4) The holder of a permit to conduct a tree harvesting operation
shall notify the Township at least one week in advance of the
completion date of the tree harvesting operation and shall
notify the Township immediately upon said operation's
completion.
(5) The applicant for a tree harvesting permit shall mail, deliver or
provide written notice to the last-known owner of record of all
abutting lots that the application has been submitted, within
five calendar days after such submittal. Such owners shall also
be given at least 48 hours' advance written notice of when the
initial tree harvesting will begin.
E. Insurance. The holder of a permit to conduct a tree harvesting
operation shall secure appropriate and acceptable levels of liability
and workers' compensation insurance for all employees working in
the tree harvesting operation.
F. Township Inspections.
(1) The Township may, by its own personnel or outside persons
hired for the purpose, go upon the site of any proposed tree
harvesting operation after an application to conduct such
operation has been filed for the purpose of reviewing the plans
for the proposed operation and thereafter recommending or
opposing the proposed operation or recommending or
requiring changes or modifications thereto.
§ 27-516 SALISBURY CODE § 27-516
FWD:1058
(2) After a permit for a tree harvesting operation has been issued,
the Township shall have the right, by its own personnel or by
outside persons hired for the purpose, to go upon the site
before, during and after the tree harvesting operation to
ensure and require compliance with the plans for said
operation as finally approved and all of the terms and
provisions of this chapter.
9. Tree Cutting Enforcement. If trees are cut, harvested or killed in
violation of any of the provisions of this section, or are wantonly or
negligently injured, a fine shall be levied not in excess of $500 per tree
so affected, plus all court costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred by the Township, in addition to a requirement to replant a new
tree of three inches' minimum caliper for each tree that was removed
without approval.
10. Woodland Protection.
A. Applicability. The additional regulations in this section shall apply
to tree cutting (other than approved "timber harvesting") when a
lot or tract includes 20,000 square feet or more of woodland which
is proposed to be disturbed, based upon the land area of an existing
lot before any subdivision.
B. Disturbance Limits. Clear-cutting of any woodland area shall be
prohibited except to the minimum extent necessary to permit the
implementation of an approved land development or building
permit in conformance with this section. All woodland disturbance
shall be subject to both maximum disturbance limitations and
disturbance thresholds, beyond which woodland replacement shall
be required, as set forth herein.
C. Measurement of Woodland Disturbance. Disturbance limitations
shall be measured based on the extent of the woodland at the time
of the effective date of this chapter and shall be indicated on
applicable plan(s). The extent of any area of woodland disturbance
shall be measured to include the entire area within the dripline of
any tree where any part of the area within the dripline of said tree
is subject to woodland disturbance. Any disturbance limitation
shall run with the land, once established. Subsequent applications
shall be subject to the initial determination of disturbance
limitations and thresholds set forth in this section, regardless of
intervening disturbance which may have occurred.
D. Maximum Disturbance Limits. Permitted woodland disturbance for
any purpose (other than timber harvesting) on any lot or tract shall
not exceed 30% of the total woodland areas on a lot. If a lot is
proposed to be subdivided, the regulation shall apply to all of the
total woodland areas prior to subdivision. Tree removal within the
Hospital Overlay Zone referenced in Part 10 shall be in accordance
with the approved and coordinated open land plan.
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:1059
§ 27-517. Maximum Slope and Width of Driveways.
E. Protection During Construction. In areas of woodland disturbance
and immediately adjacent areas, remaining trees shall be protected
from damage using the following procedures during construction:
(1) Where existing trees are to remain, no change in existing
grade shall be permitted within the dripline of the trees.
Appropriate fencing four feet in height shall be placed at the
dripline of trees to remain, wherever adjacent to proposed
construction. Such fencing shall be maintained in place
throughout the duration of construction activity. Roots shall
not be cut within the dripline of any trees to remain.
(2) Trees within 25 feet of a building, or bordering entrances or
exits to building sites, shall be protected by a temporary
barrier to be maintained in place throughout the duration of
construction activity.
(3) No boards or other material shall be nailed or otherwise
attached to trees during construction.
(4) Construction materials, equipment, soil and/or debris shall not
be stored nor disposed of within the driplines of trees to
remain.
(5) Tree trunks, limbs, and exposed roots damaged during
construction shall be protected from further damage by being
treated immediately in accordance with accepted professional
landscape procedures.
(6) Trees which die during or within 24 months after completion of
construction because of failure to adhere to this section shall
be replaced by a new tree of a similar species within nine
months afterwards.
1. No portion of a driveway or accessway other than a street shall have a
maximum finished slope greater than 15%. No driveway shall be
developed that does not have sufficient leveling area as it enters into a
street, as determined by the Zoning Officer, upon the advice of the
Township Engineer.
2. See also the regulations of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance [Chapter 22] governing slope of driveways at approaches to
streets.
3. The Zoning Hearing Board, by special exception, may allow a driveway
or accessway other than a street to have a slope greater than 15% but
less than 20% if the applicant proves one of the following to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board:
§ 27-516 SALISBURY CODE § 27-517
FWD:1060
§ 27-518. Clearance Height of Tree Limbs.
For any tree within or extending within the existing right-of-way of a public
street, the owner of such tree (or the abutting property if such tree is within
the right-of-way) shall keep the limbs of such tree trimmed so that the
growth does not obstruct light from any streetlight and so that there shall
be a clear minimum height of 10 feet above the cartway of a street and eight
feet above a sidewalk.
§ 27-519. Groundwater or Springwater Withdrawal.
A. That there is no reasonably physically suitable alternative for the
development of an existing lot; or
B. That the development of a driveway with less than 15% slope would
unavoidably result in a substantially more-extensive and moresevere
total disturbance of slopes over 15% than if a steeper
driveway would be permitted.
4. No driveway of greater than 100 feet in length in a CR District that was
approved to serve a dwelling unit shall have a paved or stoned width of
greater than 15 feet for more than 50 feet.
1. This § 27-519 shall regulate new or increased groundwater or spring
water withdrawals averaging more than 10,000 gallons per day from a
lot for off-site consumption.
2. The regulations of this § 27-519 shall not apply to any of the following:
A. Water used by a principal agricultural use within the Township or
to on-site consumption; or
B. Water is being utilized for uses on adjacent lots or as part of a
public water system.
3. If the water will be trucked off site, the applicant shall provide a written
report by a professional engineer with substantial experience in traffic
engineering. Such study shall analyze the suitability of the area street
system to accommodate the truck traffic that will be generated.
4. If the water will be trucked off site, any area used for loading or
unloading of tractor-trailer trucks shall be set back a minimum of 150
feet from any adjacent residential lot.
5. Any bottling or processing operations shall be considered a distinct use
and shall only be allowed if "food or beverage manufacturing" is an
allowed use under § 27-306.
6. Any zoning permit is conditioned upon receiving approval, as
applicable, from the Delaware River Basin Commission.

Part 6
OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 27-601. Required Number of Parking Spaces.
1. Overall Requirements.
A. Number of Spaces. Each use that is newly developed, enlarged,
significantly changed in type or increased in number of
establishments shall provide and maintain off-street parking spaces
in accordance with Table 6.1 and the regulations of this Part.
B. Uses Not Listed. Uses not specifically listed in Table 6.1 shall
comply with the requirements for the most similar use listed in
Table 6.1, unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Officer that an alternative standard should be used for that
use.
C. Multiple Uses. Where a proposed lot contains or includes more
than one type of use, the number of parking spaces required shall
be the sum of the parking requirements for each separate use,
except as may be allowed under § 27-601, Subsection 2.
D. Calculation. Where the calculation of required parking spaces does
not result in a whole number, the calculation shall be rounded to
the closest whole number.
2. Reduction of Parking Requirements by Conditional Use.
A. Purposes: to minimize impervious surfaces, while ensuring
adequate parking; to recognize unique circumstances may justify a
reduction in parking.
B. The Board of Commissioners may permit a reduction, through the
conditional use process of § 27-119, of the number of parking
spaces required to be developed if the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Board that fewer parking spaces are needed.
(1) Proof. To prove that fewer parking spaces are needed, the
applicant shall provide existing and projected employment,
customer, resident or other relevant data. Such data may
include a study of parking at similar developments during peak
periods of use.
(2) Shared Parking. Under this section, an applicant may seek to
prove that parking permanently shared with another use or
another lot with shared internal access will reduce the total
amount of parking needed because the uses have different
peak times of parking need or overlapping customers.
(3) Reservation of Future Parking Areas. If a reduction is
permitted under this section, the Board of Commissioners may
§ 27-601 FOREWORD § 27-601
FWD:1063
require as a condition of the conditional use that the lot include
the reservation, permanently or for a specified number of
years, of areas for use if needed in the future for additional
parking.
(a) Such reservation shall be provided in a legal form
acceptable to the Board of Commissioners' Solicitor. A
legally binding deed restriction is recommended.
(b) In such case, the applicant shall be required to submit site
plans to the Zoning Officer showing where and how the
additional parking could be accomplished. Such future
parking areas shall be designed to meet all Township
requirements, including stormwater runoff. Such future
parking areas shall not be covered by buildings and shall
be attractively landscaped unless needed for parking.
(c) Such additional parking shall be required to be provided
within one year by the owner of the lot at that time after
the Zoning Officer may determine in writing to such owner
that such parking has become needed to meet actual use.
Such determination shall be based upon the Zoning
Officer's on-site review on at least three different days.

1. General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to result in
safe and orderly use and to fully take into account all of the following:
vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement within the
site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drive-through facilities.
No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to traffic off
the lot.
2. Existing Parking. Structures and uses in existence at the effective date
of this chapter shall not be required to add additional parking spaces to
meet the requirements of this Part unless: (A) the general type of use is
significantly changed; or (B) the use is expanded a total aggregate over
time of more than 5% or 2,000 square feet in floor area, whichever is
more restrictive. Any parking spaces serving such preexisting
structures or uses at the time of adoption of this chapter shall not in the
future be reduced in number below the number required by this
chapter.
3. Change in Use or Expansion. If a building or use: (A) significantly
changes in type of principal use or expands by a measure used in this
Part to determine parking need (such as floor area, maximum number
of employees, number of dwellings units or seating capacity); and (B) if
such expansion or change would increase the number of required
parking spaces by at least 10% or 20 spaces, whichever is less, then the
use shall provide the total number of parking spaces that would be
required if the entire existing and proposed uses would be newly
developed under this Part, instead of only being required to provide the
additional spaces for the change or expansion.
4. Continuing Obligation of Parking and Loading Spaces. All required
numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be
§ 27-601 FOREWORD § 27-602

available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve still
exists, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the
minimum required by this chapter. No required parking area or offstreet
loading spaces shall be used for any other use (such as storage
or display of materials) that interferes with the area's availability for
parking to serve a use.
5. Location of Parking. Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the
same lot or abutting lot with the principal use served, unless the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a
permanent method of providing the spaces is available using area of a
lot within 250 feet of the entrance of the principal use being served.
6. Bicycle Rack. If a lot is required to provide 15 or more parking spaces,
and if the owner provides a suitable bicycle rack that can be used to
secure three or more bicycles, then one fewer off-street parking space
shall be required. The bicycle rack shall be located where it will be
visible to and convenient for customers or employees but where it will
not interfere with access for pedestrians or persons with disabilities or
emergency access.

types of signs in § 27-711.120
2. Maximum Height of Wall Signs. The top part of a wall sign shall not be
placed at a maximum height greater than the total height of the
building to which it is attached, up to a maximum height of 35 feet,
whichever is more restrictive.
3. Special Sale Displays. These displays shall include promotional
banners, balloons, floodlights, lasers or flags (other than provided for in
§ 27-703) that are used by a business to attract special attention. Such
displays may be placed on a commercially zoned lot, for a maximum
total of 21 days for each permit. The permit fee will be equal to the
current fee for commercial zoning permits. A minimum of 90 days shall
elapse between uses of such displays. Such displays shall only be
allowed on lots including a principal commercial use. [Amended by
Ord. 12-2016-608, 12/8/2016]
4. Signs on Mobile Stands.
A. Purpose. These standards recognize signs on mobile stands as a
particular type of sign that has the characteristics of a temporary
sign but that has been inappropriately used as a permanent sign.
This section is based on the policy that if a use desires to regularly
display a sign for regularly changing messages, that it erect a
permanent sign within all of the requirements of this chapter.
B. Definition of a "Sign on a Mobile Stand": a freestanding sign that is
not permanently attached to the ground or permanently attached
to a building and that can be carried on the back of a flatbed truck
or towed from one location to another.
C. A temporary sign on a mobile stand, including any such sign that
may have been displayed prior to the adoption of this chapter and
which does not have a lawful permit as a permanent sign, shall only
be permitted if it meets all of the following requirements:
[Amended by Ord. 12-2016-608, 12/8/2016]
(1) Shall be permitted only in the C3 District.
(2) Shall have a maximum sign area of 40 square feet on each of a
maximum of two sides.

§ 27-708. Vehicles Functioning as Signs.
Any vehicle or structure to which a sign is affixed in such a manner that the
carrying of such sign or signs no longer is incidental to the primary purpose
of the vehicle or structure but becomes a primary purpose in itself shall be
considered a freestanding sign and as such shall be subject to requirements
for freestanding signs in the district in which such vehicle or structure is
located.
§ 27-709. Prohibited Signs.
F. Utility Poles. No sign shall be stapled or nailed to a utility pole,
except by an authorized utility.
1. See § 27-511, "Light, Glare and Heat Control."

area is less than 25 square feet and if the messages are static
and do not change more than once every 10 seconds.
C. Signs which emit smoke, visible vapors or particles, sound or odor.
D. Signs which contain information that states or implies that a lot
may be used for any purpose not permitted under the applicable
provisions of this chapter.
E. Signs that are of such character, form, shape or color that they
imitate or resemble any official traffic sign, signal or device or that
have any characteristics which are likely to confuse or distract the
operator of a motor vehicle on a public street (such as prominent
use of the word "danger" or "stop").

§ 27-710. Construction of Signs.
Every permanent sign permitted in this section shall be constructed of
durable materials and shall be kept in good condition and repair. Any sign
which becomes dilapidated or unsafe may be repaired or removed by the

purposes, except as provided as a special sale sign.
I. Floodlights and lasers, except as is permitted as a special sale
display under § 27-703.
1. Sign Definitions. The following definitions shall be used in determining
whether signs meet the measurement and type requirements of this
Part:
BUILDING FACE  The vertical area of a particular side of a building,
but not including the area of any slanted roof.
FREESTANDING SIGN  A sign which is self-supporting upon the
ground or which is primarily supported by poles attached to the ground
and not primarily supported by a building.
HEIGHT OF SIGN  The vertical distance measured from the average
ground level surrounding a sign to the highest point of the sign and
its supporting structure. If the grade of an immediately adjacent street
or highway is higher than the grade of land where the sign is located,
the height of the sign may be measured from the height of the adjacent
street or highway. Religious symbols shall not be restricted by the sign
heights of this Part when attached to a tower or spire of a place of
worship.
ILLUMINATED SIGN, EXTERNALLY  A sign illuminated by light
outside of the sign instead of within the sign.
ILLUMINATED SIGN, INTERNALLY  A sign illuminated by light from
within the sign rather than a source adjacent to or outside of the sign. A
sign within a display case with lights only shining onto the front of the
sign shall be considered to be "externally" illuminated.
OFF-PREMISES SIGN  See Part 2.
SIGN  See Part 2.
§ 27-709 FOREWORD § 27-711
FWD:1093
§ 27-712. Off-Premises Signs (Including Billboards).
WALL SIGN  A sign primarily supported by or painted on a wall of
a building and which does not project more than 18 inches from such
wall.
WINDOW SIGN  A sign which is readily visible and can be at least
partially read from an exterior lot line and which is attached to a
window or transparent door or that can be read through a window or
transparent door and which is not internally illuminated and that is
constructed of paper or similar nonpermanent material or is painted on
the window. Signs within windows that do not meet this definition shall
be regulated as a wall sign.
2. Measurement of Sign Area.
A. Sign area shall include all lettering, wording and accompanying
designs and symbols, together with related background areas on
which they are displayed. One freestanding sign may include
several signs that are all attached to one structure, with the total
sign area being the total area of all signs on the structure.
B. The sign area shall not include any structurally supporting
framework, solid base, or bracing if such area does not include any
display, lettering or sign and if such area is clearly incidental to the
sign area itself.
C. Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to
or painted directly on a building or window, other than an
illuminated background that is a part of the sign, the sign area shall
be the smallest rectangle or circle, or two or three smallest
rectangles or circles, that include all of the letters and symbols.
D. In computing the permitted sign area of a sign with two sides, the
permitted total sign area shall be based upon the sign area of only
one side (the larger of any two if they differ). If the interior angle
formed at the inside of the two sides of a two-sided sign is greater
than 60°, then the total area of both sides shall not be greater than
the permitted total sign area. No sign shall have more than two
sides or faces.
E. Unless otherwise specified, all square footages in regard to signs
are maximum sizes.
1. Purposes. Off-premises signs are controlled by this chapter for the
following purposes: to ensure that a physical environment is maintained
that is attractive to desirable types of development, especially light
industrial and office parks; to prevent visual pollution in the Township
and protect property values, especially in consideration of the fact that
most commercial areas of the Township are within close proximity to
existing residences; to prevent glare on adjacent property and streets;
to protect the open space and natural character of areas of the
§ 27-711 SALISBURY CODE § 27-712
FWD:1094
Township planned to remain agricultural or as conservation areas;
to avoid the creation of additional visual distractions to motorists,
especially along the high-speed expressways and along busy arterial
streets that involve complex turning movements, congestion and
numerous traffic hazards; to recognize the numerous alternative forms
of free speech available in the Township, including existing
nonconforming off-premises signs, on-premises signs and temporary
signs and printed and electronic media; to recognize that this chapter
allows every landowner a reasonable use for their land; to avoid offpremises
signs that would have an unfair advantage over on-premises
signs in the competition for attention, because off-premises signs
typically are higher and larger than on-premises signs; and to carry out
the purposes listed in § 27-701.
2. Nonconforming Off-Premises Signs. This section is not intended to
require the removal of an existing lawfully placed off-premises sign that
is in structurally sound condition.
3. Commercial and Noncommercial. This section applies to both
commercial and noncommercial off-premises signs, except as may be
specifically provided for elsewhere in this chapter.
4. PennDOT Sign. Signs erected and maintained by PennDOT or its
designee are permitted by right in all districts. Such signs that identify
business services available at an interchange are specifically
encouraged as an appropriate and orderly means of providing
information without causing visual pollution or traffic hazards.
5. Political Signs. See § 27-703.
6. Permitted Off-Premises Signs. Based directly on the intent statements
within this chapter, off-premises signs are only permitted if they meet
the following requirements, except for exempt signs under § 27-703:
A. District. An off-premises sign is only permitted in the C3 District,
except for types and sizes of other signs specifically authorized by
this Part.
B. Location. An off-premises sign is only permitted within a maximum
of 200 feet of an existing right-of-way of an arterial street and a
minimum of 10 feet from any nonresidential lot line.
C. Maximum Sign Area: 300 square feet.
D. Spacing. Any off-premises sign shall be separated by a minimum of
1,000 feet from any other off-premises sign, including signs on
either side of a street and including existing signs in other
municipalities. No lot shall include more than one off-premises
sign.
E. Maximum Height: 60 feet. See definition in § 27-711.
§ 27-712 FOREWORD § 27-712
FWD:1095
F. Attached. No off-premises sign or sign face shall be attached in any
way to any other off-premises sign. Off-premises signs shall have a
maximum of one sign face.
G. Lighting and Glare. See standards in § 27-511.
H. Residences. No off-premises sign shall be located within 400 feet of
an existing dwelling or undeveloped residentially zoned land.

GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 27-801. Frontage onto Improved Streets; Number of Uses or
Buildings; Minimum Size of Dwellings.
1. Frontage Required onto Improved Street.
A. A principal building shall only be built upon a lot with frontage on a
public street, except:
(1) A single lot that existed as a lawful recorded lot of record prior
to the adoption of this chapter and that is not proposed to be
subdivided and that is to be used for a single-family detached
dwelling shall be permitted to have access onto a public street
by means of a legally permanent access easement or private
street if such easement or private street provides safe and
convenient access and egress, including acceptable access for
emergency vehicles.
(2) A townhouse or condominium development may have access to
individual dwellings or buildings using a parking court and a
shared accessway/private street within the tract, provided that
such shared access/private street guarantees permanent
access (with a method for funding perpetual maintenance
approved by the Board of Commissioners under the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22])
from such dwellings or buildings to reach a public street.
(3) New lots may have access onto a private street if the private
street meets all of the requirements for a public street and if
there is an acceptable system in place to fund and complete
perpetual maintenance and repair of the street.
B. Any new lot that is granted subdivision approval shall have
frontage and direct access onto a public street, without traversing
through or over another lot, except as permitted above for a
townhouse or condominium development.
2. Multiple Uses in a Building. Occupancy of a principal commercial,
institutional or industrial building by more than one permitted use is
specifically allowed, provided that all other requirements of this
chapter are satisfied.
3. Multiple Buildings on a Lot. An approved commercial, institutional,
industrial, townhouse or garden apartment lot may include more than
one principal building. In such case, the minimum front, side and rear
yard requirements shall only apply at lot lines of the property.
Individual buildings or portions of such buildings may be held in
approved condominium ownership, but the lot shall be owned by a

single legal entity. In cases not meeting this subsection, only one
principal building shall be permitted per lot.
4. Minimum Size of Dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a minimum
of 700 square feet of habitable, indoor, heated floor area, except such
minimum for apartment units shall be 500 square feet.
5. For shopping center and office developments under the same
ownership and consolidated for the purposes of development or phased
development comprised of more than one building site, the
development shall be served by an internal circulation network. All
access to outparcels shall utilize the internal circulation network rather
than separate connections to arterial roads. The required
documentation pursuant to § 22-1004, Subsection 3B, of the SALDO
shall also be required for outparcels.
1. Height Exceptions.
A. The maximum structure height specified for each district shall not
apply to: farm silos and associated agricultural structures,
communications towers, amateur radio antennas (see § 27-403),
water towers, clock or bell towers, steeples of places of worship,
mechanical equipment areas, skylights, electrical transmission
lines, elevator shafts, wind turbines, chimneys or other
appurtenances usually required to be and customarily placed above
the roof level and not intended for human occupancy.
B. For the above exempted structures, the maximum height shall be
250 feet above the average surrounding ground level, unless a
different maximum is established for a use elsewhere in this
chapter.
2. Height and Airport Approaches. At a minimum, any structure proposed
to have a height of 75 feet or more above average surrounding ground
level shall present sufficient information to the Zoning Officer to prove
that the structure would comply with all applicable federal, state and
Township requirements regarding airport approaches and warning
lights. See Appendix A regarding airport approaches.121
1. Sight Distance at Intersections.
A. Intent: to ensure that traffic passing through an intersection or
turning onto a street can safely see oncoming traffic.
B. A triangular area as described in this section shall be graded and
shall be kept free of sight obstructions between a height of two and
121. Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 27-801 SALISBURY CODE § 27-803
FWD:1098
eight feet, including structures, nontransparent fences, vegetation
and signs (but not including signposts or utility posts of less than
one foot in width or the trunks of deciduous trees).
C. This sight distance triangle shall be shown on development plans
submitted to the Township and be shown on any plan required to be
recorded. Such triangle shall serve as a permanent setback line for
all such visual obstructions and shall be binding upon present and
future owners of the land.
D. If a driveway, accessway or street would enter onto a state street,
the required sight triangle to be included on the development plan
shall be that necessary to achieve the minimum sight distance
required by PennDOT regulations.
E. Where a driveway, accessway or street would enter onto a street
that is not state-owned, the required sight triangle to be included
on the development plan shall be that necessary to achieve the
minimum sight distance that would have been needed to meet
PennDOT regulations if a state street was involved.
F. These sight distance requirements shall apply to all intersections
involving a public street and another street, accessway or driveway,
except these requirements shall not apply to an individual driveway
serving only one or two dwelling units that enters onto a local or
collector street.
G. A sight distance triangle shall apply for each direction of approach
to an intersection.
H. For any existing residential driveway entrance to an arterial street
that is proposed to be used for a new nonresidential principal use,
the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Township
Engineer that such entrance will meet PennDOT sight distance
requirements in both directions as would apply to a new driveway
on such street. If such sight distance cannot be met, then the use
shall be denied.
2. Buffer Yards. Buffer yards and screening complying with the following
standards shall be required under the following situations:
A. Buffer Yard Width, When Required. Buffer yards with evergreen
screening shall be required in the following situations:

Required to provide
a buffer yard under
another section of
this chapter
20, unless stated
otherwise
B. Location of Buffer Yards.
(1) The buffer yard shall be measured from the district boundary
line, future street right-of-way line or lot line, whichever is
applicable.
(2) Plants needed for the visual screen shall not be placed within a
future street right-of-way. The required buffer yard width shall
be in addition to the required future street right-of-way.
(3) The buffer yard may include areas within a required front, side
or rear yard, or a paved area setback area, provided the larger
yard requirement shall apply in case of overlap.
§ 27-803 SALISBURY CODE § 27-803
FWD:1100
(4) A business use shall not be required to provide a buffer yard
for an adjacent residential use or district if the uses/districts
are separated by an expressway. However, outdoor storage or
tractor-trailer parking adjacent to an expressway shall still
provide any required buffer yard and screening.
C. Characteristics of Buffer Yards.
(1) The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage or display,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas or vehicle parking or display. No new
driveways or streets shall be permitted in the buffer yards
except at points of approved crossings for ingress or egress.
(2) Maintenance. In buffer yards, all areas not covered by trees
and shrubs shall be well-maintained in an all-season vegetative
ground cover (such as grass) and shall be kept free of debris
and rubbish and shall not include grass areas higher than eight
inches.
(3) Preservation of Existing Vegetation/Slopes. If an applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, after a review
by the Planning Commission, that an existing healthy tree line,
attractive thick vegetation, natural earth berm and/or steep
slopes will be preserved and serve the same buffer purposes as
plant screening that would otherwise be required, then such
preserved existing buffer shall be permitted to be used in place
of planting new plants. In such case, the width of the buffer
yard required by § 27-803, Subsection 2A, shall still apply. If
this existing buffer requirement is removed, the applicant shall
be required to plant a buffer yard that will meet the planting
requirements of this section.
(4) Fence. Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside
of any required evergreen screening.
D. Planting Screen.
(1) Each buffer yard shall include a planting screen of trees or
shrubs extending the full length of the lot line.
(2) Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
(a) Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have
a minimum height when planted of four feet.
(b) Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such
species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to
produce within three years a solid year-round visual
screen at least six feet in height.
§ 27-803 FOREWORD § 27-803
FWD:1101
(c) The plant screen shall be permanently maintained by
present and future landowners. Any plants needed to form
the visual screen that die or are removed shall be replaced
within 120 days.
(d) The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the
plants will be at least five feet from any cartway and will
not grow over an exterior lot line.
(e) The plant visual screen shall be interrupted only at:
1) Approved points of vehicle or pedestrian ingress and
egress to the lot;
2) Locations necessary to comply with the sight distance
requirements of § 27-803; and
3) Locations needed to meet other specific state and
Township requirements.
(f) Evergreen trees likely to grow substantially in diameter
should be planted in two or more rows or offsets if needed
to allow space for future growth, as seen in the sketch
below.
E. Buffer Yard Plans.
(1) Prior to the issuance of a permit under this chapter where a
buffer yard would be required, and on any required subdivision
or land development plan, the applicant shall submit plans
showing:
(a) The location and arrangement of each buffer yard.
(b) The placement, general selection of species and initial size
of all plant materials.
(c) The placement, size, materials and type of all fences to be
placed in such buffer yard.
(2) The Zoning Officer shall review such plans to determine that
the plans are in conformance with the terms of this chapter.
F. Species of Plants in Screening. Trees and shrubs needed to form a
required visual screen shall be of the following or closely related
species, unless the applicant uses standard reference material or a
letter from a registered landscape architect to prove to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a substitution would be
appropriate. A required visual screen shall primarily include
evergreen plants. Leafy deciduous plants may be selectively used,
provided that their use does not result in significant visual

the Zoning Officer after providing sufficient evidence.
2. Continuation of Nonconformity. A lawful nonconforming use, structure
or lot, as defined by this chapter, may be continued and may be sold and
continued by new owners. Any expansion of, construction upon or
change in use of a nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with
this section.
3. Expansion of, Construction upon or Change in Use of Nonconformities.
A. Nonconforming Structure.
(1) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to
be reconstructed or expanded, provided:
(a) That such action will not increase the severity or amount
of the nonconformity (such as the area of the building
extending into the required setback) or create any new
nonconformity.
(b) That any expanded area will comply with the applicable
setbacks in that district and other requirements of this
chapter.
(c) That if the structure uses an on-lot septic system, the
Township Sewage Enforcement Officer determines that
such system is adequate for the proposed use.
(2) In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a
nonconforming use, any expansion shall also meet the
requirements of this section regarding nonconforming uses.
B. Nonconforming Lot.
§ 27-804 SALISBURY CODE § 27-806
FWD:1104
(1) New permitted structures for a single permitted-by-right
principal use and its customary accessory uses may be
constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming
lot of record as a permitted-by-right use if all of the following
requirements are met:
(a) The lot area is at least 40% of the minimum lot area.
(b) The lot width is at least 40% of the minimum lot width.
(c) The lot is a lot of record that lawfully existed prior to the
adoption of this chapter or an applicable subsequent
amendment.
(d) Minimum setbacks and other requirements of this chapter
are complied with for any new construction or expanded
area, unless another section of this chapter specifically
allows an exception, such as in § 27-307 or 27-801.
(e) If a new principal building will be served by an on-lot
septic system, the lot shall comply with all state septic
regulations and shall provide an approved alternative
drainfield location. An expansion of an existing building
may be required to provide an expanded drainfield, under
DEP regulations.
(f) For a dwelling on a nonconforming lot, the front door shall
face a public street, and the dwelling shall have a side
facing onto a public street that has an appearance typical
of a front of a dwelling.
(2) Setbacks. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a special
exception to reduce the required setbacks for construction on
a nonconforming lot if the Board determines that such
reduction would result in a building that would be more
compatible with neighboring residences than would be built if
the setback requirement was not reduced.
(3) Merger. If two contiguous nonconforming lots under common
ownership include at least one lot that is less than 40% of the
required lot area, and if at least one of the lots did not include a
principal building, then the two lots shall be merged to form
one lot that would be conforming or less nonconforming. This
provision shall only apply if one or both of the lots has a lot
area of less than 6,000 square feet.
(4) If a proposed development on a nonconforming lot does not
meet the requirements of the above § 27-806, Subsection 3B(1)
and (2), then development of the lot shall not occur unless a
variance is granted by the Zoning Hearing Board. In addition
to the standards stated for a variance in the MPC, 53 P.S.
§ 10101 et seq., the Zoning Hearing Board shall also review
§ 27-806 FOREWORD § 27-806
FWD:1105
whether any alternative permitted uses could reasonably be
made of the property that would less significantly adversely
impact upon the established character of an existing
residential neighborhood than the proposed use.
C. Expansion of a Nonconforming Nonresidential Use. A
nonconforming use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall
not be expanded, except in accordance with the following
provisions:
(1) An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall
require special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing
Board under § 27-120.
(2) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same
lot that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time
the use became nonconforming.
(3) The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use, or
the total area covered by impervious surfaces of a
nonconforming use, shall not be increased by greater than 25%
beyond each such measurement that existed in such use at the
time such use became nonconforming. These maximum
increases shall be measured in aggregate over the entire life of
the nonconformity.
(4) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this chapter, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
D. Expansion of a Nonconforming Residential Use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded in floor area as a
permitted-by-right use, provided that:
(1) The number of dwelling units is not increased.
(2) The expansion meets all applicable setbacks.
(3) No new types of nonconformities are created.
(4) A nonconformity is not made more severe (including the
building area within the required setback area).
4. Damaged or Destroyed Nonconformities.
A. A nonconforming structure that has been destroyed or damaged
equal to 50% or more of its total value by fire, windstorm, lightning
or a similar cause deemed not to be the fault of the owner may be
rebuilt in a nonconforming fashion only if:
(1) The application for a building permit is submitted within 18
months after the date of damage or destruction.
(2) Work begins in earnest within 12 months afterwards.
§ 27-806 SALISBURY CODE § 27-806
FWD:1106
(3) A nonconformity shall not be created or increased by any
reconstruction.
B. Rebuilding of a damaged or destroyed nonconformity shall not
begin until plans for rebuilding have been presented and approved
by the Zoning Officer. Any change of one nonconforming use to
another nonconforming use shall comply with the provisions of this
section.
C. Nonconforming Use of Open Land. All nonconforming off-premises
signs, junkyards, outside storage areas and similar nonconforming
uses of open land, when damaged to an extent of 50% or more of
replacement cost, shall not be continued, repaired or
reconstructed.
5. Abandonment of a Nonconformity.
A. If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed,
removed or abandoned for 365 or more days, subsequent use of
such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, except:
(1) As provided for in the "damaged or destroyed nonconformities"
provisions of this section; and
(2) If a nonconforming off-premises junkyard, outside storage area
or similar nonconforming use of open land is discontinued for
30 days or more, the use shall not be continued, repaired or
reconstructed.
B. The applicant shall be responsible to provide evidence that the
nonconformity was not abandoned.
6. Floodplains. See the Township Floodplain Ordinance [Chapter 8].
7. Changes from One Nonconforming Use to Another.
A. Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land or portion
thereof shall not revert to a nonconforming use.
B. A nonconforming use may be changed to a different type of
nonconforming use only if permitted as a special exception by the
Zoning Hearing Board. The Board shall determine whether the
applicant has provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed
new use will be equally or less objectionable in external effects
compared to the pre-existing nonconforming use. The Board should
review the following types of effects:
(1) Traffic generation (especially truck traffic).
(2) Noise, dust, fumes, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire and
explosive hazards.
(3) Amount and character of outdoor storage.
§ 27-806 FOREWORD § 27-806
FWD:1107
§ 27-807. Temporary Structure or Use.
(4) Hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings.
(5) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
8. District Changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated
under this section on nonconformities.
1. Construction Vehicle Parking and Temporary Offices. See "essential
services," a permitted-by-right accessory use, in § 27-306.
2. Tents. The following are permitted-by-right accessory uses: tents
erected for a use during a maximum of five days in any calendar year
for:
A. Routine and customary accessory noncommercial uses; and
B. A routine and customary accessory use to an existing commercial
use.
3. Temporary Uses by Conditional Use. For temporary structures or uses
that are not specifically permitted by right by this chapter, and other
than those uses that were lawfully occurring on a periodic basis prior to
the adoption of this chapter, a temporary permit may be issued by the
Board of Commissioners as a conditional use for structures or uses,
subject to the following additional provisions:
A. Duration. The Board of Commissioners shall establish a limit on the
duration of the use. In the case of a special event, except under
special circumstances, this should be a maximum of six days in any
sixty-day period. The Board of Commissioners may grant a single
approval once for numerous occurrences of an event. Except for
reoccurring special events, there is a maximum two-year period.
B. Statement from Owner. The applicant shall present a statement
from the owner of record of the land accepting responsibility to
ensure that the use or structure is removed once the permit
expires.
C. Removal. Such structure or use shall be removed completely upon
expiration of the permit without cost to the Township. If the
structure or use is not removed in a timely fashion after proper
notification, the Township may remove the use or structure at the
cost of the person who owns the land upon which the structure or
use is located.
D. Conditions. The temporary use or structure shall:
(1) Be compatible with adjacent uses; and
(2) Clearly be of a temporary nature.
§ 27-806 SALISBURY CODE § 27-807
FWD:1108
E. Fee. The Board of Commissioners may waive and/or return the
required application fee if the applicant is an Internal Revenue
Service recognized and well-established nonprofit organization and
the applicant clearly shows that the proposed use is temporary and
will be used to clearly primarily serve a charitable or public service
purpose.
F. Nonprofit. Only a well-established and Internal Revenue Service
recognized nonprofit organization proposing a temporary use to
clearly primarily serve a charitable or public service purpose shall
be eligible to receive approval for a temporary commercial use in a
district where that use is not permitted.
G. Special Events. For a special event that will attract significant
numbers of the public, the Board of Commissioners may deny the
use if it determines that the following will not be generally
appropriate: sanitary and water service, traffic control, off-street
parking, and protection of the public health and safety.
4. Portable Storage Containers.
A. This section shall apply to a portable storage container that is kept
outside of a building and which has a length greater than 10 feet
and which is not currently attached to a motor vehicle or railroad
and which is not part of a permitted principal industrial use.
B. The following regulations shall apply on a principally residential
lot:
(1) A portable storage container shall not be kept on a principally
residential lot for a total of more than 60 days in any two-year
period, unless it is necessary for storage as part of an active
construction permit for the lot. A temporary zoning permit
shall be required if the portable storage container is kept on
the lot for more than 30 days.
(2) A maximum of one portable storage container shall be allowed
per lot.
C. On a lot that is not a principally residential lot, any portable storage
container that is kept on a lot for more than 30 days shall meet the
setbacks that apply to a principal building, unless it is necessary to
temporarily hold materials for on-site construction.
D. The following shall apply to any portable storage container:
(1) The container shall not obstruct safe sight distances at
intersections.
(2) The container shall not obstruct travel lanes of a street or a
public sidewalk or a handicapped ramp.

The requirements of the SALDO [Chapter 22] shall apply.
§ 27-809. Industrial and Commercial Driveways.
A driveway or accessway serving a commercial or industrial use shall be
deemed to be integral with such use and shall not be a permitted use
in a residential district. This restriction shall not apply to a driveway or
accessway that will be clearly limited to use by only emergency vehicles.
§ 27-810. Traffic Studies.
(3) The container shall only be allowed to be placed within a street
right-of-way if a permit for such placement is issued by the
Township. Such permit shall specify a maximum number of
days during which the container may be placed within the
right-of-way.
(4) The container shall not be used to store hazardous, explosive
or toxic substances or putrescent garbage.
(5) A facility that stores portable storage containers that have
been leased by others or are available for lease shall be
considered a warehouse.
1. Purposes. The purposes of a traffic study are:
A. To determine the safety and congestion impacts, and related costs,
of proposed major traffic-generating uses.
B. To require that applicants respond with reasonable proposals to
resolve the negative traffic impacts that their proposed uses will
cause on the public.
C. To recognize that sufficient federal, state and Township funds are
not available to resolve traffic problems caused by private
development.
D. To assist in carrying out Sections 503(2)(ii) and 503(3) of the
Pennsylvania MPC, as amended.
E. To ensure that streets bordering a site plan, subdivision or land
development are coordinated and of such widths and grades and in
such locations as deemed necessary to accommodate prospective
traffic and to facilitate fire protection.
F. To ensure that the access into and out of site plans, subdivisions
and land developments is reasonably safe.
2. Uses Requiring a Traffic Study. Where a site plan, subdivision or land
development is estimated to generate 500 trips per day or more (as
based on the generation rates included in the Institute of
§ 27-807 SALISBURY CODE § 27-810
FWD:1110
Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation Manual, the latest edition),
a developer shall submit a traffic study and report meeting the
requirements of § 22-1018 of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance. A traffic study is also required for the following proposed
projects:
A. Residential: 50 or more dwelling units.
B. Commercial: 15,000 square feet or more of total floor area.
C. Office: 15,000 square feet or more of total floor area.
D. Industrial: 40,000 square feet or more of total floor area or any
trucking company terminal.
E. Institutional: 20,000 square feet or more of total floor area.
F. Any use or combination of uses that would result in an average of
more than 1,000 trips per day.
G. Any use or combination of uses on a lot or on a tract, including
contiguous lots in common ownership, that currently generates
over 1,500 trips per day and would involve additional proposed
development that would generate an additional 500 or more trips
per day.
3. The traffic study shall meet the requirements of the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance (see § 22-1018 of such ordinance).
4. The Township may have a traffic study reviewed by a professional
engineer or a transportation consultant, with the reasonable costs of
such review required to be reimbursed by the applicant.

§ 27-906. PRD Site Analysis.
3. Building Siting, Building Coverage and Net Residential Density. Within
the general standards established in § 27-905, Subsections 1 and 2, the
suitability of building siting, building coverage and net residential
density will be determined subject to the standards set forth for the site
design of residential uses and common open space in § 27-907,
Subsections 1 and 2, and the determinations of the site analysis as set
forth in § 27-906.
1. Natural Features Analysis. In order to determine which specific areas of
the total PRD site are best suited for higher-density development, which
areas are best suited for lower-density development and which areas
should be preserved in their natural state as open space areas, a
thorough analysis of the natural features of the site is required. The
following subject categories must be included in this analysis:
A. Hydrology. Analysis of natural drainage patterns and water
resources, including an analysis of streams, natural drainage
swales, ponds or lakes, wetlands, floodplain areas, permanent high
water table areas, and seasonal high water table areas.
B. Geological. Analysis of characteristics of rock formations
underlying the site, including defining aquifers (particularly those
locally subject to pollution), shallow bedrock areas and areas in
which rock formations are unstable.
C. Soils. Analysis of types of soils present in the site area, including
delineation of prime agricultural soil areas, aquifer recharge soil
areas, unstable soils, soils most susceptible to erosion, and soils
suitable for urban development. The analysis of soils shall be based
on the County Soil Survey or more-detailed professional study.
D. Topography. Analysis of the terrain of the site, including mapping of
elevation and delineation of slope areas over 25%, between 15%
and 25%, and between 12% and 15%.
E. Vegetation. Analysis of tree and plant cover of the site, emphasizing
the location of woodland and meadowland areas. Dominant tree
and plant species should be identified and the characteristics of
each understood.
F. Microclimate. Analysis of seasonal temperatures, seasonal
precipitation, seasonal prevailing winds and daily hours of sunlight
in specific areas of the PRD site.
2. Community Impact Analysis. In order to determine the impacts of the
proposed PRD, an analysis of the potential effects of the PRD upon
public facilities, utilities, public school systems and roadway systems
will be required. A comparison of the projected costs versus the
revenues to the Township and the school district produced by the PRD
shall be included in the analysis.

the scale and character of the planned development, considering
its natural features, size, land use intensity, potential population
and the number and types of dwelling units to be developed.
C. Whenever possible, common open space shall be designed as a
contiguous area interspersed with residential areas with
pedestrian and visual access available to all residents of the PRD.
D. Significant natural features, such as woodland areas, large trees,
natural watercourses and bodies of water, rock outcroppings and
scenic views, shall be incorporated into common open space areas
whenever possible; provided, however, that no less than 25% of the

Section 705(f) of the MPC.
4. Public Dedication of Common Open Space. An offer of dedication of
common open space made by the developer in the development plan
before the establishment of any organization responsible for common
open space areas which is accepted by the Township shall constitute a
fulfillment of responsibility for providing and maintaining common open
space areas. No such dedication shall be deemed to have been accepted
by the Township unless the Board of Commissioners takes formal action
to accept the dedication.
§ 27-907 SALISBURY CODE § 27-910
FWD:1118
§ 27-910. PRD Staging.
§ 27-911. PRD Procedures.
1. A PRD may be developed in stages if the following standards are met:
A. The location and approximate time of construction of each stage is
clearly marked on the development plan.
B. At least 15% of the dwelling units in the development plan are
included in the first stage.
C. At least 33% of the dwelling units are rented or sold before any
commercial development is completed.
D. All stages shall be completed consistent with the development plan
and shall be of such size and location that they constitute
economically sound units of development. In no event shall any one
stage contain less than 15% of the total dwelling units included in
the development plan.
E. Density. To encourage flexibility of housing density, design and type
in accord with the purposes of this chapter, gross residential
density may be varied from stage to stage. A gross residential
density in one stage which exceeds the permitted average gross
residential density for the entire PRD must be offset by a gross
residential density less than the permitted average gross

the MPC.
1. See Section 712.2 of the MPC.
2. Enforcement. To further the mutual interest of the residents of the PRD
and of the public in the preservation of the integrity of the development
plan, as finally approved, and to ensure that modifications, if any, in the
development plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the said
residents upon the provisions of the development plan, as approved,
nor result in changes that would adversely affect the public interest, the
enforcement and modification of the provisions of the development plan
as finally approved, whether those are recorded by plat, covenant,
easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the following provisions:
A. The provisions of the development plan relating to: (1) the use, bulk
and location of buildings and structures; (2) the quantity and
location of common open space, except as otherwise provided in
this chapter; and (3) the intensity of use or the density of
residential units, shall run in favor of the Township and shall be
enforceable in law or in equity by the Township, without limitation
on any powers of regulation otherwise granted the Township by
law.
B. All provisions of the development plan shall run in favor of the
residents of the PRD but only to the extent expressly provided in
the development plan and in accordance with the terms of the
development plan, and to that extent said provisions, whether
recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be
enforced by law or equity by said residents acting individually,
jointly or through an organization designated in the development
plan to act on their behalf; provided, however, that no provisions of
the development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of residents
of the PRD except as to those portions of the development plan
which have been finally approved and have been recorded.
3. Modifications. All those provisions of the development plan authorized
to be enforced by the Township under this section may be modified,
removed or released by the Township, except grants or easements
relating to the service or equipment of a public utility, subject to the
following conditions:
A. No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the Township shall affect the rights of the
residents of the PRD to maintain and enforce those provisions, at
law or in equity, as provided in this section.
B. No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the Township shall be permitted except upon
§ 27-911 SALISBURY CODE § 27-912
FWD:1124
a finding by the Board of Commissioners, following a public hearing
thereon pursuant to public notice called and held in accordance
with the provisions of this Part, that the same is consistent with
the efficient development and preservation of the entire PRD, does
not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or
across the street from the PRD or the public interest, and is not
granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
C. Residents of the PRD may, to the extent and in the manner
expressly authorized by the provisions of the development plan,
modify, remove or release their rights to enforce the provisions of
the development plan, but no such action shall affect the right of
the Township to enforce the provisions of the development plan in
accordance with the provisions of this section.

demonstrates that the new area will meet the requirements of this
§ 27-1005.
5. The open space and/or recreation area/recreation fee requirements
referenced in other sections of this chapter or other Township
ordinances shall apply only to residential halls for students studying a

be required to be dedicated to the Township.
6. In consideration of the requirement to have and maintain an approved
and coordinated open land plan which shall include woodland
protection (as applicable) and which shall include landscaping and
buffering as referenced in § 27-1006, the provisions stated in § 27-516,
Subsection 6C, and § 27-516, Subsection 10D, shall not apply.

the requirements of § 27-1006. The berm, buffer, screening and any
related setback requirements referenced in other sections of this
chapter or in other Township ordinances shall not apply to a health care

2. If an applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, after a
recommendation by the Planning Commission, that existing healthy
trees and other vegetation will be preserved (and/or supplemented if
necessary with additional plantings, berms, fences or walls) to provide
a visual screen as effective as the berms, fences, walls, and plantings
required under this section, then such existing trees and vegetation to
be preserved (and/or supplemented if necessary) may be approved to
satisfy the landscape, berm and buffer requirements of this § 27-1006.
3. The berm and landscape buffer requirements as listed below shall not
be required where a health care campus is separated from a residential
lot by a public street that existed as of May 31, 2012.*
4. In a health care campus, a berm and landscape buffer shall be
constructed, or an existing berm and landscape buffer supplemented as
needed to meet this § 27-1006, along abutting residential lots within
Salisbury Township as well as between the existing residential use
fronting and taking access from Caroline Road and the remainder of the
health care campus when a nonresidential building, parking structure,
parking area or driveways serving nonresidential buildings will be
constructed as part of a health care campus. The berm and landscape
buffer may be constructed within the required paved area setback. The
§ 27-1005 FOREWORD § 27-1006
FWD:1135
berm and landscape buffer shall only be required where the proposed
nonresidential building, parking structure, outdoor storage tank,
parking area or driveway serving nonresidential buildings will be
visible from the abutting residential property, after considering any
preserved or newly planted plantings.

B. Primarily coniferous (evergreen) screening shall be used for the
buffer plantings and shall be provided on and/or near the top, and
along the residential side of the berm. The berm shall be designed
to provide sufficient soil and retain sufficient moisture or provide
irrigation to support the plantings. Leafy deciduous plants may be
selectively used, provided that their use does not result in
significant visual openings during the winter. Plant species shall be
from the list in § 27-803, Subsection 2F, of this chapter, unless the
applicant provides a letter from a registered landscape architect
recommending alternative plant species satisfactory to the
Township Zoning Officer. The use of native plant species is
encouraged. Following construction of any buildings or structures
on a health care campus, upon review of the construction, the
Township Zoning Officer may require additional plantings be
installed along a berm as may be necessary to supplement the
buffer.
C. The berm and/or planting screen shall be continuous along such
boundary, except at approved driveway entrances and exits,
including as may be required to provide adequate sight distance for
traffic.
D. The berm and buffer area shall be free of buildings, dumpsters,
parking, compactors, and commercial or industrial storage or
display.
E. The berm shall have a maximum side slope of two horizontal to one
vertical on the residential side, and the toe of slope shall be a
minimum of 25 feet from the residential property line. The 25 feet
may be used for utilities and stormwater management swales and
facilities. The maximum slope on the nonresidential side of the
berm may be two horizontal to one vertical or steeper if a retaining
wall or other earth stabilization methods are used. The entire berm
shall be well-maintained. All areas not covered by trees, shrubs or
mulch shall be covered with an all-season vegetative ground cover
and shall be kept free of debris and rubbish. Fences and walls used
for screening in combination with berms shall not be regulated in
height.
