1:133
§ 67-9. Location, design and construction.
VEHICLE  Any device in, upon or by which any person or property is
or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway.
A. All driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in such a
manner as not to interfere or be inconsistent with the design,
maintenance and drainage of the highway.
B. Access driveways shall be located in such manner so that they will not
cause interference with the traveling public, a hazard to the free
movement of normal highway traffic, nor areas of undue traffic
congestion on the highway. In accordance with this principle, driveways
should be located where the highway alignment and profile are
favorable, i.e., where there are no sharp curves or steep grades and
where sight distance in conjunction with the driveway access would be
adequate for safe traffic operation.
C. Access driveways should not be located at interchanges, ramp areas or
locations that would interfere with the placement and proper
functioning of highway signs, signals, detectors, lighting or other
devices that affect traffic control. The location of a driveway near a
signalized intersection that has an actuated traffic signal may include a

shoulders. If, in the opinion of the Roadmaster, a pipe is required to
maintain the grade line, the permittee shall install such pipe, at his
expense, parallel to the pavement edge and at a minimum distance
of 10 feet therefrom and on the grade line as directed by the
Roadmaster (unless advised to the contrary by the Township
Engineer).
(2) Where a pipe is placed in the shoulder line, the driveway may slope
away from the roadway at a lesser gradient than the normal
shoulder slope but not less than 1/4 inch per foot from the paving
edge to the pipe.
(3) The minimum pipe length shall be equal to the width of the
driveway plus eight feet.
§ 67-8 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 67-10
1:134
§ 67-10. Number and arrangement of access driveways.
The permissible number, arrangement and width of driveways shall be
governed in part by the highway frontage of abutting private property. The
number of driveways permitted shall be the minimum number required to
serve adequately the needs of the abutting property. Frontages of 50 feet or
less shall be limited to one driveway. Normally not more than two driveways
need to be provided to any single property tract or business establishment.
Exception may be made where the frontage exceeds 300 feet in length or
where the frontage is along a divided highway. In such instances, requests
for additional driveways shall require prior approval from the Township.
§ 67-11. Approaches to driveways.
§ 67-12. Standards and specifications.
A. The location and angle of an access driveway approach in relation to
the highway intersection shall be such that a vehicle entering the
driveway may do so in an orderly and safe manner and with a minimum
of interference with through highway traffic and a vehicle leaving the
driveway may enter safely into the lane of traffic moving in the desired
direction.
B. Where the access driveway approach and highway pavement meet,
flaring of the approach may be necessary to allow safe, easy turning of
the vehicle when entering or departing from the driveway.
C. No part of any access driveway shall be constructed outside of the
applicant's frontage.
D. Each roadside business establishment shall provide sufficient parking
or storage space off the right-of-way to prevent the storage of vehicles
on the driveway or the backing up of traffic on the traveled roadway.
E. No part of the highway right-of-way shall be used for servicing of
vehicles, displays or conducting a private business. The area between
the edge of the pavement and the right-of-way line shall be kept clear of
all buildings, sales exhibits, business signs, parking areas, service
equipment, etc., excluding mailboxes.
F. Improvements on private property adjacent to the right-of-way shall be
so located that parking, stopping and maneuvering of vehicles on the
right-of-way will not be necessary in order for vehicles or patrons to be
served properly.
A. Angle of access driveway approach.
(1) Control dimensions.
(a) Single driveway: as near 90° as site conditions permit.
(b) Two driveways.

[2] One-way operation: 75° minimum.
(2) Single access driveway approaches shall be positioned at right
angles [90°] to the highway or as near thereto as site conditions
permit. When two access driveways are constructed on the same
property frontage and used for one-way operations, each of these
driveways may be placed at less than a right angle, but not less
than 75° to the highway.
B. Corner clearance.
(1) Control dimensions.
(a) Rural: 30 feet minimum.
(b) Urban: 20 feet minimum.
(2) Corner clearance shall be a minimum of 100 feet for all
nonresidential uses and 40 feet for residential uses.
C. Intermediate island between multiple driveways.
(1) Control dimensions: 200 feet minimum.
(2) An intermediate island shall separate all multiple driveways
opening upon the same highway. The island area shall extend from
the shoulder line, ditch line or curbline to the right-of-way line.
(3) The intermediate island area shall be clearly defined.
D. Radius curb.
(1) Control dimensions. The maximum and minimum lengths for radius
curbs shall be as follows:
(a) Residential: five feet minimum; 20 feet maximum.
(b) Nonresidential: 25 feet minimum; 50 feet maximum.
E. Width of access driveway approaches.
(1) The width of driveways shall be as specified in the Towamencin
Township Engineering Standards, as last amended.
(2) The width of access driveways shall not exceed the above
dimensions when measured at right angles to the center line of
driveway. Where a commercial access driveway approach and the
highway pavement meet, flaring of the driveway shall be required
to allow safe and easy turning of the vehicle either into or out of a
commercial development.
F. Curb.
(1) All curb must be of a permanent type.
§ 67-12 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 67-12
1:136
(2) In areas where no curb exists, an eight-inch-high vertical face curb
shall be used.
(3) Where the property abutting the highway right-of-way will be used
for parking area, the Township may require curb to be placed. This
curb will be required to confine the traffic movement to the access
driveway and to prohibit encroachment upon sidewalks or shoulder
area.
G. Sight distance.
(1) Access driveways shall be located at a point of optimum sight
distance along the highway within the property frontage limits. The
profile of the driveway and the grading of the right-of-way area
shall provide a maximum sight distance so that the operator of a
vehicle departing from such a driveway will have optimum visibility
in either direction along the highway.
(2) Where adequate sight distances cannot be attained, the location of
the driveway will be at the discretion of the Township Engineer.
H. Slope of access driveway.
(1) All driveways shall be constructed in such a manner as not to
impair drainage within the highway right-of-way, alter the stability
of the roadway subgrade or materially change the drainage of
adjacent areas. Where open shoulders or berms exist, the grade of
a paved access driveway(s) shall slope away from the highway
pavement at the same rate as the existing shoulder (unless advised
to the contrary by the Township Engineer) for the width of the
shoulder. The gradient of a driveway beyond this point (within the
highway right-of-way) shall not be less than 1/4 inch per foot.
(2) Driveway ramps may extend from the face of the curb up to the
outer edge of the sidewalk area in those cases where a planted area
occurs between multiple driveways. The rate of slope for such
driveway ramps preferably should not exceed one inch per foot.
Where conditions are such that one inch per foot of slope is not
obtainable, the sidewalk area of the driveway may be lowered
sufficiently to obtain the allowable ramp slope and the sidewalk
may be warped up to meet the normal sidewalk grade at a rate of
slope not to exceed 3/8 inch per foot.
(3) Where a drainage ditch or swale exists, adequate pipe shall be
installed under the driveway (by the permittee) in accordance with
Township specifications. Minimum diameter of such drainage pipe
shall be 15 inches (or eleven-inch-by-eighteen-inch arch) unless
otherwise specified by the Township Engineer.
I. Access driveway pavement. Access driveways shall be appropriately
surfaced between the traveled road and the business or service area
with a stabilized material when specified by the Township Engineer.
§ 67-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 67-12
1:137
§ 67-13. Maintenance.
All driveways, adjacent areas and areas between such driveways, including
channelization, paving, drainage, etc., installed by the permittee shall be
maintained by the property owner in such a manner as not to interfere or
be inconsistent with the design, maintenance and drainage of the highway
or the safe and convenient passage of traffic upon the highway. The term
"adjacent area" shall apply only to that area within the permittee's property
line extended.
§ 67-14. Continuing effect.
These rules and regulations shall become effective on the 31st day of
December 1969 and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter until
amended, modified, revoked or rescinded by the Township.
J. Deceleration and acceleration lanes.
(1) The shoulder or berm area leading to the entrance driveway of a
business establishment or other roadside developments in rural
areas may be paved for a suitable distance to permit vehicles to
decelerate or accelerate in safety when entering or leaving the
property. Such paving shall be limited to the area in front of the
abutting property and shall be done by the property owner, at his
expense, in accordance with Township specifications.
(2) Special attention will be given to permit requests for the
construction of access driveways to large business establishments,
shopping centers, outdoor theaters, etc., particularly when the
volume of traffic generated may necessitate acceleration and
deceleration lanes, standby lanes, jughandles, channelization, etc.
In all such cases, the permittee will be advised that costs incident
to the construction of such additional roadway improvements shall
be at no expense to the Township. Such work shall be constructed
under the supervision and inspection of the Township.

D. The Impact Fee Schedule, as established by the Township.
E. Designation of transportation districts as set forth on the
Transportation Service Area Map identified as Exhibit A and
incorporated herein by reference.53
A. Where intended to assist in determining the appropriate amount of
traffic impact fees, the Township may require the preparation of special
transportation studies to determine the traffic generation or circulation
patterns in new nonresidential developments only; provided, however,
that no studies may be required where the proposed development will
not require a deviation from the land use assumptions used to create
the program.
B. Any such studies required by the Township shall be submitted prior to
the imposition of the impact fee and shall be considered in the
determination of the fee.
A. The impact fee for the transportation capital improvements shall be
based upon the total costs of the road improvements included in the
adopted Transportation Capital Improvements Plan within a given
transportation service area attributable to and necessitated by new
development within the service area, as defined, divided by the number
of anticipated peak-hour trips generated by all new development
consistent with the adopted Land Use Assumptions and calculated in
accordance with the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers, Fourth or subsequent editions, which is
hereby adopted by the Township, to equal a per-trip cost for
transportation improvements within the service area.
B. The specific impact fee for a specific new development or subdivision
within the service area for road improvements shall be determined as of

§ 76-25. Nonbinding impact fee estimate.
Prior to making an application for a building permit, an applicant may
request a nonbinding impact fee estimate from the Township, which shall
be based upon the maximum development potential of the site pursuant to
existing zoning regulations, unless the applicant specifies a lesser use of
development.
§ 76-26. Administration.
§ 76-27. Method of payment.
Payment of the transportation capital improvements impact fee shall be
made by the traffic generator prior to the issuance of a building permit by
the Township to the traffic generator for development on the applicable site.
§ 76-28. Credit.
Any applicant who shall perform, at his own expense and with the consent
and agreement of the Board of Supervisors, off-site improvements, as herein
defined, shall be eligible for a credit from the impact fee otherwise due in
the amount of the actual cost of such off-site improvements as approved
by the Township Engineer. Such credit shall not exceed the amount of the
impact fee.
A. Collection of impact fee. Impact fees due pursuant to this article shall
be collected by the Township in the manner or manners prescribed
herein prior to the issuance of a building permit.
B. Establishment of fund. Upon receipt of impact fees, the Township
Manager's office shall be responsible for the separate and proper
accounting of such fees. All such fees shall be deposited in interestbearing
accounts in a bank authorized to receive deposits of the
Township funds. Interest earned by each account shall be credited to
that account and shall be used solely for the purpose specified for funds
of such account.
C. Establishment and maintenance of accounts. The Township Manager's
office shall establish appropriate trust fund accounts and shall maintain
records whereby impact fees collected can be segregated for each
transportation district area.
D. Maintenance of records. The Township Manager's office shall maintain
and keep adequate financial records for each such account which shall
show the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account
for all moneys received and which shall ensure that the disbursement of
funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the
provision of projects specified in the program for the particular
transportation district area.
A. If the applicant makes such improvements, he must enter into an
agreement with the Board of Supervisors prior to the issuance of any

building permit. The agreement must establish the estimated cost of
the improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the
improvement, a requirement that the improvement be completed to
Township and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards
and design criteria and such other terms and conditions as deemed
necessary by the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors must
review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules,
determine if the improvement is an eligible improvement and
determine the amount of the applicable credit for such improvement to
be applied to the otherwise applicable impact fee prior to issuance of
any building permit. In no event shall the Board of Supervisors provide
a credit which is greater than the applicable impact fee. If, however, the
amount of the credit is calculated to be greater than the amount of the
impact fee due, the applicant may use such excess credit toward the
impact fees imposed on other building permits for development on the
same site and in the same ownership, provided that any such applicant
shall be required to supply financial security sufficient, in the judgment
of the Township, to cover the cost of any such improvement installed by
the applicant for which credit is sought.
B. An applicant shall be entitled as a credit against impact fees an amount
equal to the value of any road improvement construction which is
contained in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan and which
was performed at the applicant's expense.
A. Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be refunded,
together with interest earned thereon, to the payor of the fees under
the following circumstances:
(1) In the event that the Township completes or terminates the capital
improvements plan and there remain undisbursed funds, the
respective payors shall be entitled to a share of the fund balance in
the same proportion as the payor's impact fee payment, plus
interest earned, bears to the total impact fees collected, plus
interest.
(2) In the event that any specific road improvement project is
completed at a cost to the Township of less than 95% of the
budgeted cost of the road project, the Township shall refund an
amount equal to the excess budgeted cost over actual cost to the
payors, pro rats, plus accumulated interest.
(3) In the event that the Township fails to commence construction
within three years of the scheduled construction date of the project
as set forth in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan, the
Township shall refund the portion of the fee paid by any payor
making written request therefor which is attributable to said
§ 76-28 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 76-29
1:148
§ 76-30. Effect of fee on other regulations.
This article shall not affect in any manner the permissible use of property,
density of development, previously adopted design and improvement
standards and requirements or any other aspect of the development of land
or provision of public improvements which remain subject to applicable
zoning, subdivision and PRD regulations of the Township, which shall be
operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect
to all such development.
§ 76-31. Fees to be additional and supplemental.
The impact fee is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution
of, any other requirements imposed by the Township on the development of
land or the issuance of building permits. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to alter or affect the Township's existing ordinances and regulations
regarding on-site improvements. In no event shall a property owner be
obligated to pay for transportation capital improvements in an amount in
excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this article; provided, however,
that a property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to Township
ordinances, regulations or policies, for other public facilities in addition to
the impact fee for transportation improvements as specified herein.
§ 76-32. Construal of provisions.
The provisions of this article shall be liberally construed to effectively carry
out its purposes which are hereby found and declared to be furtherance of
the public health, safety, welfare and convenience. Included herein shall be,
project with accumulated interest, provided that no refund shall be
paid with respect to any project actually begun prior to the receipt
of such refund request.
(4) In the event that the development for which impact fees were paid
has not commenced prior to the expiration of the building permit
issued therefor, the impact fees paid with accumulated interest
shall be refunded to the payor upon written request therefor made
within one year from the date of expiration of the applicable
permit. Further, if a building permit after issuance is altered in
such a way as to reduce the indicated impact fee, the difference
between the amount indicated and the amount actually paid shall
be refunded. The payor, at his option, may roll over the impact fees
attributable to an expired building permit to cover fees incurred by
a renewal of said expired permit.
B. With respect to refunds arising out of Subsection A(1) or (2) hereof, any
funds unclaimed within one year after notice as required by law shall be
transferred to the general account of the Township, and the payor's
entitlement to said refund shall lapse. It is the responsibility of the
payor to provide the Township with the current address of his place of
business.

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 82-9. Identification.
§ 82-10. Description and special requirements of Floodplain
Conservation District.
The Floodplain Conservation District shall consist of the following specific
areas/districts:
A. The Floodplain Conservation District shall be any areas of the Township
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated March 2, 2016, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The Floodplain Conservation District shall also include areas with soils
listed in §§ 82-3A(2) and 82-10D.
C. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township and declared to
be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as Floodway
on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS. The
floodway represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial Improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless a permit is obtained from the Department
of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
§ 82-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 82-10
1:177
(1) The AE Area/District adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA and for which base flood elevations have been provided in
the FIS but no floodway has been delineated.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top of bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
C. The A Area/District shall be the areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the elevation shall be determined by using
the elevation of a point on the boundary of the Floodplain Conservation
District which is nearest the construction site.
(1) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. Soils with a frequency of flooding of 1% or greater per year, as
delineated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, United
States Department of Agriculture Web-Based Soil Survey (available
online at http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/), including the following
soils:

§ 82-11. Changes in identification of area.
The Floodplain Conservation District may be revised or modified by the
Board of Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior
to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally,
as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 82-12. Boundary disputes.
§ 82-13. Corporate boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in

A. In the case of any dispute concerning the boundaries of an FP
Floodplain Conservation District, the initial determination shall be
made by the Township Engineer.
B. Any party aggrieved by such decision of the Township Engineer as to
the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District as defined
above, which may include the grounds that the FIRM is or has become
incorrect because of changes due to natural or other causes, or
corrections indicated by additional detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
studies, may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board as provided in
Chapter 153, Article XI, § 153-1107E. The burden of proof shall be on
the applicant.
C. Insofar as changes in various natural conditions, including the
Floodplain Conservation District as herein defined, may change, such
changes may be validated by detailed on-site survey techniques and
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. A determination of
whether or not a proposed use is within the FP Floodplain Conservation
District shall, upon appeal from the decision of the Township Engineer,
be made by the Zoning Hearing Board upon receipt of the findings of
the detailed on-site survey by the applicant. The Board may consider, in
addition to other evidence and standards, the recommendations of the
Planning Commission and the validation of FEMA and/or other
governmental agencies.

Variances
§ 82-19. General.
If compliance with any of the requirements of this chapter would result in
an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or landowner,
the Township may, upon request, grant relief from the strict application of
the requirements.
§ 82-20. Variance procedures.
§ 82-21. Standards for granting variances.
A. Applications for approval of variances in the FP Floodplain
Conservation District shall be considered using the standards listed in
§ 82-21.
B. For a use other than those permitted in § 82-14, an application seeking
approval by variance shall be forwarded to the Zoning Hearing Board
along with required studies or information and the findings of the
Zoning Officer.
C. The Zoning Hearing Board shall request the review and
recommendations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection and the County Conservation District at least 30 days prior
to the public hearing.
D. The Board shall request, at least 30 days prior to the public hearing, the
review and recommendation of the Township Planning Commission and
the Township Engineer.
E. If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification necessary
to provide relief.
F. In rendering a decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary
in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to achieve
the objectives of this chapter.
G. Whenever a variance is granted, the Township shall notify the applicant
in writing that:
(1) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance.
(2) Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
H. A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be
maintained by the Township. In addition, a report of all variances
granted during the year shall be included in the annual report to the
Federal Insurance Administration.
§ 82-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 82-21
1:185
A. No variance shall be granted for any of the uses in § 82-17, Banned
uses.
B. No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the
BFE.
C. No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any portion of the FP Floodplain Conservation District
without a defined floodway that would, together with all other existing
and anticipated development, increase the BFE more than one foot at
any point.
D. The effect of the use shall not substantially alter the cross-section
profile of the stream and floodplains at the location of the proposed use.
E. Lands abutting the waterway, both upstream and downstream, shall not
be adversely affected by the proposed use.
F. The general welfare or public interest of Towamencin Township or of
other municipalities in the same watershed shall not be adversely
affected.
G. Any new construction or improvements to existing structures permitted
by a variance shall be constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer
the minimum obstruction to the flow of water.
H. Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall be
designed and constructed so as to have the capability of resisting the
base flood.
I. In reviewing any request for a variance, the Township shall consider, at
a minimum, the following:
(1) That there is good and sufficient cause.
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the Floodplain
Management Chapter and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
§ 82-21 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 82-21
1:186
§ 82-22. Special requirements for subdivisions.
All subdivision proposals and development proposals containing at least 50
lots or at least five acres, whichever is the lesser, in flood hazard areas
where base flood elevation data are not available, shall be supported by
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses that determine base flood
elevations and floodway information. The analyses shall be prepared by
a licensed professional engineer in a format required by FEMA for a
conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision. Submittal
requirements and processing fees shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(2) That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(3) That the granting of the variance will:
(a) Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense;
(b) Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimize the public or
conflict with any other applicable state or local ordinances and
regulations.

ARTICLE VII
Technical Provisions for Variances
§ 82-23. General.
In granting any variance, the Township shall attach the following technical
provisions to the proposal for which the variance has been granted. These
conditions and safeguards are necessary in order to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the municipality.
A. Pertaining to the alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have been
first obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. The municipality shall require technical or scientific data to be
submitted to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR) within six
months of the completion of any new construction, development, or
other activity resulting in changes in the BFE. The applicant is required
to apply to FEMA for a conditional approval prior to permitting the
encroachments to occur in accordance with 44 CFR 65.12. Upon
conditional approval and prior to approving the proposed
improvements, the Township is required to adopt a revision to the
Floodplain Management Chapter incorporating the increased base
flood elevation and/or revised floodway for post-development
conditions. Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, the
applicant is required to provide as-built certifications to be submitted to
FEMA for the final map revision in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67. A
LOMR or conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is required for:
(1) Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations
within the floodway; or
(2) Any development occurring in Zone A and Zone AE without a
designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than one foot
in the base flood elevation; or
(3) Alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to
installing culverts and bridges).
§ 82-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 82-23
1:189
§ 82-24. Improvements to existing structures in Floodplain
Conservation District.
The following provisions shall apply whenever any improvement is made to
an existing structure located within any Floodplain Conservation District:
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed by
variance within any Floodplain Conservation District shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this

ninety-day period, as selected by the Township from metering facilities data,
divided by the 90 days and 200 gallons per day per EDU and rounded to the
nearest whole number, whichever is greater. All such charges and fees shall
be payable prior to the time final approval is given for the connection to the
sewer system for the total number of EDU connections.
A. For private sewer systems, industrial establishments and nonresidential
users, the currently utilized sewer capacity will be compared to
available records indicating the sewer capacity previously reserved and
paid for. If the current utilized sewer capacity over a calendar year
exceeds the capacity previously reserved, the private sewer system,
industrial establishment and nonresidential user will be required to
either pay the Township the appropriate connection charge and the
Authoritys current capital contribution fee for usage above the
previously reserved quantity within 60 days after being so notified by

the usage still exceeds the capacity previously reserved, the user will be
required to pay the charges and fee stated above.
B. For the sewer facilities not within the Towamencin Township boundary,
the calculated sewage usage shall not exceed the actual reserved
sewage capacity. If this condition exists, the Township shall have the
right to inspect, repair and rehabilitate the system to reduce flow
quantities to acceptable levels. All costs associated with such activities
§ 127-30 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-31

Whenever sewer service to any property begins after March 1, the sewer
rentals for such property shall be for that portion of the annual billing
period during which the property is served. However, in making such
apportionment, a fraction of a month amounting to 1/2 or more of a month
shall be counted as a full month, and a fraction of a month amounting to less
than 1/2 of the month shall be disregarded.
§ 127-38. Collection of delinquent rents; lien.
Delinquent bills for sewer rentals, together with all charges, expenses and
fees added thereto, shall, in the manner provided by law, become a lien upon
the property served and shall be collectible by the Township by an action in
assumpsit against the owner of such property or be enforced against such
property by the filing of a municipal lien.
§ 127-39. Pump station operation and maintenance cost
assessments. [Amended 11-12-2014 by Ord. No. 14-13]

§ 127-52. General discharge prohibitions.
A. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater into the POTW which causes
pass-through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all
such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other national, state or
local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not
contribute the following substances to any POTW: [Amended
8-13-2008 by Ord. No. 08-04]
(1) Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction
with other substances, to cause fire or explosion, including but not
limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flash point of less than
140° F. (60° C.) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR, 261.21,
or which are, or may be, injurious in any other way to the POTW or
to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive
readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge
into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than 5% nor
any single reading be over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of
the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to,
gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers,
alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates,
bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides, and any other
substances which the Township, the Authority, the state or EPA has
notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.

F.) at the point of discharge to the sewer system.
(10) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW. In no case shall a
slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes
more than five times the average twenty-four-hour concentration,
quantities, or flow during normal operation.
(11) Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such halflife or concentration in accordance with applicable state
or federal regulations.
(12) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.

any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, the Authority shall:
(1) Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and
(2) Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW.
A. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment
standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard,
if more stringent than limitations imposed under this Part 2 for sources
in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations
imposed under this Part 2. The Authority shall notify all affected users
of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.

§ 127-56. Right of revision.
The Township or Authority reserves the right to establish more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal
system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in
§ 127-49 of this Part 2, or as required by the United States EPA.
§ 127-57. Excessive discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutantspecific
limitation developed by the Township, Authority, or state.
§ 127-58. Accidental discharges.
A. Accidental and/or problem discharges. Each user shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this Part 2 and from discharges that could
cause problems to the operations of the POTW, including any slug
loadings. Facilities to prevent accidental or problem discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or
user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to
the Authority for review by the Authority before construction of the
facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan when designated
by the Authority. No user who commences contribution to the POTW
after the effective date of this Part 2 shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental and/or problem discharge
procedures have been provided to the Authority. Review of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this Part 2. In the case of an accidental or problem
discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone
and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective actions.
B. Written notice. Within five days following an accidental or problem
discharge, the user shall submit to the Authority a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this Part 2 or other applicable law.
C. Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to

ARTICLE XI
Fees
§ 127-61. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to provide for the recovery of costs from
users of the POTW for the implementation of the program established
herein. The applicable charges or fees shall be established by resolution and
set forth in the Township's or Authority's Schedule of Charges and Fees.92
§ 127-62. Charges and fees.
§ 127-63. Strength surcharge.
A. The charges and fees established by the Township or Authority may
include the following:
(1) Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the
required pretreatment program, including, but not limited to, legal,
engineering, and administrative costs.
(2) Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures;
(3) Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and
construction;
(4) Fees for permit applications;
(5) Fees for filing appeals;
(6) Fees for consistent removal by the POTW of pollutants otherwise
subject to federal pretreatment standards;
(7) Other fees as the Township or Authority may deem necessary to
carry out the requirements contained herein.
B. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this Part 2 and are
separate from all other fees chargeable by the Township and/or the
Authority.
A. The strength of the total wastes used for establishing surcharges shall
be determined on at least one monthly twenty-four-hour composite
sample collected by the Authority or its designated representative.
Additional samples may be required if repeated violations of the local
limits occur.
B. Any nonresidential user discharging waste to the Authority's POTW
with a monthly average BOD concentration greater than 200 milligrams
per liter (mg/l) or COD concentration greater than 400 mg/l and/or
ammonia nitrogen concentration greater than 18.0 mg/l and/or total
phosphorus concentration greater than 5.0 mg/l and/or total suspended
92.Editor's Note: Fees are on file in the Township offices. See also Ch. 76, Fees.
§ 127-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-63
1:311
§ 127-64. Flow surcharge.
solids concentration greater than 150 mg/l, in each case measured at
the source, will pay a strength surcharge in addition to the applicable
volume charge. Such strength surcharge shall be in addition to and
not in substitution for any actions, remedies, or penalties described in
Articles XIII and XIV hereof.
C. The strength surcharge shall be based on the operating costs for the
Authority's POTW during the previous calendar year. A cost per pound
of pollutant shall be determined by dividing the total annual operating
costs, (including general and office, treatment plant and operating
reserve costs) by the total pounds of pollutants (BOD or COD, ammonia
nitrogen, phosphorus and total suspended solids) treated during the
same period. The resultant cost per pound of pollutant is then utilized
to determine the surcharge amount. Strength surcharges are
calculated according to the following general equation:
Surcharge = [(Pollutant concentration - Surcharge limit)
x (Total Billing Period Flow, mg) x 8.34 x (Cost per lb.)]
D. In accordance with § 127-54, unless approved by the Authority in a
compliance schedule contained in the permit conditions as described
under § 127-66D, no industrial user shall, at any time, discharge a
wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the daily maximum limits
established in § 127-54. If a compliance schedule is required, the
industrial user shall develop a schedule and submit this schedule to the
Authority for approval within 30 days of notification by the Authority. If
the industrial user fails to submit a compliance schedule within this
thirty-day period, the Authority shall develop a schedule at the user's
expense. If the user is in violation of or is not making satisfactory
progress in completing the requirements of the compliance schedule
contained in the permit, the Authority shall impose civil penalties as
directed in § 127-76.7.
E. The strength of the total wastes used for establishing surcharges shall
be determined by qualified industrial user discharge monitoring data
and/or on at least one monthly twenty-four-hour composite sample
collected by the Authority or its designated representative. Additional
samples may be required if repeated violations of the local limits occur.
A. The permitted flow is the purchased capacity of the collection system
and the wastewater treatment facility operated by the Authority.
Wastewater discharged in excess of this permitted flow by the
permittee will be cause for a flow surcharge. The basis for this
surcharge is the following:
(1) When the recorded volume or flow of the wastewater exceeds any
of the following stated permit limitations:
(a) Daily maximum flow.
§ 127-63 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-64
1:312
(b) Five-day average flow.
(c) Daily average flow per month.
(d) Six-month total flow.
(2) Each permittee has at least two of the above limitations.
(3) The calculation used for flow surcharges is:
Flow Surcharge = (Recorded/reported flow in gallons - permitted
flow in gallons)
x cost per gallon as reflected in the Discharge Permit
B. Repeated flow surcharge conditions will require the permittee to
purchase additional capacity for the collection system and wastewater
treatment facility at the then-current prescribed rate. Failure to do so in
a timely manner is cause for the permittee to be subject to all of the
enforcement actions available to the Authority.
§ 127-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-64

A. Baseline monitoring reports.
(1) Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to
or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the
Authority a report which contains the information listed in
Subsection A(2), below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of
their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical
industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the Authority a report which
contains the information listed in Subsection A(2), below. A new
source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to
meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give
estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be
discharged.
(2) Users described above shall submit the information set forth below:
§ 127-66 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-67
1:320
(a) All information required in § 127-66B of this Part 2. [See 40
CFR 403.12(b)(1) through (7).]
(b) Measurement of pollutants:
[1] The user shall provide the information in § 127-66B.
[2] The user shall take a minimum of one representative
sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the
requirements of this section.
[3] Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow
use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR
403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit
has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e),
this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the control authority.
[4] Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with Subsection A.
[5] The Authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need
for industrial pretreatment measures.
[6] The baseline report shall indicate time, date, and place of
sampling and method of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
(c) Compliance certification shall include a statement, reviewed
by the user's authorized representative and certified by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment
standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not,
whether additional pretreatment is required to meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(d) If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to
meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by
which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/
or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this
schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
§ 127-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-67
1:321
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in Subsection C of this section.
(e) All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance
with Subsection A(1) of this section and signed by an
authorized representative as defined in § 127-50.
B. Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by Subsection A(2)(d) of this
section:
(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing and completing construction, and
beginning and conducting routine operation);
(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the Authority no later
than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final
compliance including, as a minimum, whether following each date
in the schedule and the final compliance including, as a minimum,
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the
reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by
the user to return to the established schedule; and
(4) In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Authority.
C. Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a
new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards
and requirements shall submit to the Township and/or the Authority a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and
maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which
are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The
report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into
compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified
professional.
D. Periodic compliance reports.
§ 127-67 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-67
1:322
(1) Any user subject to a pretreatment standard after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit
to the Authority during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment
standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily
flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily
flow reported pursuant to Subsection C of this section. If sampling
by the user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation, except if the POTW performs sampling at least
once per month at the user's facility or if the POTW performs
sampling at the user's facility between the time when the user
performs its initial sample and the time the user receives the
results of this sampling. At the discretion of the Authority and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Authority may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted. This
report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user. All wastewater samples must be representative of
the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be property operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user
to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. If a user subject to the reporting
requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently
than required by the Authority, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice
(BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Authority or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine compliance.
(2) The Authority may impose mass or production-based limitations. In
such cases, the report required by Subsection D(1) shall indicate
the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, the flow of the discharge,
the mass of the pollutants discharged which are subject to
applicable pretreatment standards, and, where required by the
Authority discharge permit, production data. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standards. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to Section
304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and
§ 127-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-67
1:323
amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved
by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques approved by the Administrator. (Comment:
Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening
of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical
procedures approved by the Administrator.)
E. Certification statements. All user reports must be signed by an
authorized representative of the user and contain the following
certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather
and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the
person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted
is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and
complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations."
F. Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Authority of
any significant changes to the user's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days
before the change.
(1) The Authority may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed conditions,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application as required in this Part 2.
(2) The Authority may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
or modify an existing permit in response to the changed conditions
or anticipated changed conditions.
G. Reports of potential problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that
might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone the Authority of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user.
§ 127-67 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-67
1:324
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Authority, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage,
or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to
the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
Part 2.
(3) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising the employees who to call in the
event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that
all employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(4) Significant industrial users are required to notify the Authority
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for
a slug discharge.
H. Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the Authority as the Authority may require.
I. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Authority within 30 days after becoming aware of
the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the
Authority performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month,
or if the Authority performs sampling at the user between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or
the Authority receives the results of this sampling, or if the Authority
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
J. Discharge of hazardous waste. The discharge of hazardous wastes, as
described in 40 CFR, Part 261, is prohibited from being discharged into
the POTW.
K. Recordkeeping. Users, subject to the reporting requirements of this
Part 2, shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this Part 2, any additional records of information obtained
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent
of such requirements, and documentation associated with best
management practices established herein. Records shall include the
date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and
§ 127-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-67
1:325
§ 127-68. Monitoring facilities.
§ 127-69. Inspection and sampling.
the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for
a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the
Authority or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Authority.
L. Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines
that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed
by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Authority or other parties approved by EPA.
M. Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been
submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
A. The Township and/or the Authority shall require to be provided and
operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/
or internal drainage systems.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
user.
C. The sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance
with the Authority's requirements and all applicable local construction
standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90
days following written notification by the Township and/or the
Authority.
A. The Township or the Authority shall inspect the facilities of any user to
ascertain whether the purpose of this Part 2 is being met and all
requirements are being compiled with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the
Township and/or the Authority or its representatives ready access at all
times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,
§ 127-67 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-69
1:326
sampling, records examination, and copying, or in the performance of
any of their duties. The Township, the Authority, the approval authority,
and the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of
suitable identification, personnel from the Township, the Authority, the
approval authority, and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without
delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Authority access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this Part 2.
B. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
date obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report. Based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period:
(1) Except as indicated in Subsection B(2) and (3) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Authority, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be
composited in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by
the Authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports required in this Part 2 and 40 CFR
403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab samples must be used
for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data
do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by in § 127-67D [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)],
the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab

samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by and with the
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
A. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this Part 2 and shall achieve compliance with all National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Authority
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Authority for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Authority before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve
the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the Authority under the provisions of
this Part 2. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
Authority prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
B. The Authority shall annually publish in the local newspaper a list of the
users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment
requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months.
The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken
against the user during the same 12 months.
C. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the Authority, EPA or the approval
authority upon request.
A. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the person furnishing a
report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public but shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this Part 2, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal
system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however,
that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or
any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
§ 127-69 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-71
1:328
§ 127-72. Publication of list of users in significant noncompliance.
The Authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation
that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the
POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months,
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall be applicable
to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
Subsection C, D or H of this section) and shall mean:
involving the person furnishing the report. Effluent data will not be
recognized as confidential information.
B. Information accepted by the Authority as confidential shall be
transmitted to any governmental agency immediately when requested,
but not to the general public by the Authority until and unless a ten-day
notification is given to the user.
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in Article X;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard and requirement
including instantaneous limits, as defined by Article X multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for
all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by Article X (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard) that the Authority determines has caused,
alone, or in combination with other discharges interference or passthrough,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the
general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Authority's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-
§ 127-71 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-72
1:329
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the Authority determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.

ARTICLE XIII
Administrative Enforcement Remedies
§ 127-73. Harmful contributions.
§ 127-74. Notice of violation; plan for correction.
When the Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Part 2, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Authority may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
15 days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and
a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Authority.
Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the powers of the Authority to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 127-75. Search warrants.
If the Authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this Part 2, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the Authority designed to verify compliance with this Part 2 or any permit
or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
A. The Authority may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the
Authority, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes
interference to the POTW, or may cause the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.
B. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the permit shall immediately cease wastewater
discharge to the POTW. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Authority shall take such
steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
possible endangerment to any individuals or the environment. The
Authority may reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater treatment
service upon proof, satisfactory to the Authority, of the elimination of
the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by
the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measure taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to
the Authority within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
§ 127-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-75
1:331
and welfare of the community, the Authority may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Court of Common Pleas in Norristown, Pennsylvania.
§ 127-76. Consent orders.
The Authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 127-76.2
and 127-76.3 of this Part 2 and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 127-76.1. Show-cause hearing.
The Authority may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Part 2, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the Authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying
the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the
reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail at least 15 days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative
of the user as defined in § 127-50 and required by § 127-67E. A show-cause
hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
§ 127-76.2. Compliance orders.
When the Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Part 2, an individual wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Authority may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specific time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline
for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
§ 127-75 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 127-76.3
1:332
§ 127-76.3. Cease and desist orders.
When the Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Part 2, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Authority may issue
an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
§ 127-76.4. Termination of discharge.
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance
of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 127-66H of this Part 2, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in Article X of this Part 2.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 127-76.1 of this
Part 2 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.

§ 127-79. Applicability.
From the effective date of this Part 3, its provisions shall apply to all existing
on-site disposal systems, as well as all new systems proposed within the
Township.
§ 127-80. Registration of systems.
§ 127-81. Initial maintenance and inspection activities.
B. All definitions included in Act 537 and the Clean Streams Law97 are
hereby incorporated into this Part 3.
A. All properties which have existing on-site systems shall be registered
with the Township.
B. All new systems shall be required to file a registration form with the
Township and pay the appropriate registration fee prior to the issuance
of a use and occupancy permit for the use of the structure being served
by the on-site system.
A. The Township's authorized agent shall have the right to enter upon all
lands in the Township for the purpose of conducting the inspection
activities outlined herein.
B. The following procedure shall be utilized in pumping and inspecting an
on-lot disposal system utilizing a septic tank as a primary unit. Aerobic
systems may not need to be pumped but shall be inspected by a
qualified person to determine that they are in good working order.
(1) Locate the septic tank and the absorption areas (tile field trenches,
seepage pits, elevated sand mound, etc.).
(2) Locate the septic tank cleanout manhole and excavate around the
cover to prevent soil from falling into the tank when the cover is
removed. The owner shall be responsible to have the cleanout
manhole excavated, whether by the sewage hauler or otherwise.
(3) Remove cleanout manhole cover. Break up scum in the tank and
pump out a portion of the material in the tank. The inspection port
over the baffle shall not be pumped out as this may damage the
baffle and will not permit the tank contents to be thoroughly mixed
for pumping.
(4) Reinject the pumped liquid back into the tank to further break up
the scum and mix the sludge at the bottom of the tank with the
liquid. Pump out the mixed material.
(5) Repeat Subsection B(4) until the tank is pumped out, i.e., sludge
and scum removed.
97.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 127-78 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-81
1:341
(6) Inspect the empty tank for cracks, leaks, deterioration and missing
baffles. The tank shall not be entered for the purpose of inspection.
A mirror and light may be helpful to see inside the tank. Note any
problems with the tank. Acid or chemical cleaner shall not be used
in the tank.
(7) Replace the manhole cover carefully and securely.
(8) If the cleanout manhole is buried deeper than a foot, risers shall be
installed over the cleanout manhole and inspection port to facilitate
future cleaning and inspection. The riser cleanout manhole should
be 24 inches in diameter.
(9) Backfill over the cover or around the riser.
(10) Make a visual inspection of the disposal area for seepage,
breakouts, etc., and note any problems.
(11) Inform the property owner of any problems encountered with any
of the components of the system and, if possible, suggest corrective
measures.
(12) Clean up any spillage. Dispose of the septage at any PADEPapproved
disposal site.
C. The Township's designated agent shall, within 10 days after completing
each inspection required by Subsection B, issue a written report to the
Township and the owner of the property inspected. The report shall
include the findings of the inspection and make recommendations for
the maintenance and/or rehabilitation or repair of the on-site system.
Such recommendations may include requiring the property owner to
retain a private SEO or consultant to further evaluate the system and
develop a program to correct the malfunction. The program to correct
the malfunction may include a proposal to construct a replacement onsite
system, provided that the proposed system meets the requirements
as promulgated by the PADEP.
D. All owners of on-site systems with gray water discharges to the ground
surface shall correct such discharges and route the gray water into the
treatment tank (i.e., septic tank or, if applicable, cesspool or dry well).
The owner shall notify the MCDH SEO when the work is completed, and
the SEO shall inspect the property and file a report with the Township
no earlier than three months and no later than six months from the date
of notification.
E. Any on-lot sewage disposal system may be inspected by the Township's
authorized agent at any reasonable time as of the effective date of this
Part 3. The inspection may include a physical tour of the property; the
taking of samples from surface water, wells and other groundwater
sources; the sampling of the contents of the sewage disposal system
itself; and/or the introduction of a traceable substance into the interior
plumbing of the structure served to ascertain the path and ultimate

system that contains a septic tank, or a cesspool/dry well, shall have the
septic tank or cesspool/dry well pumped by a pumper/hauler at a
minimum of every four years. The septic tank pumping shall be done in
the presence of the Township's SEO. Immediately following this
pumping, the SEO shall inspect the baffles of the septic tank. The
method of this inspection shall be determined by the SEO. This
inspection may require that a portion of the septic tank be exposed. If
excavation is necessary to accomplish the inspection, the excavation
shall be done by the property owner prior to the inspection. If deemed
necessary by the SEO, the distribution box, if one is present, shall be
excavated and remain excavated until inspection has been completed
by the SEO. Receipts from the pumper/hauler shall be submitted by the
property owner or tenant to the Township within 30 days of the receipt
of the invoice from the hauler.
D. The required pumping frequency may be increased at the discretion of
the authorized agent if the septic tank is undersized, if solids buildup in
the tank is above average, if the hydraulic load on the system increases
significantly above average, if a garbage grinder is used in the building,
if the system malfunctions or for other good cause shown. In addition,
§ 127-81 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 127-82

found to be in good working order. Any person whose septic tank baffles
are determined to require repair or replacement shall first contact the
MCDH SEO for approval of the necessary repair.
F. Any person owning a building served by an on-site sewage disposal
system which contains an aerobic treatment tank shall follow the
operation and maintenance recommendations of the equipment
manufacturer. A copy of the manufacturer's recommendations and a
copy of the service agreement shall be submitted to and remain on file
with the Township and MCDH. Thereafter, service receipts shall be
submitted to the Township at the intervals specified by the
manufacturer's recommendations. In no case may the service or
pumping intervals for aerobic treatment tanks exceed those required
for septic tanks.
G. Any person owning a building utilizing a cesspool or dry well which is
the receiving unit for solids shall have that system pumped according to
the schedule prescribed for septic tanks. As an alternative to this
scheduled pumping of the cesspool or dry well, the owner may secure a
sewage permit from the MCDH SEO for a septic tank to be installed
preceding the cesspool or dry well. For a system consisting of a
cesspool or dry well preceded by an approved septic tank, only the
septic tank must be pumped at the prescribed interval.
H. The Township may require additional maintenance activity as needed,
including but not necessarily limited to cleaning and unclogging of
piping; servicing and repair of mechanical equipment; leveling of
distribution boxes, tanks and lines; removal of obstructing roots or
trees; and the diversion of surface water away from the disposal area,
etc.
A. Should the MCDH SEO, or the independent SEO/consultant retained by
the property owner, with the approval of the MCDH, indicate that it is
not possible to repair or modify the system to comply with the
Department's standards for on-site sewage disposal systems, then the
property owner shall be required to have a replacement on-site sewage
disposal system designed for the property. Said design shall conform to

existing disposal area, replacing a gravity distribution system with a
pressurized system or other alternatives as appropriate for the specific
site, including use of the reservation areas as required for new systems
in § 127-86G of this Part 3.
C. In lieu of or in combination with the remedies described in Subsection
B, the MCDH SEO may require the installation of water conservation
equipment and the institution of water conservation practices in
structures served. Water-using devices and appliances in the structure
may be required to be retrofitted with water-saving appurtenances, or
they may be required to be replaced by water-conserving devices and
appliances. Wastewater generation in the structure may also be
reduced by requiring changes in water usage patterns in the structure
served. The use of laundry facilities may be limited to one load per day
or discontinued altogether.
D. Should none of the repair, rehabilitation or replacement efforts
described herein be totally effective in eliminating the malfunction of
an existing on-site sewage disposal system, the property owner shall be
required to install a sealed holding tank. This holding tank shall be
sized by the MCDH SEO. The property owner shall have the holding
tank pumped out as required under § 127-82G.
E. Should none of the repair or rehabilitation efforts described herein be
totally effective in eliminating the malfunction of an existing on-site
sewage disposal system, a property owner whose property abuts or
fronts an existing public sewer shall be required to connect to said
public sewer at the property owner's sole expense.
F. Should more than 50% of the property owners in a particular drainage
area, as set forth in Exhibit A,98 petition the Board of Supervisors to
install public sewers, then the Board may authorize the design of the
public sewer system which shall be dependent upon the location of the
drainage area and its proximity to any existing public sanitary sewers.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 132-1. Findings.
The Board of Supervisors of Towamencin Township, Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout the Township increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development, activities causing accelerated
erosion, and connections and discharges to the municipal separate
storm sewer system is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require the Township to implement a
program of stormwater controls. The Township is required to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from its separate storm sewer system
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a prohibition
of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated small
municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s).
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of surface waters of the commonwealth by
the Township.
§ 132-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-2
1:357
§ 132-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management
§ 132-11. General requirements.
A. All regulated activities in the Township which do not fall under the
exemption criteria shown in § 132-5 shall submit a drainage plan
consistent with this chapter to the Township for review. These criteria
shall apply to the total proposed development even if development is to
take place in stages. The starting point from which to consider tracts as
parent tracts is February 25, 2004. All impervious surface area
constructed on or after February 25, 2004, shall be considered
cumulatively. Impervious surface area existing on the parent tract prior
to this date shall not be considered in cumulative impervious surface
area calculations for determining exemption applicability. No regulated
activities shall commence until the Township issues written approval of
a drainage plan, demonstrating compliance with the requirements of
this chapter, or issues a building or zoning permit where a proposed
activity is exempt from the requirements of this chapter related to
preparation of a drainage plan.
B. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this
chapter and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania
Code and the Clean Streams Law.110 Various BMPs and their design
standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual (E&S Manual) dated March 2012, as amended and
updated.
C. All regulated activities shall be designed in a manner to protect health,
safety, and property and meet water quality goals of this chapter by
minimizing disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded areas,
maintaining or extending riparian buffers, preventing erosive flow
conditions in natural flow pathways, minimizing thermal impacts to
surface waters of the commonwealth, and by disconnecting impervious
surfaces by directing stormwater runoff over pervious areas wherever
possible. Stormwater management facilities/BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained with all regulated activities to
meet the purposes and requirements of this chapter and to meet all
requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean
Streams Law, and the Storm Water Management Act.111
D. To the maximum extent practicable, all regulated activities shall be
designed in a manner to incorporate techniques for low impact
development practices described in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual.

111. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 132-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-11
1:377
E. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities, stormwater BMPs or open channels
consistent with this chapter.
F. The existing points of concentrated drainage flow that discharge onto
an adjacent downstream property shall not be altered without written
consent of the affected property owner(s) in the form of a drainage
easement. The Township Engineer shall determine the length and width
of the drainage easement as well as the extent of the properties from
which written consent must be obtained by the developer or applicant.
An increase in runoff shall be subject to review for the effect of
increased flow rate and velocity on the downstream receiving
stormwater facilities to evaluate the potential for flooding and erosion.
The applicant must provide supporting calculations showing a "no
harm" condition relative to the same prior to approval by the Township
Engineer.
G. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge. The developer shall provide documentation indicating that
permission has been obtained from the affected downstream property
owner(s) for the purpose of discharging formerly diffused flow in a
concentrated manner onto the property owner's property and/or
improving the downstream off-site stormwater facilities as directed by
the Township Engineer.
H. Stormwater runoff peak rate control.
(1) In the design of stormwater management facilities,
postdevelopment rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall
not exceed 75% of the peak rates of runoff prior to development for
two- and ten-year-frequency storms and 100% of the peak rates of
runoff prior to development for the twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year frequency storms. In all other cases where
unretained stormwater directly discharges from the site by
bypassing the stormwater management facilities, the
postdevelopment runoff rate shall not exceed the predevelopment
runoff rate.
(2) For all regulated activities within the Township, the tributary area
discharging drainage to any location along the site property
boundary shall not increase by more than 25% over the
predevelopment condition without written approval from the
§ 132-11 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-11
1:378
adjacent affected property owner(s). The preceding requirements
shall apply to each location of concentrated or diffused drainage
discharge from the development site.
(3) For redevelopment sites, one of the following minimum design
parameters shall be accomplished, whichever is most appropriate
for the given site conditions as determined by the Township
Engineer:
(a) Conform to the full requirements of this chapter.
(b) Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20%
based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface area
to proposed impervious surface area.
(4) For all regulated activities within the Neshaminy Creek Watershed,
postdevelopment rates of runoff shall not exceed those peak rates
identified in Appendix 132F of this chapter.
I. Where the area of a site being impacted by a proposed development
activity not associated with a subdivision or land development differs
significantly from the total site area, only the proposed disturbed area
and other areas compacted due to construction activity shall be subject
to the peak release rate criteria of § 132-11H. The postdevelopment
runoff rate from unimpacted or undisturbed areas that do not flow into
or are bypassing the stormwater management facilities shall not exceed
the predevelopment runoff rate.
J. Whenever a watercourse is located within a development site, it shall
remain open in the natural state and location and shall not be piped,
impeded, or altered (except for road crossings), and drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, the removal of trees/vegetation, and any
alterations that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any
portion of the easement. The width of the easement shall be defined as
the Riparian Corridor Zone 1 limits, a minimum of 25 feet wide,
measured horizontally on both sides from the top of the bank of the
identified watercourse. Also, the property owner shall be responsible
for maintenance of vegetation within the easement as governed by the
requirements referenced under the definition of the riparian corridor.
For all subdivisions and land developments, the developer shall
stabilize all eroded stream/channel beds and banks and obtain all
permits necessary from PADEP to do so. The developer must submit
pictorial documentation of existing stream/channel banks to determine
whether existing banks must be stabilized.
K. For all regulated activities proposed in conjunction with a subdivision
and land development, whether or not those disturbance activities are
adjacent to a watercourse, sediment-reducing best management
practices (BMPs) must be provided to the watercourse in a manner
approved by the Township Engineer. Calculations must be included with
§ 132-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-11
1:379
the subdivision and land development application which document the
amount of sediment expected to be removed from the watercourse on a
yearly basis (as defined pursuant to the Pennsylvania BMP Manual) as
a result of the proposed BMPs.
L. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval of the Township Engineer and by PADEP
through the Joint U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/PADEP Stream
Encroachment application or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP,
through the general permit process.
M. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth
or wetlands shall be subject to approval by PADEP through the joint
permit application process or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP, the
general permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands
may be involved, it is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to
show that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands;
otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained from PADEP.
N. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
O. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are required, where soil
conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need for detention
facilities. Soil conditions that are not considered suitable are identified
in § 132-12. Sinkhole-prone areas where karst bedrock exists and steep
slope areas as defined by Towamencin Township Code, Chapter 153,
Zoning, are not considered suitable for infiltration BMPs.
P. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and be located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features
while still meeting the other requirements of this chapter. As a selection
guide and design references for developing these methods, the
applicants' designers should use the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual.
Q. Roof drains must not be connected to streets or sanitary sewers. They
should be connected to storm sewers or roadside ditches only when
necessary and only when they discharge to infiltration or vegetative
stormwater BMPs. Infiltration/percolation of stormwater should be
provided by the means of dry wells, seepage or infiltration pits where
conditions permit.

(a) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows any nonstormwater discharge,
including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water, to
enter the regulated small MS4 or the surface waters of the
commonwealth, and any connections to the storm drain system
from indoor waste water drains and sinks; and
(b) Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the regulated small MS4 which has not
been documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records, and
approved by the Township.
S. Hot spots.
(1) Hot spots are sites where the land use or activity produces a higher
concentration of trace metals, hydrocarbons, or priority pollutants
than normally found in urban runoff. Use of infiltration BMPs is
prohibited on hot spot land use areas. Examples of hot spots
include but are not limited to the following:
(a) Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities.
(b) Vehicle fueling stations.
(c) Vehicle service and maintenance facilities.
(d) Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities.
(e) Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.).
(f) Industrial sites (based on Standard Industrial Codes defined by
the U.S. Department of Labor).
(g) Marinas (service and maintenance).
(h) Outdoor liquid container storage.
(i) Outdoor loading/unloading facilities.
(j) Public works storage areas.
(k) Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
(l) Commercial container nursery.

§ 132-12. Volume controls, water quality requirements, and
infiltration BMPs.
(m) Other land uses and activities as designated by the Township.
(2) Stormwater runoff from hot spot land uses shall be pretreated. In
no case may the same BMP be employed consecutively to meet this
requirement. Guidance regarding acceptable methods of
pretreatment is located in The Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual.
T. Additional stormwater management criteria applicable to properties
within the Neshaminy Creek Watershed. For regulated activities within
the Neshaminy Creek Watershed, the additional stormwater
management provisions identified in Appendix 132F of this chapter
shall be applicable.
U. Regulated activities requiring a drainage permit must comply with the
environmental performance standards of the Towamencin Township
Code, Chapter 153, Article VI, § 153-616.
A. For all regulated activities not exempt from preparation and submission
of a drainage plan pursuant to § 132-5 of this chapter, water volume
controls shall be implemented. Postdevelopment total runoff volume
shall not be increased from predevelopment total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation. The Design Storm Method, which requires detailed
stormwater runoff modeling based on site conditions, shall be utilized
to calculate the volume of runoff that must either be reused,
evapotranspired, or infiltrated through structural or nonstructural
means. Water volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts,
protect stream channel morphology, maintain groundwater recharge,
and contribute to water quality improvements. The low impact
development practices provided in the Pennsylvania BMP Manual shall
be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent
practicable. For regulated activities within the Neshaminy Creek
Watershed, the volume control criteria identified in Appendix 132F112 of
this chapter shall be applicable.
B. The applicant must demonstrate how the required volume is controlled
through stormwater best management practices (BMPs) which shall
provide the means necessary to capture, reuse, evaporate, transpire or
infiltrate the total runoff volume.
C. Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall
be selected based on the suitability of soils and site conditions.
Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
112. Editor's Note: Appendix 132F is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 132-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-12
1:383
(1) A minimum soil depth of 18 inches between the bottom of the
infiltration BMPs and the top of bedrock or seasonally high water
table (i.e., "limiting zone"). The minimum required separation
between the limiting zone may be increased, if required by the
Township, should project specific conditions exist (such as
anticipated increased contaminants) which dictate greater
prevention of groundwater contamination.
(2) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater
load and dewater completely as determined by field tests. The
minimum acceptable infiltration rate for field-tested soils shall be
0.2 inches/hour (in/hr). A safety factor of 50% shall be applied to
field-tested infiltration rates to determine the rate to be utilized for
design purposes (e.g., for soil which measured 0.4 in/hr in the field,
the BMP design shall use 0.2 in/hr to insure safe infiltration rates
after construction).
(3) All infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely infiltrate
runoff volume within two days (48 hours) from the peak of the
design storm.
(4) When infiltration methods such as seepage pits, beds, or trenches
are proposed, the locations of existing and proposed septic tanks,
infiltration areas, and wells must be shown. A separation distance
of no less than 20 feet shall be provided between any septic system
and any facility used for stormwater management and infiltration.
(5) A minimum of 30 feet of undisturbed soil shall separate the
foundation wall of any building and an infiltration BMP.
(6) The infiltration system shall have positive overflow controls to
prevent storage within one foot of the finished surface of grade.
(7) Surface inflows shall be designed to prevent direct discharge of
sediment into the infiltration system.
(8) Special attention shall be paid to proper installation of infiltrationoriented
stormwater management systems during the construction
and to careful avoidance of soil compaction during site
development. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be
protected from sedimentation and compaction during the
construction phase, so as to maintain their maximum infiltration
capacity.
(9) Caution shall be exercised where salt or chloride would be a
pollutant since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may
contaminate the groundwater. The qualified design professional
shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater contamination from
the proposed infiltration/recharge facility if it is anticipated that
such pollutants or similar pollutants may enter the facility.
§ 132-12 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-12
1:384
(10) The drainage plan must include safeguards against groundwater
contamination for uses which may cause groundwater
contamination, should there be a mishap or spill. The Township
may require the installation of a mitigative layer or an impermeable
liner in the BMP and/or detention basins where the possibility of
groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic
investigation may be required by the Township. If impermeable
liner or other containment measures are required to prevent
contaminated runoff from infiltrating into the ground, additional
measures conforming to the requirements of this chapter must be
implemented to improve the quality of stormwater runoff from the
development site.
(11) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
achieved final stabilization.
(12) The requirements for volume control and infiltration are applied to
all disturbed areas, even if they are ultimately to be a pervious or
permeable land use given the extent to which development-related
disturbance leads to compaction of the soils and reduces their
infiltrative capacity.
D. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to determine the
suitability of infiltration facilities. All applicants proposing regulated
activities that are not exempt from preparation and submission of a
drainage plan pursuant to § 132-5 of this chapter are required to
perform a detailed soils evaluation by a qualified geotechnical engineer,
geologist and/or soil scientist, in accordance with Appendix 132C113 of
this chapter, which at a minimum addresses soil permeability, depth to
bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability.
The general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(1) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of
subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface)
to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration BMP based on field-determined capacity at
the level of the proposed infiltration surface and based on the
safety factor of 50%.

§ 132-13. Design and construction criteria for stormwater
management facilities; best management practices.
(4) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be
demonstrated that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots
identified.
A. Stormwater runoff which may result from regulated activities identified
in § 132-4 shall be controlled by permanent stormwater runoff BMPs
that will provide the required standards within Article III. The methods
of stormwater control or best management practices (BMPs) which may
be used to meet the required standards are described in this chapter
and the "Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practice Manual,"
December 30, 2006, as amended. The choice of BMPs is not limited to
the ones appearing in this chapter and the manual; however, any
selected BMP must meet or exceed the runoff peak rate requirements of
this chapter.
B. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
C. Collection system standards.
(1) Curb inlets. Curb inlets shall be located at curb tangents on the
uphill side of street intersections, and at intervals along the
curbline to control the maximum amount of encroachment of runoff
on the roadway pavement so that same does not exceed a width of
four feet during the design storm event. Design and location of
curb inlets shall be approved by the Township.
(2) Pipe materials. All storm sewer piping shall be Class III reinforced
concrete pipe, except when pipe class and strength is required to
be increased in accordance with PennDOT specifications. Piping
shall be saw-cut at ends, as needed, and not hammered or broken.
All pipe joints and lift holes must be mortared except where
designed for infiltration.
(3) Minimum pipe size. Minimum pipe diameter shall be 15 inches (or
an equivalent flow area of 1.23 square feet).
(4) Inlet and manhole construction. Inlet and manhole castings and
concrete construction shall be equivalent to PennDOT design
standards. Manhole castings and covers shall have the word
"STORM" cast in two-inch-high letters on the top of the cover. All
inlet grates shall be "bicycle safe" heavy-duty structural steel. All
storm sewer inlets must be identified with a storm drain marker
("environmental" type). Storm drain markers shall be stainless
steel affixed to the inlet hood with adhesive, rivets or bolts.
(Markers may be bolted to the grate in off-road locations). Markers
shall have a minimum diameter of 3 1/2 inches and include "No
§ 132-12 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:386
Dumping - Drains to Waterway" and a fish symbol. Alternate
designs/sizes may be used if approved by the Township.
(5) Open-end pipes must be fitted with concrete endwalls or wing walls
in accordance with PennDOT standards.
(6) Flow velocity. Stormwater collection systems shall be designed to
produce a minimum velocity of three feet per second when flowing
full. The maximum permissible velocity shall be 15 feet per second.
Pipe slopes shall not be less than 1/2 of 1% (0.005 ft/ft), with the
exception that terminal sections of pipe shall have a minimum slope
of 1% (0.01 ft/ft).
(7) Inlets and manholes shall be spaced at intervals not exceeding 300
feet, and shall be located wherever branches are connected or sizes
are changed, and wherever there is a change in alignment or
grade. For drainage lines of at least 36 inches diameter, inlets and
manholes may be spaced at intervals of 400 feet. Manholes shall be
equipped with open-grate lids.
(8) Stormwater collection facilities shall be designed and constructed
to intercept concentrated runoff prior to discharge over public/
private rights-of-way, sidewalks, streets, and driveways.
(9) The capacity of all Type "C" inlets shall be based on a maximum
surface flow to the inlets of four cfs, calculated based on the onehundred-
year-frequency design storm event. If the surface flow to
an inlet exceeds four cfs, additional inlets shall be provided
upstream of the inlet to intercept the excessive surface flow. The
maximum flow to Type "C" inlets located in low points (such as sag
vertical curves) shall include the overland flow directed to the inlet
as well as all bypass runoff from upstream inlets. The bypass flow
from upstream inlets shall be calculated using inlet efficiency
curves included in PennDOT Design Manual Part 2, latest edition. A
Type "C" inlet at a low point of a paved area may be designed to
accept a maximum of six cubic feet per second (cfs). Type "M"
inlets shall be designed to accept a maximum surface flow of six cfs
based on the one-hundred-year-frequency design storm event,
unless otherwise approved by the Township. Double inlets will not
be permitted where additional pipe and inlets can be placed
upstream to intercept excessive surface flow. A maximum of 12 cfs
shall be permitted to be collected by a Type "M" inlet located in an
isolated pervious area, provided the designer can verify that such
an inlet would not cause stormwater to accumulate on any
adjoining public or private property, outside of a storm sewer
easement, and that the depth of the accumulated stormwater
would not exceed 12 inches.
(10) A minimum drop of two inches shall be provided between the inlet
and outlet pipe invert elevations within all inlets and manholes.
When varying pipe sizes enter an inlet or manhole, the elevation of
§ 132-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-13
1:387
crown of all pipes shall be matched. Storm sewer pipes shall enter
and exit the sides of inlet boxes and shall not encroach into the
corner, wherever possible.
(11) Stormwater pipes shall have a minimum depth of cover of 18 inches
(including over the bell) or as designated by the American Concrete
Pipe Association (whichever is greater), and in no case shall any
part of the pipe project into the road subbase or curb. Where cover
is restricted, equivalent pipe arches may be specified in lieu of
circular pipe, to achieve required cover. Stormwater pipes
conveying swale flow under driveway crossings shall have a
minimum cover of 12 inches, including over the bell, but in no case
shall the cover be less than that required for the anticipated traffic
loading. For driveway culverts, cover may be less than 12 inches if
the design engineer verifies such pipe has sufficient strength for
the anticipated vehicle loading. Where cover is restricted, concrete
trench drain with bolt-down metal grate may be used.
(12) The capacity of all stormwater pipes shall be calculated utilizing
the Manning Equation for open channel flow as applied to closed
conduit flow. The Manning's roughness coefficient shall be 0.13 for
all concrete pipe. In cases where pressure flow may occur, the
hydraulic grade line shall be calculated throughout the storm
sewer system to verify that at least one foot of freeboard will be
provided in all inlets and manholes for the design storm event.
(13) Culverts shall be designed based on procedures contained in
Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts, HDS #5, U.S. Department
of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Where
pressure flow is anticipated in storm sewer pipes (non-open
channel flow), the applicant's designer shall be required to
calculate the elevation of the hydraulic grade line through the
storm sewer system. Wherever the hydraulic grade line elevation
exceeds the pipe crown elevation for the design flow, pipes with
watertight joints must be specified.
(14) Storm sewer structures (e.g., endwalls, inlets, pipe sections, etc.)
may not be located on top of or within 10 feet of electric,
communication, water, sanitary sewer, or gas services and/or mains
and structures, unless approval is received from the Township and
the authority or utility having jurisdiction over same.
(15) Stormwater pipes must be oriented at right angles to electric,
water, sanitary sewer, and gas utilities when crossing above or
beneath same. Crossing angles of less than 90° will only be
permitted at the discretion of the Township. When skewed
crossings are permitted, interior angles between alignment of the
storm sewer pipe and utility may not be less than 45°. Vertical and
horizontal design of storm sewers must be linear.
§ 132-13 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:388
(16) Roadway underdrain is required along both sides of all proposed
roadways, existing roadways proposed to be widened, and within
existing or proposed roadside swales as directed by the Township.
(17) Where a public storm sewer system is not located within a right-ofway
or dedicated public property, a twenty-foot-wide easement
shall be established to encompass the storm sewer system. For
multiple pipes or utilities, the width of the easement shall be a
minimum of 30 feet.
(18) A minimum of one foot of freeboard, between the inlet grate and
the design flow elevation, shall be provided in all storm sewer
systems (inlets and manholes) for the one-hundred-year-frequency
design storm event.
(19) Stormwater roof drains and sump pumps shall not discharge water
directly onto a sidewalk or a street and shall be constructed to
discharge to a dry well/seepage pit or above ground entirely on the
subject property, except where such discharge could flow across a
sidewalk or onto a street. If approved by the Township Engineer,
roof drains and sump pumps may be discharged directly to a storm
sewer system if such system discharges to a stormwater BMP or
water quality facility.
D. Open swales and gutters. Open swales shall be designed on the basis of
Manning's Formula as indicated for collection systems with the
following considerations:
(1) Roughness coefficient. The roughness coefficient shall be 0.040 for
earth swales.
(2) Bank slopes. Slopes for swale banks shall not be steeper than one
vertical to four horizontal.
(3) Flow velocity. The maximum velocity of flow as determined by
Manning's Equation shall not exceed the allowable velocities as
shown in the following table for the specific type of material, unless
otherwise approved by the Township and the Montgomery County
Conservation District. (NOTE: The source of the following design
criteria is the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation Publication,

matting to permit establishment of permanent vegetation. Swales
shall be of such shape and size to effectively contain the onehundred-
year, Rational Method design storm, or greater, and to
conform to all other specifications of the Township.
(5) To minimize sheet flow of stormwater across lots located on the
lower side of roads or streets, and to divert flow away from building
areas, the cross-section of the street as constructed shall provide
for parallel ditches or swales or curb on the lower side which shall
discharge only at drainage easements, unless otherwise approved
by the Township.
(6) Gutters and swales adjacent to road paving shall be permitted to
carry a maximum flow of four cubic feet per second prior to
discharge away from the street surface, unless it is proven to the
satisfaction of the Township by engineering calculations that the
road slopes or other factors would allow higher gutter or swale
capacity.
(7) Flows larger than those permitted in gutters and roadside swales
may be conveyed in swales outside the required road right-of-way
in separate drainage easements, or may be conveyed in pipes or
culverts inside or outside the required road right-of-way.
§ 132-13 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:390
(8) Existing and proposed swales shall be provided with underdrains
as deemed necessary by the Township should overland seepage
result in potential maintenance problems. Underdrains must
discharge into a natural drainage channel or stormwater
management system.
(9) Where drainage swales are used to divert surface waters away
from buildings, they shall be sodded, landscaped, or otherwise
protected as required and shall be of a slope, shape, and size
conforming with the requirements of the Township. Concentration
of surface water runoff shall be permitted only in swales,
watercourses, retention or detention basins, bioretention areas, or
other areas designed to meet the objectives of this chapter.
E. Bridge and culvert design. Any proposed bridge or culvert to convey
flow within a watercourse, perennial stream, intermittent stream or
ephemeral stream shall be designed in accordance with the following
principals:
(1) Culverts and bridges shall be designed with an open bottom to
maintain natural sediment transport and bed roughness, avoiding
acceleration of water velocity above the natural (preexisting)
condition. Rock (rip rap) lining (native material if possible) shall be
installed within the culvert as needed to prevent erosion within the
structure. Approximate top of rock lining must be at the level of the
existing stream bottom so as to maintain normal water level and
unimpeded movement of native animal species.
(2) The bottom of the opening shall be designed to match the bankfull
channel condition in terms of width and depth. The cross-sectional
area of the bankfull channel (measured at a reference location
upstream of the structure) shall be matched with area in the
crossing structure.
(3) Above the bankfull elevation, the width shall increase a minimum of
30% to disperse the energy of higher flow volumes and avoid
undermining of the supporting structure by secondary currents.
(4) The total cross-sectional area of the structure opening must be
equal to or greater than the flood-prone area (cross-sectional
stream area at a depth of twice the maximum bankfull depth,
measured at a reference location upstream of the structure). The
flood-prone area is approximately equal to the area flooded by a
fifty-year return flood.
(5) All bridges, culverts, and drainage channels shall be designed to
convey a flow rate equal to a one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
storm as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service, Technical Release No. 55. All bridges and
culverts shall be designed to convey the one-hundred-year design
storm without increasing the extent and depth of the one-hundredyear
floodplain.
§ 132-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-13
1:391
F. Storm sewer design.
(1) Design flow rate.
(a) The storm sewer system shall be designed to carry the onehundred-
year frequency design storm peak flow rate. The
drainage area and runoff coefficient to each inlet shall be
indicated on the stormwater management plan. The onehundred-
year flow rate shall be determined by the Rational
Method formula, Q = CIA, where:
Q = Peak runoff rate measured in cubic feet per second
(cfs).
C = Runoff coefficient. The coefficient of stormwater
runoff includes many variables, such as ground slope,
ground cover, shape of drainage area, etc.
I = Intensity: average rainfall intensity in inches per hour
for a time equal to the time of concentration.
A = Area: drainage area in acres.
(b) Values for the rainfall intensity shall be based on NOAA Atlas
14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, rain data found in Table B-2 and
Figure B-2 of Appendix 132B of this chapter.114
(2) Consideration shall be given to future land use changes in the
drainage area in selecting the Rational ("C") coefficient. For
drainage areas containing several different types of ground cover, a
weighted value of "C" shall be used.
(3) In determining the peak flow rate to individual storm sewer inlets
(or other collection structures) the time of concentration method
(as referenced in § 132-14) shall be used for inlet drainage areas in
excess of one acre, unless otherwise approved by the Township. For
inlet drainage areas less than one acre, a five-minute time of
concentration shall be used unless otherwise approved by the
Township.
(4) In determining the required design flow rate through a storm
sewer piping system, if a five-minute time of concentration results
in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches (or equivalent flow area of 4.9
square feet), within any run of pipe, the time of concentration
approach may be used for sizing of pipes from that point on, by
adjusting the time of concentration.
(5) Overflow system. An overflow system shall be provided to carry all
bypass flow and/or flow in excess of storm sewer design capacity to
the detention basin (or other approved outlet point) when the
capacity of the storm sewer system is exceeded. Stormwater runoff
will not be permitted to surcharge from storm sewer structures.

§ 132-13 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:392
G. Grading and drainage.
(1) After completion of rough grading, a minimum of six inches of
topsoil shall be returned to remaining disturbed areas prior to final
grading and seeding.
(2) Lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage away from buildings
and to prevent the collection of stormwater in pools. Minimum 2%
slopes shall be maintained away from and around all structures.
Separation between the top of foundation wall (or slab) and final
grade shall comply with Township Building Code requirements.
(3) Construction. The developer shall construct and/or install such
drainage structures and/or pipe which are necessary to prevent
erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off such surface waters
to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse.
(4) Excavation. No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in
slope than four horizontal to one vertical (4:1 = 25%), except under
one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope of steeper than 4:1, and a written
statement (certification) from a professional civil engineer,
licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
experienced in erosion control, to this effect is submitted to the
Township Engineer for review. This statement shall indicate
the site has been inspected and that the deviation from the
slope specified herein will not result in injury to persons or
damage to property.
(b) A concrete, segmental block, or stone masonry wall,
constructed in accordance with Township requirements, is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
(5) Fill. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than four horizontal to one vertical (4:1 = 25%),
except under one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The fill is located so that settlement, sliding, or erosion will not
result in property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property,
streets, alleys, or buildings.
(b) A written statement from a professional civil engineer, licensed
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in
erosion control, certifying the site has been inspected and that
the proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage, is
submitted to and approved by the Township.
§ 132-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-13
1:393
(c) A concrete, segmental block, or stone masonry wall,
constructed in accordance with Township requirements, is
provided to support the face of the fill.
(6) Slopes and fences. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a
minimum of five feet from property or right-of-way lines of streets
or alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without
encroaching on the abutting property. A protective fence shall be
required at the top of the wall (or embankment), pursuant to the
requirements of the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code,
where walls or slopes (steeper than two horizontal to one vertical)
are approved under the criteria in this chapter.
(7) Cleanup. All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances
whatsoever during construction.
(8) Design of erosion and sedimentation control facilities (particularly
stormwater/sediment basins) shall incorporate best management
practices as defined herein.
(9) Cut and fill operations shall be kept to a minimum. Wherever
feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and
supplemented. Cut and fills shall not endanger or otherwise
adversely impact adjoining property.
(10)No grading equipment shall be permitted to be loaded and/or
unloaded on a public street, and no grading equipment shall be
permitted to travel on or across a public street unless licensed for
operation on public thoroughfares.
(11) Grading equipment shall not be permitted to cross intermittent and
perennial streams. Temporary crossing shall only be permitted
where application is made, and approval is received, from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (where
applicable), the Montgomery County Conservation District, and
Towamencin Township.
(12) Design of energy dissipation for high-volume and/or high-velocity
discharge from storm sewer pipes and channels shall be in
accordance with Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 14,
"Hydraulic Design of Energy Dissipaters for Culverts and
Channels," as published by the Department of Transportation,
FHA, when deemed necessary by the Township, and as approved by
the Montgomery County Conservation District.
(13) To control the dissemination of mud and dirt onto public roads and
driveways, tire cleaning areas constructed of AASHTO #1 stone
(underlain by geotextile structural fabric) and conforming to
PADEP standards shall be installed at each point of access to the
site and individual lots (upon construction of internal streets in a
binder condition). When deemed necessary by the Township,
washing stations shall also be set up at every construction entrance
§ 132-13 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:394
in order to wash mud and dirt from exiting vehicles. Appropriate
measures must be taken to control runoff from such locations. The
developer shall be responsible for the placement of appropriate
signage identifying construction entrances and washing stations.
Construction entrances shall be maintained by the developer
during construction, as determined by the Township.
(14) In the event any mud and/or debris is transported from the site
onto a public roadway, the debris shall be removed immediately
and the roadway swept and/or washed as deemed necessary by the
Township at the owner's expense.
(15) Adequate provision shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavation and the sloping surfaces of
fills.
H. Stormwater detention/retention basins.
(1) If permanent ponds (retention basins) are proposed, the developer
shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed to protect the
public's health and safety. Should any stormwater management
facility require a dam safety permit under the PADEP Chapter 105
regulations, the facility shall be designed in accordance with
Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning
dam safety which may be required to pass storms larger than a onehundred-
year event.
(2) During construction, duly authorized representatives of
Towamencin Township may enter at any reasonable time upon any
property within the Township to investigate whether construction
activity is in compliance with this chapter.
(3) When basins are provided, they shall be designed to utilize the
natural contours of the land whenever possible. When such design
is not practical, the construction of the basin shall utilize slopes as
flat as possible to blend the structure into the terrain. To minimize
the visual impact of detention basins, they shall be designed to
avoid the need for safety fencing. To meet this requirement,
detention basins shall be designed as follows:
(a) Maximum depth of detained runoff shall be 24 inches for a twoyear
or ten-year storm event.
(b) Maximum depth of detained runoff shall be 36 inches for a onehundred-
year storm event.
(c) The basin inflow and outflow structures shall not be located
directly across from each other and shall not be in close
proximity to one another. A length-to-width ratio in all
detention/retention basins and other such storage facilities of
at least 2:1 shall be provided to maximize the flow path
between the inflow point and the outlet structure. The distance
§ 132-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-13
1:395
between these two structures must be at least 50% of the
maximum length of the basin as measured at the top of berm
elevation. Alternatively, a means for extending the time of
surface flow from basin inflow point to basin outlet structure,
designed to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer, may be
utilized.
(4) Except with the one-year design storm, basins shall be designed so
that they return to normal conditions within approximately 12
hours after the termination of the storm, unless the Township
determines that downstream conditions may warrant other design
criteria for stormwater release.
(5) Landscaping and planting in and around the perimeter of basins
shall be provided. Proposed planting shall also be in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance,115 the Towamencin Township Engineering
Standards, and as recommended by the Township Engineer.
(6) If a stormwater management basin will serve as a temporary
sediment control device, the temporary sediment control measures
shall be shown, including perforated riser pipes or standboxes,
filter berms, cleanout stakes and other measures as may be
required by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Chapter 102 Regulations. Plans for such facilities shall require
Montgomery County Conservation District approval prior to
implementation. Sedimentation basins shall be in place prior to any
earthmoving activities within their tributary drainage areas. A note
identifying the above criteria shall be on the erosion and
sedimentation control plan.
(7) Stormwater management basins shall be in place before the
creation of any new impervious surfaces on the site. As-built
drawings of the basins shall be submitted to the Township for
review. The basin shall not be considered functional until it is
proved by the developer that the basin meets the volume
requirements and the outflow characteristics of the original design
of the basin(s).
(8) Runoff shall not be directed to any infiltration structure until all
tributary drainage areas are stabilized.
(9) Where permanent retention (pond) facilities are proposed, there
shall be a safety ledge, 10 feet wide, no greater than 15 inches and
no less than 12 inches below the permanent water surface level.
(10) All basins shall have slopes of four horizontal to one vertical (4:1 =
25%), or flatter. The top or toe of any slope shall be located a
minimum of five feet from any property line. The maximum
115. Editor's Note: See Chapter 136, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 132-13 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:396
difference between the top of berm elevation and the invert
elevation of the outlet structure shall be seven feet.
(11) All portions of a detention basin bottom shall have a minimum slope
of 2%. For portions of basin bottoms with grades less than 2%, the
applicant shall provide a landscape design which minimizes
maintenance provisions and encourages infiltration. These
requirements may be altered when approved by the Township
Engineer.
(12) All basin embankments shall be placed in lifts not to exceed one
foot in thickness, and each lift shall be compacted to a minimum of
95% of Modified Proctor Density as established by ASTMD-1557.
Prior to proceeding to the next lift, the compaction shall be checked
by a soils engineer employed by the applicant/developer.
Compaction tests shall be run on the leading and trailing edge of
the berm along with the top of the berm. Verification of required
compaction shall be submitted to the Township prior to utilization
of any basin for stormwater management.
(13) Emergency overflow facilities/spillway shall be provided within
basins in order to convey basin inflow in excess of design flows, out
of the basin, or in the event the outlet structure becomes blocked
and is unable to convey flow. Emergency spillways discharging over
embankments shall be constructed of reinforced concrete
checkerblocks to protect the berm against erosion. Alternative
spillway erosion control lining may be utilized if approved by the
Township Engineer. The checkerblocks shall be backfilled with
topsoil and seeded. Checkerblock lining shall extend to the toe of
the embankment on the outside of the berm, and shall extend to an
elevation of three feet below the spillway crest on the inside of the
berm. Vegetated spillways may be utilized for spillways constructed
entirely on undisturbed ground (i.e., not discharging over fill
material). A dense cover of vegetation shall be rapidly established
in such spillways by sodding or seeding with a geotextile anchor.
The vegetated spillway must be stabilized before runoff is directed
to the basin. The minimum capacity of all emergency spillways
shall be equivalent to the peak flow rate of the one-hundred-year,
postdevelopment design storm (entering to the basin).
(14) In all cases, the discharge end of the basin shall be provided with a
properly designed outlet control structure (headwall, orifice
structure or other approved flow control structure), culvert pipe,
and endwall. Perforated riser pipes alone, without provision for
permanent outlet control structure (as stated above), and culvert
pipe are not permitted for permanent basins.
(15) The minimum top of basin berm width (at the design elevation)
shall be 10 feet. A cutoff trench (keyway) of impervious material
shall be provided under all embankments that require fill material.
§ 132-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-13
1:397
The cutoff trench shall be a minimum of eight feet wide and three
feet deep and have side slopes of one horizontal to one vertical.
(16) The minimum freeboard through the emergency spillway shall be
one foot. "Freeboard" is defined as the difference between the
design flow elevation through the spillway and the elevation of the
top of the settled basin berm.
(17) Anti-seep collars shall be installed around the pipe barrel and shall
be centered within the normal saturation zone of the berm. The
anti-seep collars and their connections to the pipe barrel shall be
watertight. The anti-seep collars shall be cast in place and extend a
minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the principal pipe
barrel. Precast collars shall be permitted if approved by the
Township. A minimum of two collars shall be installed on each basin
outlet pipe.
(18) A perforated sediment control structure, sized in accordance with
Montgomery County Conservation District requirements, shall be
provided at each basin outlet structure (if more than one is to be
utilized) for sediment control. Sediment control structures shall not
be removed until the entire area tributary to the basin has been
permanently stabilized and until approved by the Montgomery
County Conservation District.
(19) All basin outlet pipes shall be watertight reinforced concrete
having "O-Ring" joints. All joints shall be mortared. Crushed stone
bedding/backfill shall not be utilized through basin berms.
(20) The top of outlet structure box shall be at least six inches lower
than the elevation of the emergency spillway. Six inches, minimum,
is also required between the one-hundred-year water surface
elevation and the top of outlet structure box.
(21) Energy dissipating devices (rock lining/rip rap, or other approved
materials) shall be provided at all basin outlets and shall be sized in
accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation Publication,
Erosion and Sediment Control Program Manual, latest revision.
(22) Stone gabion baskets or concrete or segmental block retaining
walls shall not be permitted for use in construction of detention/
retention basins.
(23) Access easement and stabilized drive to stormwater detention
facilities shall be provided for maintenance and operation. This
access easement shall be cleared and, when possible, be at least 20
feet in width. Multiple accesses shall be encouraged for major
facilities. The developer shall provide access easements and drives
of interlocked, reinforced pervious paving system (backfilled with
topsoil and seeded) or other similar paver acceptable to the
Township Engineer, over a six-inch bed of compacted PennDOT
§ 132-13 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-13
1:398
Type 3A coarse aggregate (or approved equivalent). Accessways
to basins shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide and be no steeper
in slope than 10 feet horizontal to one foot vertical (10:1). In
addition, depressed curb and concrete apron shall be provided
where the accessway enters a street/driveway and the stabilized
driveway shall extend from the bottom of the interior basin berm
embankment to the point of access to the basin from a public
right-of-way or paved driveway within an access easement. Access
easements shall be owned and maintained by the individual lot
owner(s) or homeowner's association but shall be established to
permit access by Towamencin Township or its designee, for
emergency inspection and/or maintenance, at any reasonable time.
(24) If the basin is not designed to meet the requirements of
§ 132-13H3, a split-rail fence must be provided as follows:
(a) A level area (two-percent slope) eight feet in width shall be
provided on both the inside and outside of the fence, along the
entire length of the fence, for proper access by maintenance
equipment. The total width of this generally level area shall be
at least 16 feet.
(b) Each basin fence installation shall include two points of access
with ten-foot-wide self-closing, self-latch gates to allow for
maintenance equipment/vehicle access.
(c) Fences shall be split-rail consisting of locust posts (three rail),
four feet high, minimum, with assorted hardwood rails (eight
feet to 10 feet long), and epoxy-coated wire mesh (black or
green in color) installed on the outside of the fence.
(d) Split-rail fences shall also be required around any detention or
retention basin, where directed by Towamencin Township.
(25) All stormwater management facilities designed to permanently
retain water shall be constructed in a manner to allow such
facilities to be drained for periodic inspection or maintenance, as
approved by the Township Engineer.
I. General design requirements.
(1) Prior to finish grading of a development site and final overlay of
streets, roads, and driveways, temporary measures, acceptable to
the Township, shall be taken to ensure that all runoff intended to be
intercepted and collected by an inlet or other facility will be
collected. The design shall include such details, notes, or
specifications, including bituminous "eyebrows" at inlets, diversion
berms, etc.
(2) Water originating from other than natural sources, such as airconditioning
units, sump pumps, or other dry weather flow,
wherever practical and possible, shall be connected to a storm

sewer, or street drainage structure, or other approved stormwater
conveyance facility that is designed as part of a stormwater
management BMP.
(3) All stormwater runoff and floodplain calculations and stormwater
management facilities design shall be prepared by a professional
engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(4) When subdivisions or land developments are submitted to the
Township for approval in sections, a complete storm sewer design
for the proposed subdivision and land development shall be
submitted. The proposed design must include the entire tract and
not a portion.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Township shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the occupancy or continuation of an adverse
hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed.
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations shall use generally accepted
calculation techniques that are based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex
Method. Table 132-14-1 summarizes acceptable computation methods.
Method must be selected by the applicant based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site. The
Rational Method may be used to estimate peak discharges from
drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres.

B. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return period storms according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0,
rain data corresponding to the Graterford 1E rain gage (No. 36-3437),
Schwenksville, Pennsylvania, as presented in Table B-1 of Appendix
132B of this chapter.116 For regulated activities within the Neshaminy
Creek Watershed, rain data corresponding to the Doylestown rain gage
(36-2221) shall be utilized. The SCS Type II rainfall curve data from
NOAA is listed in Figure B-1 in Appendix 132B of this chapter. This data
may also be directly retrieved from the NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2,
Version 3.0 website: hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds. If a hydrologic
computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24
hours.
C. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from
Table B-4 in Appendix 132B of this chapter.
D. Suggested runoff coefficients (C) for both existing and proposed
conditions for use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table
B-4 in Appendix 132B of this chapter.
E. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate time of concentration for overland flow and
return periods from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, rain data
corresponding to the Graterford 1E rain gage (No. 36-3437),
Schwenksville, Pennsylvania, as presented in Table B-3 of Appendix
132B of this chapter. For regulated activities within the Neshaminy
Creek Watershed, rain data corresponding to the Doylestown rain gage
(36-2221) shall be utilized. The Rational Method rainfall curve data
from NOAA is listed in Figure B-2 in Appendix 132B of this chapter.
Times of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
116. Editor's Note: Appendix 132B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 132-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-14
1:401
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time
by NRCS). Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's Equation.
F. For the purposes of existing conditions flow rate determination for all
development activity, undeveloped land shall be considered as
"meadow" in good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates
a lower curve number (CN) or Rational "C" value (e.g., forest), as listed
in Tables B-2 and B-4 in Appendix 132B of this chapter. Wooded areas
shall use a ground cover of "woods in good condition." An area shall be
considered wooded if there is a contiguous canopy of trees existing over
an area of 1/4 acre or more.
G. For development and redevelopment sites, the ground cover used to
determine the existing conditions runoff volume and flow rate for the
developed portion of the site shall be based upon actual land cover
conditions. If the developed site contains impervious surfaces, 20% of
the impervious surface area shall be considered as "meadow" in good
condition in the model for existing conditions runoff volume and flow
rate.
H. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning Equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-5 in Appendix 132B of
this chapter.
I. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
J. The design of any stormwater management facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing
the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 20 acres in area,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph.
K. Infrequent storm. The rational runoff coefficients given in this chapter
are applicable for the two-year through ten-year frequency design
storm event. Less frequent, higher-intensity storms require
modification of the runoff coefficient because infiltration and other
losses have a proportionally smaller effect on runoff (Wright-
McLaughlin 1969). The adjustment of the Rational Method for use with
major storms shall be made by multiplying the rational formula by a
frequency factor Cf. Cf values are as follows: twenty-five-year frequency
design storm, 1.1; fifty-year frequency design storm, 1.2; one-hundredyear
frequency design storm, 1.25. The product of Cf and Rational
Coefficient C shall not exceed 1.0.
§ 132-14 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-14
1:402
§ 132-15. Erosion and sedimentation requirements.
L. The time of concentration (Tc) is the time required for water to flow
from the hydraulically most remote point of the drainage area to the
point of interest (design point). Use of the rational formula requires
calculation of a Tc for each design point within the drainage basin.
Travel time estimation for the rational method shall be based on NRCS
Technical Release No. 55 (2nd Edition). For design purposes, the time
of concentration may not be less than five minutes. Travel time (Tt) is
the time it takes runoff to travel from one location to another in a
watershed (subreach) and is a component of time of concentration. Tc is
computed by summing all the travel times for consecutive components
of the drainage conveyance system.
M. Water moves through a watershed as sheet flow, shallow concentrated
flow, open channel flow, or some combination of these. Sheet flow rates
shall be calculated using the NRCS TR-55 (1986) variation of the
kinematic wave equation. Sheet flow length may not exceed 50 feet
over paved surfaces and 150 feet over unpaved surfaces. Maximum
permitted sheet flow length shall be 150 feet unless site-specific
conditions exist (that can be demonstrated) that warrant an increase of
the sheet flow length. Under no circumstances shall sheet flow length
exceed 300 feet. Shallow concentrated flow time and open channel flow
time shall be calculated using standard engineering methodologies.
A. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this
chapter, the Montgomery County Conservation District, and
Towamencin Township, and to meet all requirements under
Pennsylvania Code Title 25, Chapter 102, Erosion and Sediment
Control, and the Clean Streams Law.117 Various BMPs and their design
standards are identified in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual, No. 363-2134-008 (March 2012), as amended and
updated.
B. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be or are recommended to be applied where
infiltration BMPs are proposed include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity. Thirty-three-inch
super filter fabric fence (or other approved protection mechanism)
must be installed around proposed infiltration areas to prevent
encroachment and compaction by construction equipment.
117. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 132-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-15
1:403
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization. If necessary, thirty-three-inch super
filter fabric fence (or other approved protection mechanism) must
be installed in the vicinity of the infiltration area to prevent
contamination by runoff containing suspended sediment.
(3) Areas of the site to remain undisturbed shall be protected from
encroachment by construction equipment/vehicles to maintain the
existing infiltration characteristics of the soil. Four-foot-high
orange safety fence or other similar protection fence approved by
the Township must be installed around the entire limit of
disturbance/clearing prior to commencement of earthmoving
activities, and maintained until completion of all construction
activity.
C. Peak discharge rates from the site during land disturbance shall comply
with the appropriate sections in this chapter related to allowable
postdevelopment stormwater runoff rates, with the following additions:
(1) For purposes of calculating required detention storage during land
disturbance, peak discharges shall be calculated based upon the
runoff coefficients for bare soils during the period of maximum
anticipated disturbance from clearing and grading, in combination
with the entire quantity of proposed impervious surface
installation, indicated on the development plan. Runoff controls
shall insure that the peak rate of "during construction" runoff does
not exceed predevelopment runoff rates for the two-year frequency
through one-hundred-year frequency design storm events.
Detention storage during the period of land disturbance and prior
to establishment of permanent cover may require additional
detention facilities on a temporary basis. Such measures shall be
located so as to preserve the natural soil infiltration capacities of
the planned infiltration areas. Calculations based on the above
parameters must be submitted to verify compliance with this
requirement.
(2) Wherever soils, topography, cut and fill or grading requirements, or
other conditions, suggest substantial erosion potential during land
disturbance, the Township may require that the entire volume of all
storms up to a two-year storm from the disturbed areas be retained
on site and that special sediment trapping facilities (such as check
dams, etc.) be installed.
D. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
E. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) has
regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan for any
§ 132-15 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-15
1:404
§ 132-16. Water quality requirements.
earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa.
Code § 102.4(b).
F. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92,118 a PADEP NPDES
construction activities permit is required for any earth disturbance of
one acre or more with a point source discharge to surface waters or the
regulated small municipal separate storm sewer system, or five acres or
more regardless of the planned runoff (hereinafter collectively referred
to as "regulated earth disturbance activities"). This includes earth
disturbance on any portion of, part of, or during any stage of, a larger
common plan of development.
G. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate PADEP regional office or Montgomery
County Conservation District must be provided to the Township. The
issuance of an NPDES construction permit or permit coverage under
the statewide general permit (PAG-2) may satisfy the requirements of
§ 132-15D.
H. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by PADEP regulations, shall be available at the
project site at all times.
A. In addition to the performance standards and design criteria of Article
III of this chapter, the developer shall comply with the following water
quality requirements unless otherwise exempted by provisions of this
chapter.
B. Detain the one-year, twenty-four-hour design storm using the SCS Type
II distribution. Provisions shall be made so that the one-year storm
takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a point
where the maximum volume of water from the one-year storm is
captured (i.e., the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the
facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The
design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances of
clogging the outlet orifice and prevent sediment buildup.
C. In order to protect and maintain water quality, additional stormwater
runoff created by the development project must be captured, stored,
and treated and the volume that must be treated, called the Water
Quality Volume (WQv), shall be as indicated below. The formula for
determining WQv, which shall be measured in acre-feet, is:
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12, where:
118. Editor's Note: See now 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92a.
§ 132-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-16
1:405
P = Rainfall depth in inches, using the "90% storm," the volume of
rainfall for 90% of the storm events which produce runoff in
the watershed annually.
A = Project area in acres.
Rv = Volume runoff coefficient [0.05 + 0.009(I)], where I is the
impervious surface percentage (impervious area ÷ total
project area) x 100%.
D. To accomplish Subsections A and B above, the developer may submit
original and innovative designs to the Township Engineer for review
and approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality objectives
through a combination of BMPs (best management practices).
Infiltration BMPs shall be used wherever feasible. Wet ponds, artificial
wetlands, or other permanent BMPs acceptable to the Township, shall
be used if infiltration BMPs are deemed not feasible.
E. In selecting the appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the land
developer shall consider the following:
(1) Total contributing area.
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock.
(4) Seasonal high water table.
(5) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
(6) Erodibility of soils.
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
F. The following additional factors must be considered and addressed
when evaluating the suitability of BMPs used to control water quality at
a given development site:
(1) Peak discharge and required volume control.
(2) Streambank erosion.
(3) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
(4) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
(5) The nature of the pollutant being removed.
(6) Maintenance requirements.
(7) Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
(8) Recreational value.
§ 132-16 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 132-16
1:406
(9) Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.
G. The applicant is required to schedule a meeting with the Township
Engineer to discuss the design of the BMPs chosen prior to plan
submission.
H. Postconstruction runoff control requirements.
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements
after construction is complete.
(2) The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses
(e.g., drinking water use, cold water fishery use) and maintain the
level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in "special protection"
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 (collectively referred to herein as "state water quality
requirements").
(3) To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated
earth disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can
be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff
conditions, so that postconstruction stormwater discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. As described in the PADEP Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Policy (No. 392-0300-002, September 28,
2002), this may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
(b) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff; and
(c) Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume
and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring
and erosion).
(4) PADEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure
design, implementation and maintenance of BMPs that control
runoff from new development and redevelopment (hereinafter
"development") after regulated earth disturbance activities are
complete. These requirements include the need to implement
postconstruction stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term
operations and maintenance of those BMPs.
§ 132-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-16
1:407
(5) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate PADEP regional office
or Montgomery County Conservation District must be provided to
the Township. The issuance of an individual NPDES construction
permit [or permit coverage under the statewide general permit
(PAG-2)] may satisfy the requirements of § 132-16H(1).

Street Openings
§ 133-5. Intent.
It is the intent of the Supervisors of Towamencin Township that, in order
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general community, the
opening of streets be regulated by permit.
§ 133-6. Permit required.
It shall be unlawful for any person to make any street opening without first
securing a permit therefor from the Township of Towamencin; provided,
however, that any person maintaining pipes, lines or underground conduits
in or under the surface of any street by virtue of any law, ordinance or
franchise may proceed with an excavation or opening without a permit
when emergency circumstances demand the work be done immediately for
the preservation of the public health, safety or welfare, provided that the
permit could not reasonably and practically have been obtained beforehand.
Such person, however, shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular
business day on which the office of the Township is open for business, and
the permit shall be retroactive to the date when work was begun. Any
work done in accordance with this section on an emergency basis shall still
comply with all of the specifications and standards as set forth hereinafter
in this chapter.
§ 133-7. Application.
Any person intending to make a street opening shall make written
application therefor to the Township on a form provided for that purpose,
not less than 10 working days prior to the commencement of work. No
work shall be commenced until the Township has approved the application
and issued a permit, except emergency work as provided under § 133-6
hereof. Each application shall be accompanied by an accurate drawing
clearly showing the extent of the proposed street opening and the location
and depth of the subsurface facilities to be installed and, when required by
the Township, the location and depth of all other surface facilities in the
vicinity of the work.
§ 133-8. Fee and deposit.
A. The applicant shall pay a fee or fees and may be required to post escrow
to guarantee satisfactory completion of the work associated with the
street opening in accordance with provisions set forth at the time of the
issuance of the street opening permit and in accordance with the fees
set forth in the then-current fee schedule which shall have been
adopted by resolution by the Board of Supervisors (refer to Chapter 76,
Fees).
B. The Township shall determine the amount of the escrow to be posted by
the permittee, basing the amount upon the current prices for similar

street repaving work, to which amount shall be added the cost of
any additional work which might be necessary to restore the street to
acceptable condition, plus the estimated costs of inspection and the
estimated costs of any other services which the Township might have to
perform during the course of the work.
C. The deposit may be in the form of cash, certified treasurer's check or
cashier's check payable to the Township.
D. Upon completion and final inspection of the work, the Township shall
make an accounting to the permittee of all costs incurred by the
Township in connection with the permit, to which the Township may
add any reasonable sum to cover anticipated costs of future
maintenance. The Township shall thereupon refund to the permittee
any amount of deposit in excess of that computed as aforesaid, or if the
deposit is found to be insufficient, the permittee shall immediately pay
to the Township any amount equal to the deficiency. If the permittee
fails or refuses to pay such deficiency upon demand, the Township may
recover the same by action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Until
such deficiency is paid in full, additional permits may be denied such
permittee.
A. The applicant shall furnish certificates of insurance as required by the
Township.
B. Prior to the issuance of a permit under this chapter, the applicant shall
be required to furnish a certificate of insurance. The certificate of
insurance required of the applicant shall indicate that he/she is insured
against claims for damages for personal injury as well as against claims
for property damages which may arise from or out of the performance
of the work, whether such performance is by himself, his subcontractor
or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him/her. Such insurance
shall include protection against liability arising from completed
operations. Such insurance shall provide complete third-party coverage
for the Township of Towamencin. The amount of such insurance shall be
prescribed by the Township Engineer in accordance with the nature of
the risks involved; provided, however, that the liability insurance for
bodily injury in effect shall be in an amount not less than $100,000 for
each person and $300,000 for each accident and for property damage
in an amount not less than $50,000. Failure of the applicant to file such
certificate shall be grounds for denying a permit.

permittee, subject to the terms and conditions of the permit, to
temporarily occupy and use the street surface during the course of
construction work covered by the permit and to thereafter occupy the
space within which the work is to be located, subject in every case to

which may accrue by reason of the work.

the date of issuance. If the permittee shall be unable to complete the work
within the specified time, he shall, prior to expiration of the permit, present
in writing to the Township a request for an extension of time, setting forth
therein the reasons for the requested extension. If, in the opinion of the
Township, such an extension is necessary, the permittee may be granted
additional time for the completion of the work.
§ 133-13. Revocation of permit.
Any permit issued hereunder may be revoked by the Township after notice
for violation of any condition of the permit or any ordinance of the
Township, including but not limited to completing the work as set forth
in the time constraints contained in the permit or performing the work in
accordance with the specifications as set forth hereinafter.
§ 133-14. Inspections.
The work shall be subject at all times to inspection by the Township or
its agents, and the permittee shall pay the costs of such inspection as

Law."141 [Added 5-23-2001 by Ord. No. 01-7]
A. In lieu of posting financial security or depositing securities as above
provided, the owner may elect to deposit with the Township funds in an
equivalent amount to be held in escrow per an agreement prepared by
the Township Solicitor which shall be entered into by the owner, the
Township and the escrow agent, if any. Such escrow agreement shall
provide that, as the work of constructing the required public
improvements progresses, the Township or escrow agent holding said
funds will release and refund at the request of the owner, from the
funds deposited, sums equivalent to the estimated value of work
completed, less 10% retainage, upon delivery of a certificate of
completion signed by the owner, the Township Engineer, the Township
Manager and the Township Solicitor. Otherwise, said funds are to be

Township in the event the owner fails or neglects to perform the terms
provided for under § 136-403 hereof.
B. After the owner shall have completed all of the improvements required
by said escrow agreement and has received the final payment provided
under the aforementioned escrow agreement, and has received the
final payment provided under the aforementioned procedure, after the
Board of Supervisors shall have accepted the streets, facilities and
other improvements as public streets, public facilities, and public
improvements in the manner provided, the remaining escrow shall be
reduced to 15% of the fund and shall serve to guarantee the
maintenance, repair or reconstruction of the said improvements by the
owner, for a period of 18 months thereafter, required under the
provisions of § 136-403 hereof, and said remaining fund will, upon
faithful compliance with those provisions, be released and refunded to
the owner upon the signatures of the Chairman and Secretary of the
Board of Supervisors. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the owner
from substituting a maintenance bond by a company satisfactory to the
Board of Supervisors, and, in such case, the 15% remaining in the funds
shall be released and refunded at the same time that the maintenance
bond is accepted by the Township Board of Supervisors.
C. The improvements guarantee, whether in the form of bond or deposit
agreement, shall be conditioned upon:
(1) The owner constructing or installing, or causing to be constructed
or installed, the streets, drainage facilities, water and sewer
facilities, curbs, sidewalks, street signs, lighting facilities, capped
sewers, shown on said plans, as the Board of Supervisors may
require the owner to construct or install;
(2) The owner maintaining, at his own cost, the streets, curbs,
drainage facilities, water and sewer facilities, sidewalks, street
signs, parks, monuments, capped sewers and other improvements,
until the same are accepted or condemned by the Township for
public use and for a period of 18 months thereafter repairing and
reconstructing the same or any part of the improvements when
such repair or reconstruction shall be specified as necessary, by
reason of faulty construction, by the Board of Supervisors;
(3) The payment by the owner of the costs of lighting the streets in the
subdivision until such time as the streets are accepted by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors or by condemnation
proceedings;

§ 136-405. Registration of agricultural subdivisions.
A. Criteria. The subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of 10 acres (40,470 square meters) or more, not involving any
new street or easement of access or any residential dwelling unit, shall
be exempted from these subdivision regulations. To ensure compliance
with the criteria for exemption, no owner shall effect a subdivision or a
division of land, even for agricultural purposes in parcels of more than
10 acres (40,470 square meters), unless the owner received a
certification of exemption from the Board of Supervisors based upon
the owner's proof that:
(1) The parcels shall each be more than 10 acres (40,470 square
meters) in size;
(2) All parcels shall be used for agricultural purposes;
(3) No new street or easement of access or any residential dwelling
unit shall be involved.
B. Application. To apply for the certification, the owner shall submit the
required proofs in the form required by this chapter for minor
subdivision plans and, in addition to a notarized statement
acknowledging ownership, the following statement shall appear on the
plan with the signature of the owner:
"All lots shown hereon are at least 10 acres (40,470 square meters)
in area and are to be used exclusively for agricultural purposes in
accordance with the Towamencin Township Zoning Ordinance, as last
amended, and Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, as last
amended."
C. Action. If the Board of Supervisors finds that all of the criteria are met,
the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors shall sign the plan. If the
Board of Supervisors finds that all of the criteria are not met, the Board
of Supervisors shall notify the owner that the proposed subdivision is
required to comply with all of the procedures and requirements of these
regulations.

ARTICLE V
Design Standards
§ 136-500. Applicability.
§ 136-501. General design standards.
The following principles of subdivision and land development, general
requirements, and minimum standards of design shall be observed by the
applicant in all instances:
A. The standards and requirements outlined herein shall be considered
minimum standards and requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
B. Where literal compliance with the standards specified herein is clearly
impractical, the Board of Supervisors may, upon the written request of
the applicant, modify or adjust the standards to permit reasonable
utilization of property while securing substantial conformance with the
objectives of this chapter. Such modifications, together with the reasons
therefor, shall be in writing.
C. Where areas or instances of design arise not directly addressed by this
chapter, the guidelines, policies, and standards of practice of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service, the U.S. Department of Transportation,
Montgomery County Soil and Water Conservation District, the
American Society of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the
American Society of Civil Engineers, the Institute of Traffic Engineers
and other generally recognized design authorities shall be consulted
and observed by the applicant. In all instances where the minimum
standards of design are not sufficient to protect the health, welfare, and
safety of the public, the Board of Supervisors, upon the advice of the
Township Planning Commission and Township Engineer, reserves the
right to require higher standards of design.
A. All subdivisions shall conform to design standards that will encourage
good development patterns within the Township. All subdivisions shall
conform to the streets, drainage right-of-way, school sites, public parks
and playgrounds, etc., as shown on the officially adopted
Comprehensive Plan of Towamencin Township, as last amended.
B. All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots, streets,
public lands or other proposed uses so that remnants and landlocked
areas shall not be created. Exceptions may be made at the discretion of
the Board of Supervisors, upon recommendations from the Township
Planning Commission, when a limited number of lots (comprising no
more than 15% of the total area of any tract) are created, which clearly
will not affect the ultimate development of a particular tract. The
§ 136-500 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 136-501
1:493
burden of proof is on the applicant to show that limited subdivision will
not affect the ultimate development of the entire tract.
C. Whenever possible, applicants shall preserve trees, groves, waterways,
scenic points, historic spots and other community assets and
landmarks. The applicant should refer to the Comprehensive Plan of
Towamencin Township, as last amended, to help identify features
worthy of preservation.
D. Subdivision and land developments should be laid out so as to avoid the
necessity for excessive cut or fill unless specifically warranted by
terrain or location.
E. Floodplain areas shall not be subdivided or developed except in strict
compliance with the standards and requirements of the floodplain
section of this article142 and the Township Zoning Ordinance,143 as last
amended.
F. Where no centralized water supply is available to the subdivision or
land development, the Board of Supervisors may require the subdivider,
developer, or builder to obtain from the Department of Environmental
Resources certificates of approval as to the quality and adequacy of the
water supply proposed to be utilized by the subdivider, developer, or
builder, and approval of the type and construction methods to be
employed in the installation of the individual water supply system, in
accordance with current state and Township regulations. Consideration
should be given to the probability of an eventual interconnection with a
centralized water system in the future.
G. The subdivision plat shall be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained to require the minimum feasible amounts of land coverage,
and the minimum feasible disturbance of soil and site by grading,
excavation and other land alterations.
H. The subdivision plat shall be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained to avoid substantial probabilities of:
(1) Accelerated erosion;
(2) Pollution, contamination, or siltation of water bodies including
ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams;
(3) Damage to vegetation to remain in the subdivision;
(4) Injury to wildlife and fish habitats.
I. Where the subdivision or land development is inaccessible to sanitary
sewers, the Board of Supervisors shall require the subdivider,
developer or builder to obtain from the Department of Environmental
Resources, the Montgomery County Health Department and
142. Editor's Note: See § 136-519, Floodplain areas.

§ 136-502. Community facilities.
Towamencin Township certificates of approval of the sewage disposal
facilities to be provided by the subdivider, developer or builder, in
accordance with current state regulations.
J. Applicants shall observe the ultimate rights-of-way for contiguous
existing streets as prescribed by the Ultimate Right-of-Way Map for the
Township. Additional portions of the corridors for such streets shall be
offered for dedication, when required by the Township, to the
governmental agency having jurisdiction. Applicable building setback
lines shall be delineated as measured from the ultimate right-of-way.
Additional right-of-way may be necessary at intersections for turning
lanes.
K. Proposed subdivision and land development shall be coordinated with
the existing nearby neighborhood so that the community, as a whole,
may develop harmoniously.
L. Improvement construction requirements will be completed under
specifications of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation;
Montgomery County Public Works Department, Roads and Bridges
Division; Department of Environmental Resources; the Montgomery
County Conservation District; the Upper Gwynedd-Towamencin
Municipal Authority; Towamencin Township or other appropriate
agencies or the specifications included herein, whichever specifications
shall result in the more favorable interpretation of this chapter.
M. Construction of facilities. The subdivider, developer or builder shall,
where specified by the governing body, construct and install with no
expense to the Township the streets, curbs, sidewalks, water mains,
sanitary and storm sewers, streetlights, fire hydrants, street signs,
shade trees, monuments and other facilities and utilities specified in
this article. The construction and installation of such facilities and
utilities shall be subject to inspection by appropriate Township officials
during the progress of the work, and the subdivider shall pay for
inspection.
A. In reviewing subdivision plans, the Township Planning Commission
shall consider whether community facilities in the area are adequate to
serve the needs of the additional dwellings proposed by the subdivision
and shall make such report thereon as it deems necessary in the public
interest.
B. Subdividers shall reserve land for both public and quasi-public
community facilities and will reserve areas for facilities normally
required in residential neighborhoods, including churches, libraries,
schools and other public buildings, and parks, playgrounds and
playfields.
§ 136-501 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 136-502
1:495
C. Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities should be
suitably prepared to provide for such use.
D. Prior to the preparation of plans, subdividers of large tracts shall
review with the Township Planning Commission the minimum
standards for various community facilities applicable to the tract being
subdivided.
E. Parks, recreation, and open space land. Except as already provided
within the MRC District, the Township Planning Commission shall
consider the need for suitable open areas for recreation and shall make
a recommendation thereon. Standards to be used by the Township
Planning Commission in determining space for recreation shall be as
follows:

be laid out to discourage their use as feeder or higher class streets.
Township Planning Commission shall provide a recommendation to
the Board of Supervisors regarding the proposed street
arrangement.
(3) Local access streets shall be so designed as to discourage through
traffic.
(4) If, in the opinion of the Township Planning Commission, it is
desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, streets
shall be extended to the boundary of such property.
(5) Streets shall be logically related to topography so as to produce
reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage and suitable building
sites. Streets shall be so arranged to be generally parallel rather
than cross contour lines as well as to prevent the necessity for
excessive cut and fill.
(6) Streets shall be laid out as to avoid hazard areas such as
floodplains, cliffs and steep slopes, large ravines, etc. A dual means
of access which does not go back through the same hazard area
shall be provided for all lots when one of the streets into a
subdivision crosses through a hazard area.
(7) Grading. The street shall be graded to the full width of the right-ofway,
in conformance with Township specifications.
(8) Provisions of streets for future development. Access shall be given
to all lots and portions of the tract in the subdivision and to
adjacent unsubdivided territory. Streets giving such access shall be
improved to the limits of the subdivision when required by the
Township. Remnants, reserve strips and landlocked areas shall not
be created.
(9) New streets. New streets shall be laid out to continue existing
streets at equal or greater right-of-way and cartway widths, where
practical.
(10) Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited, unless designed
as cul-de-sac or designed for access exclusively to neighboring
tracts.

(11) Street names. Continuations of existing streets shall be known by
the same name. Names for new streets shall not duplicate or
closely resemble names of existing streets. All street names are
subject to the approval of the Township. The Township has a list of
approved street names which shall be utilized by the applicant to
name streets.
C. Private driveways.
(1) Where private drives are permitted (drives not to be offered for
dedication and included within the lot area of residential,
commercial and industrial land developments for purposes of
internal circulation, service and access to parking and loading
areas), the minimum width of cartway for an internal private drive
shall conform to Towamencin Township Engineering Standards,147
as last amended. A private drive shall not be a through street and
shall be intended only for the internal use of the land development.
(2) All driveways shall conform with Towamencin Township
Engineering Standards, as last amended, along with the
Towamencin Township Driveway Ordinance,148 as last amended,
with the most stringent standards being applicable.
D. Partial or half streets.
(1) New half or partial streets and temporary turnaround will not be
permitted, except where essential to the reasonable subdivision of
a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards
of this chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for
dedication of the remaining part of the street can be obtained.
(2) Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the
other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the
subdivider to the Township. The Township may authorize a new
perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the
entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision
boundaries.
(3) The subdivider shall provide the entire required right-of-way or as
much thereof as is possible within his property, along all existing
streets that traverse or abut his property.
(4) Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the
Township's Comprehensive Plan, as last amended, or Traffic Study,
as last amended, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for
realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of
the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to
improve and dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of

1:505
such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved and
dedicated by the applicant to the full width as required by these
subdivision regulations.
(5) Where a subdivision borders an adjacent undeveloped parcel, the
Township may require improved stub streets to the adjacent
property line. Temporary turnarounds may be required. All
turnarounds shall be located adjacent to the developer's property
line. Such turnarounds shall be improved without curbs and paved
to the edge of the right-of-way. Additional temporary right-of-way
may be necessary for the turnaround. As the street is continued,
they shall be removed and the street shall be improved to the
typical street standards including a private drive which enters the
improved street.
(6) Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in
satisfying yard or area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, as
last amended, whether the land is to be dedicated to the Township
in fee simple or an easement is granted to the Township.
E. Street classification.
(1) Existing streets. Each street abutting or affecting the design of a
subdivision or land development which is not already classified in
the Towamencin Township Comprehensive Plan, as last amended,
or Township Ultimate Right-of-Way Map shall be classified
according to its function, design and use by the Township Engineer.
(2) Proposed streets. All proposed streets, including private streets,
shall be classified and designed in accordance with their
anticipated average daily traffic (ADT) levels in accordance with
the following chart:
Street Classification Trip Generation (ADT)
Local access Less than 250
Feeder 250 to 1,000

specified in the Towamencin Township Engineering Standards, as last
amended, or PaDOT regulations, whichever provides for the greater
distance.
K. Access.
(1) When subdivisions result in lots abutting a feeder or controlled
access street, a service or marginal access street shall be provided
or the frontage shall be reversed so that the lots contiguous to such
street will front on an internal street with no direct access to the
higher order street. Such service or marginal access street may
also be required for lots abutting feeder streets at the discretion of
the Board of Supervisors.
(2) Screening, through the use of appropriate plant materials, fences
or walls subject to site plan review, shall be provided in a strip of
land along the rear property line of lots with reversed frontage to
buffer lots from the higher order street.
(3) Where subdivisions abut higher order streets and a service road or
reverse frontage is provided, the improvements to the higher order
street shall be provided as part of the construction improvements
for the project.
(4) Where a subdivision results in lots with frontage on such a higher
order street that the provision of a service road or reverse frontage
becomes impractical or unnecessary, the lot or lots in said
subdivision shall have driveways so laid out that it is possible to
turn passenger vehicles on the lot and it is not necessary to back
any passenger vehicle into the street.
(5) No subdivision containing reserve strips controlling access to
streets shall be approved except where the control and disposal of
land comprising such strips has been placed in the control of the
Township under conditions approved by the Board of Supervisors.
L. Access strips to rear lots within R-200 Districts.
(1) General. Whenever a lot is to be created which does not have the
bulk of the lot directly abutting a road, it shall be connected to the
road by an access strip which is held in fee simple ownership as a
part of the interior (rear) lot. The area within the access strip shall
not be used in calculating the minimum lot area required by the
Zoning Ordinance,150 as last amended.
§ 136-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 136-503
1:507
(2) Width. All access strips to rear lots shall have a minimum width of
50 feet (15.24 meters) throughout their entire length, except that
in the case of a rear lot used or to be used strictly for a single
residential unit this may be reduced to 25 feet (7.62 meters).
(3) Location. The location of the access strip must, in the opinion of the
Township Board of Supervisors, be deemed logical and proper
relative to the bulk (body) of the rear lot and surrounding property
configurations, and shall not, in its opinion, adversely affect
environmental features such as woods, steep slopes, streams,
floodplains, etc.
(4) Alignment. Any access strip shall not traverse a slope such that the
driveway therein would be required to be in excess of 10%
gradient; nor should any access strip generally contain a horizontal
turn greater than 45°.
(5) Spacing. There shall be no more than two abutting access strips to
rear lots, including existing access strips on parcels adjacent to
where the new ones are proposed. Each access strip or group of
two shall be separated from the next one by a distance at least
equal to the minimum width of one lot as required in the R-200
Residential District.
M. Driveways. All driveways shall conform to the Township Driveway
Ordinance,151 as last amended, PennDOT, or the Towamencin Township
Engineering Standards,152 as last amended, whichever is greater.
N. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) The cul-de-sac bulb will have a left-hand orientation where
practical as identified by the Towamencin Township Engineering
Standards, as last amended.
(2) The maximum length of a cul-de-sac street shall be determined by
the anticipated traffic volume generated from the street. Except for
within the R-200 District, the maximum anticipated traffic volume
permitted on a cul-de-sac is 250 ADT, as determined by the trip
generation rates within this chapter. Within the R-200 District a
maximum of 15 lots shall be permitted to take access from any
permanent cul-de-sac.
(3) A feeder street with radiating culs-de-sac may be permitted in
order to protect natural features or to provide for open space.
(4) Culs-de-sac shall be readily identifiable as such by traffic moving on
the street to which it is connected, such as by "Way" names.

(5) Where it is proposed that a road be constructed to an abutting
property line with the intention that such road will be extended
onto the adjoining property at a future date, a temporary cul-de-sac
shall be built to the above requirements and easements provided
where the paving exceeds the dedicated right-of-way. The
temporary cul-de-sac shall be built to abut the adjacent property.
O. Private streets in R-200 Districts.
(1) Intent. In keeping with the intent of the R-200 Residential District
to maintain a low-density character and minimize the extension of
suburban-type services and improvements into that district, private
roads are allowed provided they meet the criteria of this section.
(2) Number of lots served. Any accessway which serves as the access
to more than one lot or use shall be considered a private road
rather than an individual driveway, and must be constructed in
accordance with the applicable standards for local access streets.
Whenever more than eight residential lots share a private road, the
provision of a public road is required.
(3) Reconstruction of private road to public standards. The Board of
Supervisors reserves the right to order the reconstruction of the
private road up to Township standards and subsequent dedication
as a public road if they deem the road at any time to be a safety or
health hazard. Costs of such improvements shall be assessed
against the landowners who own the road and be borne totally by
them.
(4) Ownership. The private road shall be owned jointly by all abutting
property owners who have rights to utilize said road, and all shall
be jointly responsible for its maintenance and related costs. An
association of the landowners who have rights to use the road shall
be formed, and must be established and administered in a form
acceptable to the Township Board of Supervisors, and approved by
them prior to or at the same time as subdivision or land
development approval.
(5) Design standards. Where private roads are provided, they shall be
planned and constructed in accordance with the same standards
applicable to public local access streets relative to right-of-way
width, cul-de-sac radius, grades, culverts, drainage, horizontal and
vertical curves, tangents between curves, sight distance,
intersection alignment, intersection radius, interconnection to
adjacent parcels, and similar regulations.
(6) Further subdivision. Further subdivision of any lot fronting on the
private road which would create an additional lot fronting thereon
is prohibited if it would violate the maximum length of culs-de-sac,
or any other provision of this chapter, unless the private road is
reconstructed and dedicated as a public road. The homeowners'
association which controls the road must approve the
§ 136-503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 136-503
1:509
§ 136-504. Sidewalks.
reconstruction and dedication in accordance with the procedures
established in their bylaws prior to the commencement of that
upgrading (unless the Township orders such pursuant the above).
(7) Statement in deed and plan. The responsibilities, authority, and
limitations required shall be clearly stated on the subdivision plan
which creates a private road and as a part of the deed to each lot
having rights to utilize same.
(8) Piecemeal creation of private roads within access strips. An access
strip containing an individual driveway may be upgraded into a
private road at any time, provided the right-of-way width and all
other requirements can be met by separating and establishing the
access strip as a private road right-of-way, widening the existing
driveway to the minimum standards for a private road, and creating
the required turnaround or cul-de-sac at the terminus of the
common-use area. All requirements for private roads shall be
applied thereto. Such transformation is encouraged rather than the
creation of a separate access strip to an adjacent rear lot.
P. Street signs.
(1) The developer shall provide, at his expense, all necessary street
signs as may be required by the Township.
(2) A proposed street that is in alignment with an existing and named
street shall bear the name of the existing street.
(3) In no case shall the name of a proposed street duplicate an existing
street name in the North Penn School District, or in the same postal
zip code, despite the type of suffix.
(4) A list of acceptable street names is available from the Township.
The Township has the final decision on the names of all streets.
A. Where required.
(1) Sidewalks shall be required at any location unless it is determined
by the Board of Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the
Township Planning Commission, that sidewalks are not necessary
for public safety or convenience.
(2) Sidewalks are not required along either side of any road in the
R-200 Residential District, except where deemed necessary for
safety by the Township Board of Supervisors, such as near schools,
bus stops or similar areas of high pedestrian concentration.

centimeters) in caliper, hedgerows and woodlands. As determined by
the Board of Supervisors, the preservation of existing desirable mature
trees, hedgerows and woodlands may be counted in lieu of the
landscape requirements herein, thereby reducing the amount of new
plant material except street trees that would otherwise be required to
be planted. It shall be incumbent on the applicant to prove that the plan
minimizes disturbance of these trees and woodlands, given the
permitted development proposed. The plan shall reflect the following:

than natural sources, such as sump pumps or other dry weather
sources, wherever practicable shall be discharged into natural
watercourses on the property.
(6) Storm drainage system. The storm drainage system shall be
designed and constructed to adequately control the drainage on
and from the subdivision or land development.
(7) Any development which creates a significant change in the
characteristics of the watershed, thus increasing the volume and
velocity of surface water runoff, shall not be permitted until
methods have been proposed which will reduce the likelihood of
erosion, sedimentation and stormwater drainage. Such
improvements must satisfy the requirements and regulations of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
(8) Stormwater discharges from construction activities affecting five
or more acres (20,235 square meters) of land may require a permit
from PaDER. A permit or permit waiver shall be obtained from
PaDER by the applicant. 166

because of flood hazards prohibiting the subdivision and
development of unprotected floodplain areas;
(4) Maintain the certification of Towamencin Township and the
eligibility of the property owners in the Township for the benefits of
the National Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 93.234.
C. Establishment of base flood elevations. For proposed subdivisions
greater than either 50 lots or five acres (20,235 square meters) within
the flood-prone areas in which the Township's Flood Insurance Study
has not established base flood elevations, the developer shall be
responsible for establishing such data through hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analysis, computation, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to
allow a thorough technical review by the Township. Prospective
developers shall consult with the Zoning Officer to make a
determination as to whether or not the proposed subdivision or land
development is located within an identified floodplain.
D. Where not prohibited by this or any other codes or ordinances, land

floodway if any increased flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(2) A waiver shall only be issued if there is:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to relax the requirements would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
(c) A determination that the relaxing of a requirement will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(3) A waiver shall only be issued upon a determination that the waiver
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
(4) The Township shall:
(a) Maintain a record of all waivers including justification for their
issuance; and
(b) Report such decisions issued in its annual report submitted to
the Federal Insurance Administrator.

to provide the Board of Supervisors with the opportunity to assess
the effect of a proposed subdivision, land development or rezoning
request on the transportation system in Towamencin Township. The
purpose of the study is to identify traffic and transportation
problems associated with the adequacy of the existing
transportation network to provide access to, from and through the
site in light of the character and volume of traffic expected to be
generated by the proposed subdivision, land development, and/or
rezoning. This study should also delineate solutions to such
problems or facilities including the prescription of improvements to
be provided by or at the expense of the applicant, consistent with
the Township's Capital Improvement Program.
(2) Preparation of traffic impact study.
(a) The traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic
engineer and/or transportation planner with prior traffic study
experience.
(b) A traffic impact study shall be submitted for all residential
subdivisions or land developments of 10 or more lots or
dwelling units; all commercial, office, industrial, institutional
or other nonresidential uses requiring subdivision or land
development approval; all rezoning requests.
(c) The Township Planning Commission may, upon the
recommendation of the Township Engineer, determine that the
requirement for a traffic impact study is not necessary.
(d) The requirements, procedures, and standards for the traffic
impact study are as set forth in § 136-703I(4).
(3) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:
LEVEL OF SERVICE  As defined in the 1985 Highway Capacity
Manual, Special Report 209, as amended, defines operational
conditions within a traffic stream (or at an intersection approach).
"Level of service" also generally describes these conditions in
terms of such factors as speed, travel time, freedom to maneuver,
traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience and safety. Six levels
§ 136-703 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 136-703
1:543
of service are defined for each type of traffic facility, ranging from
A to F. Level of Service A indicates free flow; Level of Service
B indicates stable flow; Level of Service C indicates stable but
inhibited flow; Level of Service D indicates high-density, restricted
stable flow; Level of Service E indicates operation at or near
capacity; and Level of Service F is indicative of flow breakdown.
MAJOR INTERSECTION  Any intersection where traffic
generated by the proposal will have a significant effect on the
operation of traffic through the intersection. Where doubt exists,
the qualified traffic engineer and/or planner shall seek guidance
from the Township Planning Commission or the Township Engineer
prior to the submission of the traffic impact study.
QUEUE ANALYSIS  This procedure includes the average queue
and maximum queue of vehicles which will be observed in each
traffic stream and intersection approach, measured in both feet
and vehicles. Various statistical and/or computer models may be
applied.
STUDY AREA  This area will extend along all Township, county
and state roads serving the development and will extend to all
major intersections in the Township that may be affected. Where
doubt exists, the qualified traffic engineer and/or transportation
planner will seek guidance from the Township Planning
Commission or Township Engineer prior to the submission of the
study.
TRIP GENERATION  The total count of trips to and from a study
site per unit of land use (i.e., acres, dwelling unit, etc.) as
established by the most recent edition of the institute of
Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Report. For land uses
not listed in this report, or if information is determined through
a small sample size, the qualified traffic engineer and/or
transportation planner shall seek guidance from the Township
Planning Commission or Township Engineer prior to submission of
the study.
VOLUME/CAPACITY ANALYSIS  This procedure compares the
volume of a traffic facility to its capacity. The procedure described
in the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation Research
Board Special Report 209, as amended, shall be followed.
WARRANTS FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL INSTALLATION  A series
of warrants which detail the minimum traffic volume, pedestrian
volume or other criteria necessary for the installation of a traffic
signal. These criteria are contained in the most recent edition of
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and
Highways, United States Department of Transportation, FHWA.

ARTICLE VIII
Administration
§ 136-800. Unnecessary hardship to applicant; modification of
requirements.
A. Where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
chapter and/or its accompanying regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship, the Board of Supervisors may make such
reasonable exception thereto. Proof of unnecessary hardship must be
presented in writing to the Township Planning Commission by the
applicant. The Township Planning Commission shall review the
applicant's request and submit a written report to the Board of
Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors may grant a waiver or deferral to
such applicant from such mandatory provisions, so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest served; provided that such
waiver or deferral will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of these regulations.
B. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater profit would
result if the waiver or deferral were granted. Furthermore, hardship
complained of cannot be self-created; it cannot be claimed by one who
purchases with or without knowledge of restrictions; it must be from
the application of this chapter; it must be suffered directly by the
property in question; and evidence of waiver or deferral granted under
similar circumstances shall not be considered.
C. In granting waivers or deferrals and modifications, the Board of
Supervisors may impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objective of the standards or requirements so waived,
deferred, or modified.
D. Procedure for modification.
(1) The governing body, after comment by the Township Planning
Commission, may grant a modification of the requirements of one
or more provisions of this chapter if the literal enforcement will
exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to
the land in question, provided that such modification will not be
contrary to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of
this chapter is observed.
(2) All requests for such a modification shall be in writing and shall
accompany and be part of the application for development. The
request shall state in full the grounds and facts, relative to
reasonableness or hardship, on which the request is based, the
provision or provisions of the chapter involved, and the minimum
modification necessary.
§ 136-800 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 136-800
1:559
§ 136-801. Required improvements and contracts.
(3) The Board of Supervisors will keep a written record, via its
minutes, of all action on all requests for modification. All waivers or
deferrals granted shall be indicated on the final record plan.
A. Improvement. Before approving any subdivision or land development
plan for recording, the Board of Supervisors shall either require that
the necessary grading, paving and other improvements as herein
specified shall have been installed in strict accordance with the
standards and specifications of the Board of Supervisors, or that the
Board of Supervisors be assured by means of a proper contract and
completion guarantee, as set forth in § 136-802B hereof, that the
improvements will subsequently be installed by the developer. Where
the subdivision or land development plan has been approved and
recorded, either after the specified improvements have been completed
and approved by the Board of Supervisors, or if prior to completion
upon proper completion guarantee as aforesaid, purchasers and
mortgagees of lots in the subdivision or land development, with or
without buildings thereon or on any of them shall be relived of any and
all liability for any deficiency in lack of or failure to complete the
improvements above mentioned as set forth in said plan or required as
a condition precedent to the approval of the plan of subdivision or land
development and any failure to complete or properly complete said
improvements shall not encumber any or all of the lots in the
subdivision or land development.
B. Contracts. In all cases where the necessary grading, paving and other
improvements required herein shall not have been installed in strict
accordance with the standards and specifications of the Township prior
to approval of the final plan, the developers shall agree, in writing, to
the following:
(1) Construct streets and other improvements required by this section
from the lot or lots to be sold or built upon to an existing improved
street, subject to the provisions of § 136-800 herein. The work shall
be performed in strict accordance with approved plans and the
Township Engineering Standards176 or the applicable provisions of
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Publication 408
Specifications, as last amended, or any subsequent number or
section thereof. No plan shall be finally approved until the
developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements as required as a condition for final approval of a plan
or until such time as the applicant has provided a proper guarantee
in the form of a performance bond or bonds with surety satisfaction
to the Township or by the deposit of funds or securities in escrow or
by the presentation of an irrevocable letter of credit from a federal
or commonwealth chartered lending institution. Such financial
176. Editor's Note: The Towamencin Township Engineering Standards are included in Ch. 136A,
which immediately follows this chapter.
§ 136-800 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 136-801
1:560
security shall be posted with a bonding company or federal or
commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
developer, builder or subdivider posting the financial security,
provided that said bonding company or lending institution is
authorized to conduct business within the commonwealth. When
requested by the applicant, to facilitate financing, the Township
shall furnish him with a signed copy of a resolution indicating
approval of the final plat contingent upon the applicant obtaining
satisfactory financial security. The final plat or record plan shall
not be signed nor recorded until the financial security agreement
is executed. The resolution of contingent approval shall expire and
be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is
not executed within 90 days unless written extension is granted
by the Board of Supervisors. Such extension shall be placed in
writing. The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110%
of the cost of the required improvements including construction
contingencies, Township inspection fees, Township engineering
and legal services fees, and as-built drawings for which the
financial security is to be posted, estimated as of 90 days following
the date schedule for completion by the applicant. The cost of
the improvements shall be based upon an estimate prepared by
a professional engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and shall not include financial security for the cost
of any improvement for which financial security is required by and
provided to the Department of Transportation in connection with
the issuance of a highway occupancy permit pursuant to Section
420 of the Act of June 1, 1945, P.L. 1242, No. 428 (known as
the "State Highway Law").177 Said estimate shall be certified by
said engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost.
The Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer,
may refuse to accept said estimate for good cause. Upon such
circumstances, the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified
by a third engineer and shall be presumed fair and reasonable
and shall be the final estimate. Fees for the services of said third
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and applicant. The
applicant shall also guarantee that no lot will be sold or building
constructed in any flood-prone area prior to completion of all
floodproofing measures planned for such lot and necessary access
facilities. [Amended 5-23-2001 by Ord. No. 01-7]
(2) Such financial security shall provide for and secure to the public
the completion of all subdivision improvements for which such
security is being posted by the date fixed in the subdivision plan or
subdivision agreement for completion of such improvements.
Annually, the Township may adjust the amount of financial security
by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been
completed and the estimated cost for completion of the remaining
improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after either the

§ 136-802. Release from liability.
original date scheduled for completion, or a rescheduled date of
completion, to complete the required improvements. The Township
may require the applicant to post additional financial security to
assure that it equals the required 110% of the cost of completion
of the required improvements as reestablished by using the above
procedure.
(3) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Board of Supervisors may authorize the submission of final
plans by sections or stages of development, subject to such
requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future sections
or stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of
any finally approved section of the development.
(4) The provisions of this section shall not relieve the developer from
the penalties provided for in the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,178 as last amended, for violations of this chapter.
A. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release, or authorize the release from time to time, of
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor(s) performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing,
addressed to the Board of Supervisors and subject to the provisions for
release as established in Section 509 of Act 247, the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as last amended.

A. To determine the required buffer yard and planting schedule, the
following three-step procedure shall apply:
(1) Step 1: Site analysis and determination of buffer yard class.
(a) For each property boundary, the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land use or street classification. Land use information
shall be determined by an on-site survey, and the
Comprehensive Plan shall be utilized to determine street
classifications.
(b) Table 1181 specifies the buffer yard class for each boundary. The
applicant shall match his proposed land use with the
corresponding adjacent land use or street classification for
each property boundary. The letter indicates the buffer yard
class.
(2) Step 2: Selection of the planting option for the buffer class.
(a) After determining the buffer class, the applicant shall select a
planting option from Table 2. For each buffer class several
planting options are available, one of which the applicant shall
select to meet the buffer yard requirement for each boundary.
However, the Board of Supervisors may permit an alternative
planting option which shall have a screening capability equal
to, or greater than, any of the available options.
(b) The options set forth in Table 1182 indicate the minimum
amount of plant material that is required per linear foot of
property line. However, the Board of Supervisors shall, at its
discretion, have the power to increase the amount of planting
required (per Table 2) when it is believed that required buffer
materials are not capable of providing a desirable transition
between the existing and proposed land uses. Unless stated
below, plantings are required to be aligned adjacent to
property lines or right-of-way boundaries, but may be sighted
on any portion of the property if permitted by the Board of
Supervisors. Plant materials shall be so arranged to allow for

instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar

Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2) a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other

subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each pay roll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person

levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll
period basis for each pay roll period in which the person is engaging in

collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 143-6. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.

taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or plates of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 143-3 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.

of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject

this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of

for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
pay merits of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered

and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article

C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or if no return was made to ascertain the tax due.
Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the
means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%

date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefore shall in addition be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with

confirms the transfer previously recorded, but which does not
extend or limit existing record, legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration

provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
§ 143-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 143-27

his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is

claims an exemption from taxation under this section.

Classifications.
FHWA Vehicle Classes with Definitions
Class 1. Motorcycles (Optional)  All two or three-wheeled

ARTICLE II
Commuter Parking
[Adopted 12-27-1989 by Ord. No. 89-14]
§ 147-17. Legislative intent.
The Board of Supervisors of Towamencin Township finds that certain
residential areas of townships are subject to commuter vehicle parking,
therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which to
park their own vehicles; those residential streets are also subject to a
high degree of commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of
the ambient air level; and the overburdening of existing streets and roads
generally creates an undesirable dangerous condition to the general health,
safety and welfare of the community. Therefore, the Township Supervisors
wish to establish a residential parking permit program for certain affected
areas where parking is limited by township ordinance; it being the belief of
the Supervisors that it is in the best interest of the people of the Township
to provide for the establishment of such a residential parking zone.
§ 147-18. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, words and terms listed in this section as
follows shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
DWELLING UNIT  A single unit providing complete independent living
facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living
which normally include provisions for sleeping, eating, cooking and
sanitation, but also includes rooms.
MOTOR VEHICLE  A vehicle which is self-propelled, except one which is
propelled solely by human power.
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident but who owns or manages a
business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address.
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide
occupancy, or both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA  A contiguous area containing public highways or
parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and nonbusiness property, such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes.
STREET  A way intended for general public use through means of
approach for vehicles and pedestrians. The word shall include the words
"road," "highway" and "thoroughfare."
§ 147-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-19
1:709
§ 147-19. Criteria.
The residential areas designated in § 147-20 of this article are deemed
impacted and hence eligible for residential parking during periods of time
when on-street parking is prohibited by other ordinance or regulation of the
Township of Towamencin.
§ 147-20. Designated permit areas.
The following areas are designated as areas where permits will be issued
for motor vehicles to be parked during normally prohibited hours:
Name of
Highway Side Location Time Limitation

of 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.,

§ 147-21. Application and eligibility for permit.
Any person residing in a residence abutting on the streets set forth in
§ 147-20 above, or a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street
or other location within a residential permit parking area, shall be eligible
for a permit, but in no event shall more than two permits be issued per
dwelling unit or residence. Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Chief of Police of Towamencin Township, or his designee in
the Police Department, by the person desiring the permit. Each application
shall contain the following information: the name of the owner or the driver
of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident; the make, model and
registration number of the motor vehicles for which the permit must be
used; and the driver number as taken from the applicants current driver's
license. The applicant shall be required, at the time of making application,
to present proof of residency in said area and proof of ownership of a motor
vehicle registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 147-22. Permit fee; term.
The permit shall be good for residential parking in accordance with a
fee schedule as adopted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors of
Towamencin Township. The permit shall be for the calendar year or the
remaining balance thereof. Residential parking permits may be renewed by
qualified residents in accordance with the above § 147-21 upon the payment

§ 147-19 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 147-23
1:710

residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in violation
of any provision of this article. Upon written notification to him of the
revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of
Police. Failure to do so when so requested shall constitute a violation of this
article.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the holder
of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a
motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential parking
area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is prohibited in
that area. While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has
been issued is so parked, that permit shall be displayed so as to be
clearly visible through the windshield of the vehicle. A residential
parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder a parking
space within a designated residential permit parking area.
B. Except during the time limits set forth in § 147-20, a residential parking
permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or park a motor vehicle in
any place or at any time when stopping, standing or parking of motor
vehicles is generally prohibited or set aside for other specified types of
vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the observance of
any traffic or parking regulation.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit
holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the permit holder
and by the person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information and application to the Chief of Police or his
designee in order to obtain a residential parking permit.

height and parking requirements shall be in accordance with the
single-family detached dwelling requirements of this article.
K. Special development regulations. The following special development
regulations shall be applied to any proposed MRC development:
(1) Separation of use types. Different use types within a planned MRC
development shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be separated
by natural features.
(2) Buffer requirements.
(a) External. A buffer yard shall be required around the total
perimeter of the tract. The yard shall be part of the area
assigned to residential lots, unless the lots are expanded by the
§ 153-408 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-408
1:774
width of the buffer, and the use and function of the buffers are
restricted by deed.
[1] Whenever structures with two or more dwelling units in
the MRC District will abut existing single-family detached
dwelling on an adjacent property, a buffer at least 15 feet
wide shall be required which will eventually provide an
effective visual screen at least 15 feet in height. The
primary component of this buffer shall be a row of
evergreen trees spaced not more than 10 feet apart on
center, at least six feet in height when planted; secondary
components shall include mounding, opaque fencing or
other vegetative material as required by the Board of
Supervisors.
[2] Whenever any residential units in the district will abut
existing commercial or business development, or where
the residential units in the MRC District would not be
significantly different in terms of density and structural
type than those which abut it, a less restrictive buffer may
be required. This buffer shall also be at least 15 feet wide,
but could be any combination of evergreen or deciduous
vegetation, mounding or fencing which would ease and
soften, but not essentially block the view from one side to
the other, and would eventually attain a height of 15 feet.
[3] Buffer requirements can be waived by the Board of
Supervisors wherever buffers exist which will fulfill the
same function, or where the units in the MRC District will
be of the same structural type, and approximately the
same density of the dwelling units adjacent to the MRC
District.
(b) Internal. Landscaped buffers at least 15 feet in width will be
required within the MRC development whenever multifamily
dwelling units abut other permitted housing types. The
primary component of this buffer will be the same as detailed
in the external buffer requirements specified in Subsection
K(2)(a) above.
(3) Requirements for open space. The following regulations shall
govern the characteristics and maintenance of the required open
space created by an MRC mixed residential cluster development:
(a) Characteristics of required open space. Open space created
shall have the following minimal requirements:
[1] The land area to be set aside for permanent preservation
as open space shall be located and so shaped as to be
suitable for the purpose intended. Consideration shall be
given to contiguous portions of existing and potential open
§ 153-408 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-408
1:775
space lands in adjacent tracts. The Board of Supervisors
may require the preservation in the Comprehensive Plan.
[2] A minimum of 25% of the gross tract acreage shall be set
aside as open space land. At least 25% of all open space
lands must be planned for active recreational purposes. In
addition, open space land may be required to be set aside
by the Board of Supervisors, at the recommendation of the
Township Planning Commission, if in their opinion, the site
contains appropriate land for such purposes, provided this
does not result in restricting the applicant's entitlement to
the maximum density permitted by this chapter.
[3] Any land in excess of the minimum percentage of open
space land required herein, gained from reducing building
lot areas pursuant to this chapter, may be used for either
of the following:
[a] Additional open space land, for any of the proposed
uses allowed by the provisions of this section.
[b] Building lots in excess of the minimum size required.
(b) Maintenance of required open space. The following
requirements shall govern the maintenance of the required
open space:
[1] The open space land to be set aside or reserved for park,
woodlands, conservation, playground, active recreational
use or other open space purposes, such as the
preservation of natural features, must first be offered for
dedication to the Township, or may be reserved for private
use, if Township officials decline to accept the offer of
dedication, in which case satisfactory arrangements shall
be made, acceptable to the Township, for the maintenance
of all such areas.
[2] The location, extent, and purpose of land proposed to be
set aside for open space or for recreational use must be
reviewed and approved by the Township Planning
Commission before the provisions of this article apply. A
private recreational use such as a golf course or a
swimming pool, whose use is limited to the owners or
occupants of lots located within the subdivision and other
such nearby land-owners who may wish to become
members of the corporation, may be approved as common
land. Other uses on site which may qualify as common land
may include but not be limited to, historic buildings or
sites, natural parks and parkway areas, landscaped parks,
bridle paths, landscaped walkways, extensive areas with
tree cover, and the low land along streams or areas of
§ 153-408 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-408
1:776
rough terrain where such areas are extensive and have
natural features worthy of preservation.
[3] Necessary covenants, easements and/or restrictions must
be established to provide for public utilities, drainage,
trails for hiking or bicycling, or any other permitted use
designated for the benefit of owners or occupiers of the
development if the open space is to be privately owned.
[4] If a development includes a proposal to dedicate to the
Township land for park and/or open space use, under
provisions of this section, the total land area to be
dedicated shall be delineated on the subdivision plan with
a note stipulating that the legal means of conveyance shall
be by dedication.
[5] If a development includes, as part of its open space land,
lands deemed by the Board of Supervisors with the
recommendation of the Township Planning Commission to
be a key element in the Township open space system
according to the Towamencin Township Comprehensive
Plan, such land shall be required to be dedicated to the
Township.
[6] If the open space land is to be retained by the property
owners, the Township will require that the property
owners provide for and establish a homeowners'
association, or other organization or funded community
trust for the ownership and maintenance of the open
space, and that such organization shall not be dissolved
nor shall it dispose of the open space by sale or otherwise,
except to an organization conceived and established to
own and maintain the open space, or by dedication to, and
acceptance by the Township. In the event that a
homeowners' association is contemplated, the association
shall, to the greatest degree practicable, be established
from the start of the project and all homeowners shall be a
party thereof. In addition, homeowners' associations may,
as determined appropriate by the Township Supervisors,
maintain dedicated open space or lease back dedicated
open space land from the Township.
[7] If the open space land is to be controlled by other than the
Township, then all property owners of the tract shall have
equal rights and obligations in the organization and these
rights and obligations shall be included in all deeds which
shall be properly recorded and the agreement containing
these rights and obligations shall be approved by the
Board of Supervisors at the same time as the plan is
approved. In the event that the organization, established
to own and maintain open space land, or any successor
§ 153-408 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-408
1:777
organization shall, at any time after establishment of the
MRC development, fail to maintain the open space land
in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice
upon such organization or upon the property owners of
the MRC development setting forth the manner in which
the organization has failed to maintain the open space
land in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include
a demand that such deficiencies or maintenance be
corrected within 30 days thereof and shall state the date
and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within
14 days of the notice. At such a hearing the Township
may modify the terms of the original notice as to the
deficiencies and may give an extension of time within
which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth
in the original notice or in the modifications thereof shall
not be corrected within said 30 days of any extension
thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the taxable
values of nearby properties and to prevent the open space
land from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon
said open space, and maintain the same for a period of
one year. Said maintenance by the Township shall not
constitute a taking of said open space, nor vest in the
public any rights to use same. Before the expiration of said
year, the Township shall, upon its initiative, or upon the
request of the organization therefore responsible for the
maintenance of the open space land, call a public hearing
upon notice to such organization, or to be held by the
Board of Supervisors, at which hearing such organization
or the residents of the cluster development shall show
cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not,
at the option of the Township, continue for a succeeding
year. If the Board of Supervisors shall determine that such
organization is ready and able to maintain said open space
land in reasonable condition, the Township shall cease to
maintain said open space land at the end of said year.
If the Board of Supervisors shall determine that such
organization is not ready and able to maintain said open
space land in a reasonable condition, the Township may
in its discretion continue to maintain said open space land
during the next succeeding year and, subject to a similar
hearing and determination in each year thereafter.
[8] The cost of maintenance by the Township shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the development and
shall become a lien on said properties. The Township, at
the time of entering upon said open space land for the
purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in the
office of the Prothonotary of the County, upon the
§ 153-408 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-408
1:778
properties affected by the lien within the MRC
development.
(4) Development impact study. To ensure that a proposed MRC
development will not have an adverse effect upon the natural
features of the site, as well as upon the provision of light and air,
water, transportation, police and fire protection, schools, utilities
and other public facilities, the Board of Supervisors and the
Township Planning Commission shall evaluate the impact of the
development upon the site, the surrounding neighborhood, and the
facilities and services of Towamencin Township as listed below. The
applicant shall provide all of the information, data and studies
needed to reach conclusive evaluations of these items.
(a) The conformance of the proposed development with the
Comprehensive Plan of Towamencin Township, and
compatibility with existing and proposed land uses adjacent to
the site.
(b) The impact on existing floodplains, waterways, heavily wooded
areas, steep slopes and other sensitive natural features, if any.

study required in herein, shall be evaluated to determine the
suitability of the site in question to accommodate the magnitude of
development proposed, as well as the impact of the proposed
development on the community facilities and services of
Towamencin Township. The following alternative findings shall
result from the evaluation process:
(a) Evaluation which leads to a positive assessment for a proposed
development shall be approved by the Board.
(b) Evaluations which lead to an overall negative assessment for a
proposed development shall lead to a denial by the Board.
(c) Evaluations which lead to an overall negative assessment for a
proposed development may lead to a conditional approval by
the Board either: when the developer agrees to undertake
activities or improvements which will compensate or correct
deficiencies or negative impacts caused by the implementation
of the proposed development; or when the developer agrees to
implement the proposed development at a lower density, as
specified by the Board.
(6) Special development regulations for small lot singles. The following
special development regulations shall apply to all small lot singlefamily
detached dwelling units within a planned MRC development:
(a) Deed restriction against construction outside of building
envelope. Before approval of any subdivision plan in
accordance with this subsection, the plan shall show clearly, in
a manner acceptable to the Board of Supervisors, with
appropriate legends, those areas outside of the required

accordance with the architectural guidelines), and similar projections may, in the discretion
of the Board of Supervisors exceed height limitations provided no such elements in excess of
the maximum height restrictions shall be used for occupancy, parking, or storage of any type.
E. Residential densities: not to exceed a density of eight dwelling units per
acre.
F. Parking requirements: all uses shall be regulated by type.
(1) Reserve parking. Due to mixing of uses, reserve parking up to 25%
of that required may be allowed in order to create open space
without unnecessarily requiring more paving than required.
Reserve parking shall be designed and engineered but need not be
constructed unless directed by the Board of Supervisors.
(2) Credit. Up to 30% of total required parking shall be permitted offsite
when associated with an approved common parking facility or
within the transportation center complex.
(3) Structured parking facilities shall be utilized for required parking
in accordance with the standards in the Towamencin Village Land
Use and Design Manual,219 except as shall be modified by the Board
of Supervisors as part of the conditional use approval. [Amended
10-8-2008 by Ord. No. 08-06]
(a) For all sectors, structured parking on the first floor (street
level) of any building or structure shall not exceed 50% of the
square foot areas of the first floor. Permitted uses other than
parking shall be located adjacent and parallel to streets and
pedestrian easements; provided, however, that these
requirements shall not apply where the top parking level of a
structured parking facility is at the same level as the nearest
public street or pedestrian easement, and no other portion of
the structure is within 200 feet of any other public street or
pedestrian easement.
(4) The Board of Supervisors, as part of the conditional use approval,
may permit a reduction in the sum total of the required parking for
all of the uses based on the following:
(a) In the case of a development plan in which there are
efficiencies derived by shared parking for uses which have
complementary peak demands. The applicant shall submit
parking generation data, based upon standard methodology
(such as that published by the Urban Land Institute or from
actual parking studies within the region) sufficient for the
Township to determine the appropriate reduction.
219. Editor's Note: The Manual is on file in the Township offices.
§ 153-416 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-416
1:807
(b) In the case of a development consisting solely of two or more
contiguous uses, the Board of Supervisors may permit a
reduction of the aggregate amount of required parking based
upon a determination that greater efficiency is effected by joint
use of a common parking area, but in such case the required
number of off-street parking spaces shall not be reduced by
more than 25%.
(c) This reduction may occur in conjunction with or in lieu of
Subsection F(1), Reserve parking.
(5) Common Parking District. Common parking shall be permitted
without limitation for uses located within the Common Parking
District as defined in the Towamencin Village Land Use and Design
Manual. In the Common Parking District 100% of the required
parking spaces may be permitted on another site located within the
Common Parking District. However, a common parking facility shall
not be permitted as a principal use on a lot within the Common
Parking District.
G. Mix of residential and nonresidential uses.
(1) In those sectors permitted by this chapter, a mix of residential and
nonresidential uses is encouraged, particularly when integrated
within the same building complex.
(2) Provision of residential use above the first floor in commercial and
business settings when authorized by § 153-416I of the Zoning
Ordinance is permitted without requirement for any additional
open space.
H. Conditional use criteria. In addition to the provisions of Article X of the
Zoning Ordinance, the following additional criteria shall apply in
considering the approval or denial of conditional use applications in this
district:
(1) Streets and circulation. The location of new streets, sight access,
driveways and pedestrian networks shall comply with the specific
requirements identified within this chapter and the Towamencin
Village Land Use and Design Manual,220 except as may be modified
by the Board of Supervisors as part of the conditional use approval.
[Amended 10-8-2008 by Ord. No. 08-06]
(2) Existing streets abutting a parcel of land proposed for development
shall be improved in accordance with the requirements of the
Towamencin Village Land Use and Design Manual, a Townshipwide
traffic study, or the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance,221 whichever shall control as determined
by the Board of Supervisors.

221. Editor's Note: See Ch. 136, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 153-416 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-416
1:808
(3) Parking, service, loading, and refuse areas; pedestrian circulation;
outdoor lighting, street, parking lot and sidewalk lighting, and
lighting fixtures and poles; mass transit stops, plazas and open
space; landscaping; and planted buffer requirements shall be in
accordance with requirements established by the Towamencin
Village Land Use and Design Manual.
(4) Design guidelines. In order to ensure all design elements within the
Towamencin Village Overlay District (which may develop in
different areas over a period of years) will be uniform, the following
design elements shall specifically be in accordance with the
Towamencin Village Land Use and Design Manual:
(a) Each applicant shall submit architectural drawings showing
concepts for facades, roof design, and materials for buildings
and structured parking facilities, and incorporate specific
design standards in order to qualify for conditional use
approval.
(b) These design standards shall include, but may not necessarily
be limited to, building and streetscape elements such as the
type of lighting, sidewalk design, street furniture, street signs,
and architectural details and facade materials.
(c) In addition, the applicant shall incorporate architectural
performance standards such as screening of parking facilities,
loading areas, and all mechanical equipment; the continuity of
store fronts and entrance doorways on specific streets; the
massing of buildings to reinforce the design of an urban space;
and sign control.
(5) The Board of Supervisors may at its discretion waive or modify
requirements contained within the Towamencin Village Land Use
and Design Manual222 upon determination that strict compliance
would not further the purpose and intent of the chapter. However,
waivers shall not apply to sector uses, parking requirements
(except structured parking, which may be waived or modified), and
height requirements. [Amended 10-8-2008 by Ord. No. 08-06]

Overlay District shall comply with Article VIII of the Towamencin
Township Code224 unless otherwise waived by the Board of Supervisors
through the conditional use process per § 153-419G(6). Sign design

building and site design on the public realm, particularly streets,
sidewalks, trails and access to public open space. The design shall
include curbside management, internal parking circulation, and

(5) Steep slopes. It is the primary intent of this section to identify and
mitigate certain hazards to the community's health, safety and
§ 153-616 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-616
1:895
welfare caused by development on slopes in excess of 15%, herein
defined as steep slopes. Secondarily, it is intended to protect these
environmentally sensitive areas pursuant to Article I, Section 27,
of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which
states that people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the
preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of
the environment.
(a) The section is specifically intended to insure the following:
[1] All structures will be located away from steep slopes on
safe, stable grounds away from possible landslide or
erosion activities.
[2] All roads and driveways will have safe and stable side
slopes or shoulders.
[3] Development activities such as grading and stripping of
vegetation will be minimized on steep slopes to reduce
accelerated stormwater runoff and soil erosion of the
slope, thereby preserving water quality.
[4] Environmentally sensitive native wildlife habitats (such as
woodlands) located on steep slopes will be minimally
affected by development.
[5] The visual integrity of steep slopes areas will be
maintained throughout development.
(b) Application of regulation to all districts. These regulations
shall apply to all districts on lands having any of the following
characteristics:
[1] Slopes greater than 15% as determined by measurements
by registered professional engineers, surveyors, or
landscape architects, using accepted engineering
practices.
[2] Soil types classified as "stony land, steep" by that
document entitled Soil Survey of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, prepared by the United States Department
of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, dated April
1967, a copy of which is on file in the offices of the
Township.
[3] Slopes greater than 15% as delineated on the maps made a
part of the Soil Survey of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, provided, however, that in the event of a
conflict between topographic measurements prepared in
accordance with Subsection B(5)(b)[1] above and the soils
map, the measurements shall control.
§ 153-616 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-616
1:896
(c) No stripping of vegetation, grading, or construction of any kind
shall take place in steep slope areas except in conformance
with the following regulations:
[1] All structures and other impervious surfaces shall be set
back 25 feet from the top of steep slope areas. This twentyfive-
foot setback shall be covered in permanent vegetation
in order to minimize the effect of accelerated stormwater
runoff on the steep slope and to minimize the likelihood of
tectonic action on the structure or surface.
[2] Structures and impervious surfaces shall be set back a
sufficient distance from the bottom of steep slope areas to
insure proper grading and drainage around the structure
or surface without encroachment on the steep slope areas.
[3] Underground utilities may cross steep slope areas given
no other reasonable alternative exists, as determined by
the Township Engineer, and grading and clearing will be
kept to the minimum necessary. Any steep slope areas
disturbed in the construction of underground utilities shall
be regraded and revegetated to match previously existing
conditions immediately after construction.
[4] Roads, driveways, and parking facilities may be permitted
by the Board of Supervisors as a conditional use, provided
the following conditions are met:
[a] There is no other reasonable alternative to provide
access or parking outside steep slope areas.
[b] The extent of the disturbance required for the road,
driveway, or parking facility is consistent with the
intent of this chapter.
[c] The disturbance proposed is the minimum necessary
and all possible measures to reduce the amount of
disturbance are employed.
[d] The steep slope area disturbed will be immediately
revegetated to a condition reasonably similar to
previously existing conditions.
[e] No side grades created by the road or driveway shall
be greater than 25%.
(d) Design standards in steep slope areas. Steep slope areas shall
be delineated in the field prior to any clearing or construction.
A temporary physical barrier such as a snow fence shall be
erected around steep slope areas prior to major clearing and
construction. The barrier shall be placed to prevent
encroachment by construction vehicles on the steep slope area
§ 153-616 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-616
1:897
and shall remain in place until construction is completed. The
steep slope area shall not be disturbed in any way including the
use of the area for refuse, fill, or top soil or materials, storage,
or any temporary uses during construction. Any accidentally
disrupted area shall be immediately returned to match the
previously existing condition (i.e., grades and vegetative
cover).
(e) Liability. Neither the approval of any proposed subdivision or
land development by any officer, employee or agency of the
Township of Towamencin, nor the grant of any subdivision
approval by the Board of Supervisors of the Township of
Towamencin, shall constitute a representation, guarantee or
warranty of any kind of the Township of Towamencin or by any
of its officers, employees, agencies or members of its agencies
of the safety or practicality of the proposed subdivision and
use, and such approval or grant of approval shall not create
any liability on the part of the Township of Towamencin or its
officers, employees, agencies or members of its agencies.
(f) Areas with restrictions due to steep slopes shall be left
undisturbed to the extent specified herein and not occupied by
structures, driveways, on-lot septic systems or other
improvements.
(6) Woodlands. Woodlands as defined by this chapter shall be subject
to the restrictions specified herein.
(a) Mature trees with a circumference of 60 inches or greater
measured 14 inches above ground shall be identified and
preserved, unless the Board of Supervisors agrees to a
different disposition.
(7) Tree protection area. The tree protection area refers to the area
around woodlands which are to be protected under the provisions
of this chapter. The purpose is to ensure that trees which are to be
protected do not suffer damage during the development. The tree
protection area is an area radial to the trunk of a tree and shall be
15 feet from the trunk of the tree to be retained, or the distance
from the trunk to the drip-line (the line marking the outer edge of
the branches of the tree), whichever is greater. Where there is a
group of trees or woodlands, the tree protection area shall be an
area encompassing the protection areas for the individual trees.
(a) A tree protection area shall be designated around the area(s)
of woodlands to be protected, within which no construction
activity or grading shall occur.
(b) The tree protection area shall be fenced during construction
activities to protect the area from unauthorized grading or tree
removal.

(4) Support structure safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
proposed wireless communications facility and support structure
are safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected
by support structure failure, falling ice, or other hazards or radio
frequency interference. All support structures shall be fitted with
or protected by anticlimbing devices, as approved by the
manufacturers. The applicant shall submit certification from a
Pennsylvania-registered professional engineer that a proposed
communications tower will be designed and constructed in
accordance with the current structural standards for the type of
wireless communications facility proposed, published by the
Electrical Industrial Association/Telecommunications Industry
Association, and applicable requirements of the Pennsylvania
Building Code, the Building Code adopted by the Township, and
other applicable federal, state and municipal regulations,
resolutions and ordinances.
(5) Attached wireless communications facilities shall be designed so as
to blend into the existing attachment structure to the extent
feasible, including placement in a location which is consistent with
proper functioning of the wireless communications facility and use
of compatible or neutral colors.
(6) Attached wireless communications facilities which have aesthetic
impacts that are not able to be reasonably mitigated by placement
and color solutions may be required to be screened in a reasonable
and achievable manner.
(7) Wireless communications facilities with support structure shall be
designed so as to blend in with the existing surroundings to the
extent feasible, including the use of compatible colors and
disguised structures such as man-made trees, clock towers, bell
steeples, light poles and similar alternative design mounting
structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or
support structures.
(8) Equipment facilities shall, to the extent practical, use materials,
colors and textures that blend in with the natural setting and built
environment.
(9) The applicant shall provide evidence satisfactory to Township
Zoning Officer that the camouflaging of the wireless
communications facility effectively minimizes its visual impact and
blends with its surroundings prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
(10) Effort to locate on existing structures. Before making application
for any wireless communications facility to be located on a new
support structure, the applicant shall demonstrate that a good faith
§ 153-621 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-621
1:925
effort was made to mount an antenna array or micro facility,
whichever is applicable, on an existing structure. The applicant
shall submit proof that it contacted the owners of tall structures
within a one-mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission
to install the facility on those structures, offered market
compensation to such owners, and was denied. These structures
would include smokestacks, water towers, tall buildings, existing
or proposed support structures of other cellular communications
companies, high tension power line towers, other communications
towers (fire, police, etc.), and other tall structures.
(11) Plan. The applicant shall provide a plan for all wireless
communications facilities showing the antenna array, micro facility
(if applicable), support structure, building (or equipment facility),

proposed facility and adjacent structures and property lines.
(12) Other standards. Comply with all other standards of approval for
all wireless communications facilities as set forth in this section.
(13) Abandoned facilities. The applicant shall agree to remove
abandoned wireless communications facility improvements as set
forth in § 153-621E(28).
(14) Conditions for conditional uses. When granting a conditional use,
the Township may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this section, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this section. Such
conditions and safeguards may include, but need not be limited to,
conditions on height, camouflaging method, particular location on
a lot, fencing and other measures that implement the purposes of
this section.
N. Nonconforming uses. [Added 8-26-2016 by Ord. No. 15-12]
(1) No expansion of nonconforming use. Antenna arrays, micro
facilities and any other wireless communications facilities which
are installed or attached to existing structures in accordance with
the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the
expansion of a nonconforming use or structure but shall rather
comply with all the requirements for a separate and distinct use
under the provisions of the Township's zoning, subdivision and land
development ordinances.
(2) Preexisting support structures. Preexisting, nonconforming
support structures shall be allowed to continue their usage as they
presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement with
a new support structure of like construction and height) shall be
permitted on such preexisting support structures. New
construction other than routine maintenance on a preexisting

may be rebuilt without having to first obtain a new, conditional use
approval. The type, height, and specific location of the rebuilt
support structure, antenna array and micro facility on site shall be
of the same type and intensity as the original facility approval.
Building permits to rebuild the facility shall comply with then
applicable building codes and shall be obtained within 120 days
from the date the facility is damaged or, if no permit is obtained or
if said permit expires, the support structure, antenna array or
micro facility shall be deemed abandoned as specified in
§ 163-621E(28).
O. Modification of and/or variances from the requirements of this section.
(1) Variances from the design, dimensional and appearance criteria of
this section may be granted by Township during the conditional use
process upon satisfactory demonstration of the same type of severe
and unnecessary hardship as would be required for an applicant
seeing a variance from the Township Zoning Hearing Board.
(2) A request for a variance to permit the location of any wireless
communications facility anywhere other than as permitted by this
section may be granted only by the Township Zoning Hearing
Board.
P. Conflicts. Where the provisions of this section are in conflict with the
regulations of any underlying zoning district, the provisions of this
section shall control.
Q. Violations and penalties.
(1) Any person who shall erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair,
convert, attach or maintain any wireless communications facility in
violation of the terms of this section, or who, being the owner or
agent of the owner of any lot, tract or parcel of land shall suffer or
permit another to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair,

reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, attached or
maintained in violation of this section or any regulations made
pursuant hereto, an authorized official of the Township, in addition
§ 153-621 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-621
1:927
to other remedies, may institute in the name of the Township
any appropriate action or proceeding, whether by legal process
or otherwise, to prevent such unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance,
attachment or use, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, to
prevent the use of such facility and/or to prevent any illegal act,
conduct, business or use in or about such facility.

the parking and driveway provisions of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance of Towamencin Township,244 as last amended.
§ 153-701. Exemptions.
Structures and uses in existence at the date of adoption of this chapter
shall not be subject to the requirements of this article providing that the
kind and/or extent of use is not changed, altered, extended or enlarged and
provided further that any parking facility now serving such structures or
uses shall not in the future be reduced below its current extent or below
what is now required by this chapter.
§ 153-702. Expansion, alteration or change in use.
Whenever there is an alteration or change in use which increases the
parking requirements, the total additional parking required for the
alteration, change or extension shall be provided in accordance with this
chapter.
§ 153-703. Shared parking for commercial developments.
Two or more uses in any single business or commercial development may
provide for required parking in a common parking lot if the total of the
spaces provided is not less than the sum of the spaces required for each
use individually, provided that, however, the number of spaces required in
a common parking facility may be reduced below this total if it can be
adequately demonstrated to the Board of Supervisors that the hours or days
of peak parking needed for the uses are so different that a lower total
will provide adequately for all uses served by the facility. Area for spaces
which are required, but not built, under this provision shall be reserved in
accordance with § 153-704 below.
§ 153-704. Reserved areas.
The Board of Supervisors may approve, as a conditional use, the placing
of open space in "reserve" for use as future parking areas. Under such
conditional use, the applicant would be permitted to construct reduced
parking facilities in accordance with his demonstrated need provided that
space is reserved for the construction of the necessary parking facilities
needed to satisfy the full parking requirement of this chapter and that the

areas for required buffer yards, setbacks, or areas which would
otherwise be unsuitable for parking spaces due to the physical
characteristics of the land, or other requirements of this chapter or the
Towamencin Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance,245 as last amended.
E. The parking area which is reserved shall be located and have
characteristics so as to provide amendable open space should it be
determined in the future that additional parking spaces are not
required. The developer shall provide a landscaping plan for the
reserve area with the conditional use plan submission.
F. The applicant shall prepare, to the satisfaction of the Township
Solicitor, a covenant to be attached to the property deed establishing
the reserved parking area as open space until such time as the Board of
Supervisors may require the construction of said reserved area as
parking in accordance with the conditional use plan.
G. The applicant shall submit, to the satisfaction of the Township Solicitor,
a letter of credit or performance bond from an acceptable financial
institution in the amount required to construct the reserved parking as

ARTICLE IX
Nonconformities
§ 153-900. Purpose.
This article is intended to recognize the property rights of owners of
nonconforming structures and uses to the extent required by law, while
also recognizing the legitimate desire of the Township to minimize
nonconformities, since they are in derogation of the comprehensive
planning scheme reflected in this chapter.
§ 153-901. Continuation.
The lawful use of a building or structure or the lawful use of any land
as existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of this chapter or
amendment thereto, may be continued although such use or structure does
not conform to the provisions of this chapter provided said use or structure
is not altered, expanded, enlarged or extended except as hereinafter
provided.
§ 153-902. Isolated lots.
Any nonconforming lot may be used as a lot for purposes of zoning provided:
§ 153-903. Merger of nonconforming lots.
Where two or more adjacent lots, one or more of which is nonconforming,
are owned by the same owner, and the ownership of the lots is concurrent,
such lots shall be deemed to be merged into a single conforming or more
A. The subject lot is and has been held in single and separate ownership
from the date at which said lot originally became nonconforming. "Held
in single and separate ownership" for the purpose of this section means
that the current or former owner(s) of the subject lot have not, and do
not, own or have any interest whatsoever in any adjoining property to
the lot in question.
B. That the owner of an isolated lot has made a good faith attempt to sell
the nonconforming lot to an adjoining property, or has offered to
purchase adjoining land to make the isolated nonconforming lot
conforming or more closely conforming to the provisions of this chapter.
C. In the event different use types and associated lot sizes are permitted
within the zoning district in question, only the use or uses permitted on
the smallest or most closely related lot area and/or dimension as the
existing undersized lot shall be permitted by right. All other uses shall
only be permitted by special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board.
D. All structures proposed upon an existing nonconforming lot shall meet
all other requirements for the use and zone it which it is located
including but not necessarily limited to building and lot coverage,
yards, setbacks, height and parking requirements.
§ 153-900 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-903
1:969
closely conforming lot. For the purpose of this chapter, the merger of
nonconforming lots shall occur upon the date said lots became
nonconforming or upon the date when adjacent property is purchased by
the same owner, whichever date shall first occur.
§ 153-904. Cessation of use; abandonment.
Absent documentation to the contrary as provided in § 153-905 below,
whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a continuous
period of one year there is a rebuttable presumption of the intent to
abandon said nonconforming use. Upon the abandonment of a
nonconforming use, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished. Any
subsequent use of such land or structure shall be in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 153-905. Resumption of nonconforming use.
In the event that a cessation of a nonconforming use occurs for a period
exceeding one year, the owner shall have the burden of proof to clearly
demonstrate to the Zoning Officer or Zoning Hearing Board upon appeal,
that there was no intent to abandon said use, in which case, the existing
use type and extent of use lawfully established prior to the presumed
cessation of use shall be registered with the Zoning Officer and may then be
continued as provided herein.
§ 153-906. Changes in nonconforming use.
Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be permitted
to revert to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be changed to
another nonconforming use only under the following conditions:
§ 153-907. Expansion of nonconforming use or structure.
Any lawful nonconforming use or structure or portion thereof may be
expanded, provided:
A. All changes shall be permitted only by special exception of the Zoning
Hearing Board.
B. The applicant shall show that the proposed use will be more conforming
and/or less objectionable in external effects than the existing
nonconforming use with respect to:
(1) Traffic generation and congestion including truck, passenger car
and pedestrian traffic.
(2) General nuisance.
(3) Appearance and function.
A. The proposed expansion shall take place only upon the lot held in single
and separate ownership as existed on the date the use became
§ 153-903 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-907
1:970
§ 153-908. Damage or destruction of building; reconstruction.
A nonconforming structure or any structure containing a nonconforming
use which has been damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, accident, or
calamity (as contrasted to deterioration due to time or neglect) may be
reconstructed and used for the nonconforming use, provided that:
§ 153-909. Condemnation of building.
A nonconforming building which has been legally condemned shall not be
rebuilt or used for nonconforming purposes.
§ 153-910. Repair and maintenance.
Normal and customary repairs and maintenance of a nonconforming
structure or use shall be permitted, provided such repair or maintenance
does not extend, expand, or increase the nonconformity.
§ 153-911. Registration of nonconforming uses.
The Zoning Officer may provide for the registration of all uses which are
nonconforming under the terms of this chapter within a reasonable time
nonconforming. A nonconforming use or structure shall be prohibited
from encroaching upon another parcel of land subsequently added to
the original parcel.
B. The area of such use or structure shall not be increased by more than
25% of the area of the use or structure as existed on the date it became
nonconforming.
C. Any and all expansions of a nonconforming use or structure shall
conform to all height, area, width, yard and coverage requirements for
the district in which said use or structure is located. A structure which
is nonconforming in terms of height shall not be extended to increase
the height.
D. Permission to extend a nonconforming use as described in this article
shall not be construed to mean that a new use or uses may be
established.
E. Structures or land uses that have reached their maximum expansion
allowance under previous ordinances are not eligible for additional
expansion under provision of this chapter.
A. The reconstructed structure shall not exceed in height, area and
volume the structure destroyed except that expansion may be made as
provided for herein.
B. Building reconstruction shall be started within one year from the date
the building was destroyed and shall be carried on without interruption
and completed in a timely manner.
§ 153-907 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-911
1:971
after the effective date of this chapter or upon appeal of a cessation of use.
The record of nonconforming uses shall certify, after inspection, the extent
and kind of use and disposition of the structure and land. Each occupant or
owner of a premises used as a nonconforming use or structure shall make
available such information as may be necessary to determine the extent and
nature of the nonconformity as established by this chapter.

§ 153-1000. Authority to grant conditional uses.
The Board of Supervisors may allow or deny conditional uses pursuant to
public notice and hearing and pursuant to express standards and criteria set

Supervisors.
§ 153-1002. Pending applications; effect of modified ordinances.
When an application for a conditional use has been filed with the Board of
Supervisors, and the subject matter of such application would ultimately

development, or other governing ordinance or plans shall affect the decision
on such application adversely to the applicant, and the applicant shall be
entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly
filed. Provided further, should such an application be approved by the
Board of Supervisors, the applicant shall be entitled to proceed with the
submission of either land development or subdivision plans within a period
of six months or longer as may be approved by the Board of Supervisors
following the date of such approval in accordance with the provisions of the

listed for the use or district, and all other applicable provisions of this
chapter and all other applicable ordinances and regulations. In
evaluating conditional use applications, the following standards shall
apply:
(1) The Board shall require that the proposed land use be made
compatible with the surrounding existing land uses. Conditions
controlling planting of shade trees, evergreen buffers and planted
berms may be imposed to create a buffer beyond the normal
requirements of this chapter if deemed necessary by the Board.
(2) The Board shall make favorable findings regarding all of the

§ 153-1110. Function of Board: variances and special exceptions.
H. Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under the preliminary
opinion section, Section 916.2, of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,255 as amended.
I. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Township
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and
stormwater management insofar as the same related to developments
not involving applications for subdivisions or land developments, as
defined by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.
A. Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary
hardship on the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this chapter. The Board may grant a variance provided that
all of the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
255. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 153-1107 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-1110
1:980
§ 153-1111. Hearings.
The Board shall conduct open public hearings and make Zoning Ordinance
decisions in accordance with the following requirements:
hardship is due to such conditions, and not to the circumstances
or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation at issue.
B. Special exceptions. Where this chapter has provided for stated special
exceptions to be granted or denied by the Board pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for
such special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria.
In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this
chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
chapter.
A. Public notice. Public notice as a prerequisite to the holding of a hearing
by the Board shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. [Amended
12-17-2003 by Ord. No. 03-09]
B. Fees. The Board of Supervisors may prescribe reasonable fees with
respect to hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said
hearings may include compensation for the members of the Zoning
Hearing Board, notice and advertising costs and necessary
administrative overhead connected with the hearing.

a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in
favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or
on the record to an extension of time. When a decision has been
rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the
Board to meet or render a decision as hereinafter provided, the
Board shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days from
the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same
manner as provided herein. If the Board shall fail to provide such
notice, the appellant may do so. Nothing in this section shall

§ 153-1111 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-1112
1:983
§ 153-1112. Board procedure and considerations.
In passing upon applications for special exceptions and variances the Board
shall consider the following factors as well as all relevant factors and
procedures specified in this chapter:
A. Technical assistance. The Zoning Hearing Board in considering any
matter within its jurisdiction may consult with the Towamencin
Planning Commission, the Montgomery County Planning Commission,
or any other specialist or groups of specialists having expert knowledge
of the matter under consideration, but need not be bound thereby.
B. Burden of proof. The applicant for a special exception or variance shall
have the burden of proving that his application falls within the provision
of the chapter and shall have the further burden of proving:
(1) That the special exception or variance, if authorized, will not alter
the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
(2) That the variance or special exception, if authorized, will not
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property.
(3) That the special exception or variance, if authorized, will not be
detrimental to the health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of
the Township or the community.
(4) That the special exception or variance, if authorized, will not result
in or aggravate existing, adverse or abnormal patterns of traffic
flow, nor cause an unwarranted impact on traffic at or near the
particular location involved in the application.
C. Standards for Board actions. In any instance where the Zoning Hearing
Board is required to render a land use decision, the Board shall, among
other things, give consideration to the following:
(1) Consider the suitability of the property for the use desired. Assure
itself that the proposed change is consistent with the spirit,
purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Determine that the proposed change will not substantially injure or
detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character
of the neighborhood and that the use of the property adjacent to
the area included in the proposed change or plan is adequately
safeguarded.
(3) Determine that the proposed change will serve the best interests of
the Township, the convenience of the community (where
applicable) and the public welfare.
(4) Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical,
efficient, and economical extension of public services and facilities
§ 153-1112 TOWAMENCIN CODE § 153-1112
1:984
such as public water, sewers, police and fire protection and public
schools.
(5) Consider the suitability of the proposed location of the use with
respect to probable effects upon highway traffic, and assure
adequate access arrangements in order to protect major streets
from undue congestion and hazard.
(6) Be guided in its study, review, and recommendation by sound
standards of land development practice where applicable.
(7) Impose such conditions, in addition to those required, as are
necessary to assure that the intent of the Zoning Ordinance is
complied with, which conditions may include, but are not limited to
harmonious design of buildings, planting and its maintenance as a
sight or sound screen, the minimizing of noxious, offensive or
hazardous elements, and the provision for adequate parking and
sanitation.
(8) Determine whether there are special circumstances or conditions
fully described in the findings applying to the land or buildings for
which the variance is sought, which justify that the application of
the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of such land or building.
(9) Determine whether the unique circumstances for which the
variance is sought were either created by the owner of the
property, or were due to, or the result of, general conditions in the
district in which the property is located.
(10) Consider the effects of the proposed change with respect to the
most appropriate use of land; conserving the value of land and
buildings; safety from fire, panic and other dangers; the
overcrowding of land; congestion of population; and the adequacy
of public and community services.
(11) Consider the compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable
future.
(12) Give full consideration to the size, scope, intent, and character of
the exception requested and assure the compatibility of the
proposed use with the spirit, purpose and intent of the
Comprehensive Plan, the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance,256 as last amended and the provisions of this chapter.
(13) Such other factors as may be relevant to achieving the purpose of
this chapter.

§ 153-1113. Time limitations.
All appeals from administrative determinations adverse to any landowner
or affected party shall be filed by the landowner or affected party with
the Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days after official notice of the
determination has been issued.
§ 153-1114. Mediation option.
A. Parties to proceedings authorized in this article may utilize mediation
as an aid in completing such proceedings. In proceedings before the
Zoning Hearing Board, in no case shall the Zoning Hearing Board
initiate mediation or participate as a mediating party. Mediation shall
supplement, not replace, those procedures in this article once they have
been formally initiated. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
expanding or limiting Township police powers or as modifying any
principles of substantive law. Applications for special exceptions and
variances are not appropriate for the mediation option and, therefore,
may not utilize this section.
B. Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the particulars of
each case, and the willingness of the parties to negotiate. The terms
and conditions of mediation are hereby set forth as follows:
(1) The cost of mediation shall be borne by the applicant.
(2) The parties shall agree on a mediator who shall have a working
knowledge of municipal land use and zoning and land development
procedures and demonstrated skills in mediation.
(3) Parties to proceedings under this application may select the
mediation option by sending written notice to the Zoning Hearing
Board of their intention to do so. Mediation shall be completed
within 90 days of the date of notification to the Board.
(4) The written notice to the Zoning Hearing Board indicating the
party's intent to mediate shall include a written consent signed by
all parties agreeing to the suspension of time limits otherwise
required by this chapter and the Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended, and by an applicant or Township decision-making body if
either is not a party to the mediation.
(5) All parties to the proceedings shall be identified in the notice to the
Board and shall be served notice of the party's intent to mediate. All
parties shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in any
mediation proceeding.
(6) Any mediation to which a Township entity is party shall be open to
the public.

§ 153-1115. Expiration. [Amended 12-19-2001 by Ord. No. 01-10]
Unless otherwise specified by the Zoning Hearing Board, a special
exception or variance, or specified by the Board of Supervisors for a
conditional use, such zoning relief shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain
a building permit in connection therewith within one year of the date of the
order of the Zoning Hearing Board, Board of Supervisors or court granting
such special exception, variance or conditional use. In those instances
where land development/subdivision approval is a necessary prerequisite
prior to obtaining a building permit, the special exception, variance, or
conditional use shall expire if the applicant fails to make a diligent effort
to obtain such land development/subdivision approval within six months
following the date of zoning approval. Upon receipt of land development
approval, the special exception, variance, or conditional use shall expire
if a building permit is not obtained within six months of the date of land
development approval.
(7) All mediated solutions must be in writing and signed by the parties
and become subject to review and approval by the appropriate
decision-making body pursuant to the authorized procedures set
forth in this chapter and the Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended.
(8) No offers or statements made in the mediated sessions, excluding
the final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as
evidence in any subsequent judicial or administrative proceeding.
