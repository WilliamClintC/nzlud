§ 76-1. Protection and emergency fees.
§ 76-2. Collection of fees.
A. The Middlesex Township Supervisors find that increasing costs of
providing adequate emergency and protection services, including
services resulting from extraordinary and dangerous occurrences and
hazardous material incidents and vehicle accidents and extrication,
seriously impairs the Middlesex Volunteer Fire Company's ability to
provide all necessary emergency and protection services.

establishes that the Middlesex Township Volunteer Fire Company adopt
a policy of reimbursement of expenses and costs incurred by the
Volunteer Fire Company in providing the services which they offer. The
schedule of reimbursement shall adequately reflect all emergency and
protection costs and expenses incurred and in no case shall be less than
the schedule set forth in § 76-3 below.
A. An officer designated by the Middlesex Volunteer Fire Company
rendering emergency and protection services shall collect all fees for
emergency and protection services and for other public safety. Such
fees may include and encompass all equipment, materials, maintenance
and overhead expenses and costs which shall constitute full
reimbursement to the Volunteer Fire Company for such services
actually rendered and as hereinafter authorized.
B. Within 30 days of the date of providing emergency protection services
or other public safety services as enumerated in § 76-3, the officer
designated by the Middlesex Volunteer Fire Company rendering the
service shall submit a bill for all costs, fees, charges and expenses
related to the provisions of such services to the owner or the property
owner's designated agent or representative, or manager of the fixed
facility or vehicle which caused the need for emergency and protection
services. All such bills shall be paid in full within 60 days of the receipt

Statutory Authorization
§ 84-1. Authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,33 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of the Township does hereby
order as follows.

General Provisions
§ 84-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 84-3. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development
anywhere within the Township unless a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator.
§ 84-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions; repeal of prior
floodplain ordinance.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply. Ordinance No. 43
is expressly repealed by the enactment of this chapter.
§ 84-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 84-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the Township, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
§ 84-2 EMERGENCY SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT § 84-6

not imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 84-18. Identification.
§ 84-19. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of the Township classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated August 2, 2018, and
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or
the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township and declared to
be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the Township
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
§ 84-18 EMERGENCY SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT § 84-19
76:81
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted in an
AE Zone without floodway, unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed development, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, would not result in an increase in
flood levels of more than one foot within the entire Township
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection regional
office.
C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the Township may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Township. In the
absence of any of the above data or documentation, the Township
may require elevation of the lowest floor to be at least three feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average
depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage
§ 84-19 MIDDLESEX CODE § 84-19
76:82
§ 84-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, the Township
shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 84-23B for situations where
FEMA notification is required.
§ 84-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Township, and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board of
Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 84-22. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the Township
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The Township shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and away from
structures on slopes.
E. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where the
Township has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.

from the Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When the Township proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments,
the Township shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.

or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading,
and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations
or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on
the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions
of land, including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs
or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent or more of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before
the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures
which have incurred substantial damage or cumulative substantial damage,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the Township,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the code adopted the International
Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by
§ 84-36 EMERGENCY SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT § 84-36

§ 89-10. Expiration of permit; extension
the Township. Evidence of approval from a state or county agency,
where required, shall also be provided.
F. If proposed grading, excavation or fill is located entirely or partially
within any identified floodplain area, a document, certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect, which states that the
proposed grading, excavation or fill has been adequately designed to
withstand the one-hundred-year flood elevations, pressure, velocities,
impact and uplift forces associated with the one-hundred-year flood and
that the plans adhere to the restrictions of this chapter. Such statement
shall include a description of the type and extent of measures which
have been incorporated into the design of the grading, excavation or
fill.
A. The grading administrator shall require that a geotechnical
engineering report be submitted by the applicant if the site is, has been,
or is likely to become hazardous to persons or property. The Coal
Resource Maps prepared by USGS, 1975, for the Greater Pittsburgh
Region (as well as the SCS Soil Survey for Butler County) shall be used
to locate hazardous areas. The report shall contain a detailed
description of the geological conditions of the site and shall include
conclusions and recommendations that will demonstrate the
relationship of the geological conditions to the proposed development,
including hazardous conditions, water resources, mineral resources
and environmental impact.
B. Where, due to special circumstances and conditions, compliance with
the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship, the
grading administrator may make such special reasonable exceptions
thereto, upon recommendation from the Township Engineer, as will not
be contrary to the public interest, and may impose such conditions as it
deems necessary to adequately protect the public interest.
A. Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and
void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced
within six months or is not completed within one year from the date of
issue, provided that the Township Manager may, if the permit holder
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented
work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant
a reasonable extension of time, and provided further that the
application for the extension of time is made before the date of
expiration of the permit.
B. Any physical changes from the original plan uncovered in the site
during the construction, such as surface water drainage, soil and
§ 89-8 MIDDLESEX CODE § 89-10
89:114
§ 89-11. Denial of permit.
Where, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, the work as proposed by
the applicant is likely to endanger any property or person or any street or
alley or create hazardous conditions, the grading permit shall be denied.
In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger property
or streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the Township Engineer
shall give due consideration to possible saturation by rains, earth
movements, runoff surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the
stratification and faulting of rock aquifers, springs and the nature and type
of the soil or rock.
§ 89-12. Permit and fees.
§ 89-13. Performance security.
bedrock dislocations, alteration of groundwater discharge or any other
natural or man-made modification which would tend to adversely affect
the basis upon which the permit was issued, must be immediately
reported to the grading administrator by the permit holder. If the
circumstances dictate, the grading administrator shall revoke the
permit or otherwise modify the conditions upon which the permit was
initially issued.
A. Before issuing a grading permit, the grading administrator shall collect
a permit fee. Fees will be consistent with the appropriate and
applicable fee resolution adopted by the Board of Supervisors and as
may be amended from time to time.
B. Before issuance of a grading permit, the applicant shall post all
necessary performance security, in accordance with § 89-13 of this
chapter.
C. The applicant will be responsible for all costs associated with the
approval of the permit. Such costs shall include, but are not limited to,
inspection, engineering, legal, and administrative.
A. The applicant shall provide a written estimate of the cost to complete
the complete scope of grading and remedial work in order to comply
with this chapter, as prepared and certified by an engineer. The
Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, may accept
or may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown.
B. As a condition of grading approval for projects having an estimated cost
of $25,000 or more, the applicant shall post a security acceptable to the
Township in the amount of 110% of the estimated cost to perform the
grading and remedial work.
C. As a condition of grading approval for projects having an estimated cost
of less than $25,000, the applicant shall post a security acceptable to
§ 89-10 GRADING, EXCAVATION AND FILL § 89-13
89:115
§ 89-14. Inspections.
the Township in the amount of 50% of the estimated cost to perform the
grading and remedial work.
D. No security shall be required if security is posted for construction and/
or site improvements which already covers the cost of grading and
other control facilities.
A. Application for the permit by the applicant shall constitute consent to
enter the site for inspections at any time. The grading administrator
shall, when requested by the permit holder, make the inspections
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
which has been completed or notify the permit holder wherein the same
fails to comply with the provisions of this article. Where it is found by
inspection that the soil or other conditions are not as stated or shown in
the application, the grading administrator may refuse to approve
further work until approval is obtained for a revised grading plan
conforming to existing conditions.
B. Plans for grading work bearing the approval of the Township Engineer
shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the grading work
and until the work has been approved.
C. The permit holder shall notify the grading administrator in order to
obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule and at
least 48 hours before the inspection is to be made. Before calling for
any inspection, the owner shall have the property line stakes set and
sufficient grade stakes set by a registered engineer or surveyor to
enable the grading administrator to verify the grading operation.
(1) Initial inspection: when work on the excavation or fill is about to be
commenced.
(2) Rough grading: when all rough grading has been completed.
(3) Drainage facilities: when drainage facilities which connect to or
shall become public facilities are to be installed and inspected
before such facilities are backfilled.
(4) Special structures: when excavations are complete for retaining
and crib walls when reinforcing steel is in place and before
concrete is poured.
(5) Final inspection: when all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures, has been completed.
D. If at any stage of the work the grading administrator shall determine by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger property or
streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the Township may
require as a condition to allowing the work to be done that such
§ 89-13 MIDDLESEX CODE § 89-14
89:116
§ 89-15. Working conditions.
The following general working conditions will apply to all grading sites:
§ 89-16. Excavations.
Standards for excavations shall be as follows:
reasonable safety precautions be taken as the grading administrator
considers advisable to avoid such likelihood of danger. Safety
precautions may include but shall not be limited to specifying a flatter
exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms,
temporary safety fencing, terracing, compaction or cribbing.
A. Dust control. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control will be exercised.
B. Cleanup. All soil washed or carried onto public streets during grading
operations shall be cleaned up immediately. Temporary driveway or
road surfaces shall be provided as soon as possible in accordance with
all local, state and federal laws. The owner of the property being graded
shall be responsible to protect and clean up lower properties of silt and
debris which have washed down onto the lower properties as a result of
the grading work on the higher property and to restore the property to
original condition.
C. Permit hours. The operation of heavy construction or excavation
machinery, including but not limited to bulldozers, high lifts, backhoes,
trucks, power shovels, pumps and jack hammers, and the operation of
equipment, such as saws and drills or any other type of machinery used
outside a structure, in conjunction with work requiring a building
permit, which causes a noise sufficient to disturb the peace and general
tranquility of the general public or any portion thereof, shall be
prohibited in the entire Township between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and
7:00 a.m., Monday through Saturday, and all day Sunday and on
federally designated legal holidays.
A. Maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be two horizontal to one
vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazards. However, upon a
determination by a governmental review agency or a registered soils
engineer that the properties of the types of soil on the site to be graded,
as identified by the soil survey, other standard surveys, geological
surveys or core borings, require special consideration, then maximum
slopes may then be determined as follows:
(1) Landslide-prone soils or unstable rock formations where existing
slopes are less than 25% shall have proposed cut slopes no steeper
than are recommended by a registered soils engineer. A document
signed and sealed by said engineer shall be forwarded to the
Township prior to approval of the grading permit. Soil survey map
symbols for landslide-prone soils are:
§ 89-14 GRADING, EXCAVATION AND FILL § 89-16
89:117
§ 89-17. Fills.
Standards for fills shall be as follows:
(a) UGD Urban Land. Guernsey complex, gently sloping 0% - 8%
slope.
(b) UGD Urban Land. Guernsey complex, moderately sloping 8% -
25% slope.
B. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed
under a grading permit, provided one or both of the following is
satisfied:
(1) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope steeper than the slope.
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support designed, signed and
sealed by a professional structural engineer and approved by the
grading administrator is provided to support the face of excavation.
C. The bottom edge of final slopes shall be set back a minimum of five feet
from adjacent property lines in order to permit the normal rounding of
the edge without encroaching on the abutting property or street and to
allow for location of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
D. Before commencing any excavation which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the person making the
excavation shall notify in writing the owners of the adjacent property or
buildings not less than 30 days before such excavation is to be made
that the proposed excavation is to be started. Copies of all such notices
shall be supplied to the grading administrator.
E. The grading administrator may require an excavation to be made with a
cut slope flatter than those specified above if he finds the material in
which the excavation is to be made is unusually subject to erosion, or if
other conditions exist which, under applicable engineering practice,
make such flatter cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
Excavations adjacent to any footing, foundation or structure shall not
extend below the minimum angle of repose or natural slope of the soil
under the nearest point of same unless such footing, foundation or
structure is first properly underpinned or otherwise protected against
settlement.
A. No fill shall be made in the Township which creates a slope steeper than
two horizontal to one vertical. However, the Township, on the advice
and recommendation of a registered soils engineer, may impose
conditions requiring that a fill be constructed with an exposed surface
flatter than two horizontal to one vertical if the soils engineer states
that, under the particular circumstances involved, such flatter surface
is necessary for stability and for the safety of persons and property.
§ 89-16 MIDDLESEX CODE § 89-17
89:118
B. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
(1) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time as
determined by the Township Engineer and specified on the grading
permit.
(2) Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill, including all embankments, planting and
seeding areas, to a minimum depth of six inches to effectively
conceal all materials used in the fill other than clean soil or earth.
Prior to spreading topsoil, the subgrade shall be scarified to a
depth of two inches to facilitate the bonding of the subsoil with the
topsoil. If the filling operation is intermittent, the Township
Engineer may require that the top and exposed surfaces of the fill
be so covered at the completion of each lift.
(3) No fill of any kind shall be placed over topsoil, trees, stumps or
other material which would create a nuisance, potential fire hazard
or sanitary problem such as decomposition which would attract
rodents, termites or other pests.
(4) Fill areas shall be prepared by removing organic material such as
vegetation and rubbish, and any other material determined by the
grading administrator to prevent proper compaction and stability.
C. Where fills are located so that earth movement may result in personal
injury or damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys or buildings, the
bearing value and stability of the material under proposed fills and
embankments shall be determined by subsurface investigation
performed by a soils engineer.

to erosion, scouring or settling.
(4) Be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, unless
substantiated data justifying steeper slopes are submitted to and
approved by the Township Engineer.
(5) Be used to the extent to which it does not adversely affect adjacent
properties.
A. When the topographic natural condition of the property is such that a
ground slope of two horizontal to one vertical is not feasible, the
grading administrator may consider the submission of a grading plan
showing a retaining wall and ground slope combination that would be
aesthetically acceptable.
B. Criteria for the acceptance of such a combination shall as a minimum
provide the following:
(1) That the retaining wall(s) not exceed a height of six feet, except
where there is a showing of extraordinary circumstances.
(2) If the plan incorporates terracing, the gradient of the slope
between retaining walls shall not exceed two horizontal to one
vertical, and that the horizontal distance between walls be at least
equal to the height of the retaining wall.

§ 97-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Middlesex Township Impact Fee
Program."
§ 97-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Middlesex Township Impact
Fee Program, including a Transportation Capital Improvements Plan, to
ensure that the transportation system is available and adequate to support
existing volumes of traffic and traffic projected to be generated by new
growth and development. To advance this objective, the Middlesex
Township Impact Fee Program shall be based upon the imposition of an
impact fee payable to the Township at the time of building permit issuance.
Additionally, the program identifies existing deficiencies due to pass
through trips and future trip generation attributable to new development.
The program will provide a continuing generation of funds necessary for
the Township to initiate and complete capital transportation improvements
as needed in support of new growth and development. Such a program
will involve participation by developers as well as local, state and federal
governments. Through the Impact Fee Program, the Township is
establishing a process whereby future traffic needs can be addressed in a
timely manner and the impact of increased traffic volumes can be minimized
to the extent possible.
§ 97-3. Findings.
The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that:
48.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 89-25 IMPACT FEES § 97-3
97:125
§ 97-4. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following words and terms shall have the
following meanings unless another meaning is plainly intended:
A. The Township is committed to the provision of a transportation system
at service levels necessary to support residential and nonresidential
growth and development.
B. Transportation service levels will be provided by the Township utilizing
funds allocated via the capital budget, capital improvements programs
and impact fees.
C. The aggregation of development in the defined transportation service
areas intensifies the demand for transportation improvements designed
to accommodate traffic volumes at a "D" level of service for Township
intersections and a "C" level of service for Township road segments as
defined by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy
of Science, which is the minimum acceptable level of service to
accommodate such development and the intensity thereof.
D. The development potential of properties in the defined transportation
service areas is reflected in the Roadway Sufficiency Analysis adopted
by Resolution No. 04-32 and the Township's Comprehensive Plan and is
implemented via Chapter 150, Subdivision and Land Development, and
Chapter 175, Zoning.
E. To the extent that new development in the transportation service areas
places demands upon the transportation system, those demands should
be satisfied by the establishment of an Impact Fee Program that
distributes the responsibility for financing the provision of such
transportation facilities among the Township, state and federal
governments, and developers.
F. The amount of the impact fee to be imposed shall be calculated in
accordance with the provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53
P.S. § 10501-A et seq., as amended, and this chapter, applying the
engineering standards set forth in Trip Generation, 6th Ed. 1997 Vols.
1-3, Institute of Transportation Engineering, and any amendments or
future editions thereof.49
G. The Township hereby finds and declares that an impact fee imposed
upon new development, in order to assist in the financing of specified
major transportation capital improvements in the defined
transportation service areas, the demand for which has been quantified
through the application of land use assumptions provided by the Impact
Fee Advisory Committee appointed by the Board of Supervisors, is in
the best interest of the Township and its residents.

this chapter and shall not be construed to provide a two-trip credit to
new development.
C. This chapter shall not apply to public schools, or buildings associated
therewith, or to the Township of Middlesex, Saxonburg Area Authority,
or any other Township agency or authority. Schools and local
government agencies serve an overriding public interest, warranting an
exemption from impact fees.
A. The unit cost per trip is derived from the Transportation Capital
Improvement Plan and may be amended as transportation needs dictate
and as directed by the Board of Supervisors.
B. The impact fee imposed by this chapter upon all new development shall
be determined by applying the unit improvement cost to the p.m. peakhour
trips generated by a project as identified in Trip Generation, 6th
Edition 1997 Vols. 1-3, The Institute of Transportation Engineers, and
any amendments or future editions thereof, or by a special
transportation study pursuant to § 97-10. To determine the fee for a
specific use, the p.m. peak-hour trip generation rate for the proposed
use shall be multiplied by the unit improvement cost rate in each
transportation service area.
C. If the development for which a building permit is sought contains a mix
of uses, the applicant must separately calculate the impact fee due for
each type of development.
A. Applicability. An additional impact fee shall be imposed upon new
developments that generate 1,000 or more p.m. peak-hour trips, net of
pass-by trips as defined by Trip Generation 6th Ed. 1997 Vols. 1-3,
Institute of Transportation Engineers, and any amendments or future
editions thereof. This section is in addition to the impact fee calculated
under this chapter.
B. Traffic study. An applicant for a new development that generates 1,000
or more p.m. peak-hour trips shall be required to perform a traffic
analysis of development traffic impact on highways, roads or streets
outside the transportation service area in which the new development
is located, but within the boundaries of the Township. Any highways,
roads or streets, or parts thereof, outside the transportation service
area that will accommodate 10% or more of the new development

traffic and 100 or more new p.m. peak-hour trips may be required to
be studied. The traffic study is to be conducted in accordance with
the Township requirements as determined by the Township Traffic
Engineer.
C. Mitigation. Applicants for new development that generates 1,000 or
more new p.m. peak-hour trips, less pass-by trips, will be required to
mitigate the traffic impact of the new development on the affected
roads, highways and streets per the traffic study to maintain the
predevelopment conditions.
A. Applicability of this section. The Board of Supervisors may permit or
require a new development to perform a special transportation study to
document actual trip generation from a particular use. The instances
when a special transportation study can or must be performed are
limited to instances where:
(1) The Township requests a special transportation study;
(2) No "R" value or fitted curve equation is provided for the use in the
most recent version of Trip Generation 6th Ed. 1997 Vols. 1-3, The
Institute of Traffic Engineers;
(3) The use is not represented in any amendments or future editions of
Trip Generation 6th Ed. 1997 Vols. 1-3, The Institute of Traffic
Engineers.
B. Guidelines for conducting a special transportation study. Special
transportation studies must be conducted in accordance with the
guidance in the most recent version of Trip Generation 6th Ed. 1997
Vols. 1-3, The Institute of Traffic Engineers. The new development is

B. Establishment and maintenance of accounts. The Township Manager
shall establish interest-bearing trust fund accounts created solely for
impact fees and shall maintain records whereby impact fees collected
are segregated by transportation service areas. All interest earned shall
become the funds of that account. Impact fees generated from new
development may only be expended for transportation capital
improvements identified as being funded by impact fees under the
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan in a particular
transportation service area, except as provided in § 97-13.
C. Maintenance of records. The Township Manager shall maintain and
keep adequate financial records for each such account that will show
the source and disbursement of all revenues, that will account for all
moneys received and that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds
from each account will be used solely and exclusively for the provision
of projects specified in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
for the particular transportation service area.
D. Annual accounting. The Township will provide that an annual
accounting is made for any account containing impact fee proceeds and
earned interest. The accounting shall include the total funds collected,
the source for the funds collected, the total amount of interest accruing
on such funds and the amount of funds expended on specific
transportation improvements. Notice of the availability of the results of
the accounting will be included and published as part of the Township's
annual audit. A copy will also be provided to the Impact Fee Advisory
Committee.
A. Role of the Impact Fee Advisory Committee. The Impact Fee Advisory
Committee, or Advisory Committee, is a committee formed pursuant to
the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., as amended,
to serve in an advisory capacity to the Board of Supervisors. The
Advisory Committee has as its duties:52
(1) To make recommendations, with respect to land use assumptions,
on the development of comprehensive road improvements and
impact fees;
(2) To make recommendations to approve, disapprove or modify a
capital improvement program by preparing a written report
containing these recommendations to the Township;
(3) To monitor and evaluate the implementation of a capital
improvements program and the assessment of impact fees and
report annually to the Township with respect to the same;

The Board of Supervisors may request, no more than annually, the
Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on the
transportation capital improvements or impact fee charges based only
on:
(1) Subsequent new development which has occurred in the Township;
(2) Completion of capital improvements in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan;
(3) Unavoidable delays in construction of capital improvements
contained in the plan beyond the Township's control or
responsibility;
(4) Significant changes in the land use assumptions;
(5) Changes in the estimated costs of the transportation improvements
proposed which may be recalculated by applying the construction
cost index as published in the American City/County Magazine or
the Engineering News Record;
(6) Significant changes in the projected revenue from sources listed.
A. The applicant has provided written consent to use its collected impact
fees for specific transportation projects which are not included in the
Transportation Capital Improvement Plan;
B. The alternative transportation project, whether highway or multimodal,
has as its purpose the reduction of traffic congestion or the
removal of vehicle trips from the roadway network;
C. The Township amends its Transportation Capital Improvements Plan
components required by Section 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the Municipalities
§ 97-12 MIDDLESEX CODE § 97-13
97:132
§ 97-14. Method of payment.
Payment of the impact fee shall be made by the new development prior to
the issuance of a building permit by the Township to the new development
for development on the applicable site.
§ 97-15. Credit against impact fee.
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(vi), to provide replacement of
the collected impact fees transferred to transportation projects outside
the approved Transportation Capital Improvements Plan from sources
other than impact fees or developer contributions within three years
of completion of the alternative projects to which the transferred fees
were applied.
A. A traffic generator is entitled to a credit against the impact fee in the
amount of the fair market value of any land dedicated by the applicant
to the Township for future right-of-way, realignment or widening of any
existing roadways or for the value of any construction of road
improvements contained in the Transportation Capital Improvement
Plan which is performed at the applicant's expense. The amount of such
credit for any capital improvement constructed shall be the amount
allocated in the capital improvement program, including contingency
factors for such work. The fair market value of any land dedicated by
the applicant shall be determined as of the date of the submission of the
land development or subdivision application to the Township.
B. Any new development which performs, at its own expense, off-site
improvements as defined by this chapter shall be eligible for a credit
toward the impact fee otherwise due in the amount of the actual cost of
such off-site improvements as approved by the Township Engineer.
Such credit shall not exceed the amount of the impact fee. In order for a
new development to be eligible for this credit it must announce the
intent to perform off-site improvements during the subdivision or land
development approval process. The announcement must be in writing
and must set forth the off-site improvement project for which the traffic
generator is seeking credit. The traffic generator must enter into an
agreement with the Township prior to the issuance of any building
permit. The agreement must establish the estimated cost of the
improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the
improvement, guarantee that the improvement be completed to
Township and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards
and design criteria, and such other terms and conditions as deemed
necessary by the Township. The Township must review the
improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the
improvement is an eligible improvement and determine the amount of
the applicable credit for such improvement to be applied to the
otherwise applicable impact fee prior to issuance of any building
permit. In no event may the Township provide a credit that is greater
than the applicable impact fee. If, however, the amount of the credit is
§ 97-13 IMPACT FEES § 97-15
97:133
§ 97-16. Refunds.
calculated to be greater than the amount of the impact fee due, the
new development may utilize such excess credit toward the impact fees
imposed on other building permits for development on the same site
and in the same ownership.
C. The Township may provide a credit against impact fees for the value of
any construction projects that are not contained in the adopted
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan which are performed at the
traffic generator's expense, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant has provided written consent to a credit of its
collected impact fees for specific transportation projects which are
not included in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan;
(2) The alternative transportation project, whether highway or multimodal,
has as its purpose the reduction of traffic congestion or the
removal of vehicle trips from the roadway network;
(3) The Township amends its Transportation Capital Improvements
Plan components required by Section 504-A(e)(1)(vi) of the
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10504-A(e)(1)(vi), to
provide replacement of the credited impact fees transferred to
transportation projects outside the approved Transportation
Capital Improvements Plan from sources other than impact fees or
developer contributions within three years of completion of the
alternative projects to which the transferred fees were applied.
A. The payor of the impact fee may apply for a refund of appropriate share
of any such fee and any interest earned from the date of payment if:
(1) The Township has failed to commence any transportation service
area road improvements within three years of the scheduled
construction date set forth in the Transportation Capital
Improvements Plan.
(2) The new development for which impact fees were paid is not
commenced prior to the expiration of a building permit issued for
the new development within the time limits established by
applicable building codes; or the project for which a building
permit has been issued has been altered resulting in a decrease in
the amount of the impact fee due.
(3) If upon completion of any road improvements project the actual
expenditures are less than 95% of the costs allocable to the fee paid
within the transportation service area in which the road
improvement was adopted, the municipality shall refund to the
payer the pro-rata difference between the budgeted costs and the
actual expenditures, including interest from the date of payment.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 144-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Middlesex Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 144-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of Middlesex Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of Middlesex Township and all the
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain townships to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These townships are required to
obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm
sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES).
§ 144-1 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-2
140:207
§ 144-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Middlesex Township, Butler County, by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits described in § 144-2 of this chapter through
provisions intended to:
§ 144-4. Statutory authority.
G. Nonstormwater discharges to Township separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.

development is to take place in stages.
(2) For developments taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
(3) For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
G. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the applicant must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will result from the
concentrated discharge.
§ 144-11 MIDDLESEX CODE § 144-11
140:224
(1) The applicant must provide an easement for proposed concentrated
flow across adjacent properties to a drainage way or public right-ofway.
(2) Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
H. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
I. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
(with a minimum width of 20 feet and include the one-hundred-year
water surface) shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
maintenance, including mowing of vegetation within the easement may
be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
J. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainage ways
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.
K. Any stormwater management facilities or any facilities that constitute
water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream

in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (including wetlands),
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility
of the applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.

140:225
§ 144-12. Exemptions/modifications.
N. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil
conditions and geology permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
O. Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the site, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this
chapter.
P. The design of facilities over karst shall include an evaluation and
implementation of measures to minimize adverse effects.
Q. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers,
or roadside ditches in order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
the Township shall permit it on a case-by-case basis.
R. Applicants are encouraged to use low-impact development practices to
reduce the costs of complying with the requirements of this chapter and
the state water quality requirements.

requirements of this chapter if documentation can be provided that a
downstream man-made water body (i.e., reservoir, lake, or man-made
wetlands) has been designed or modified to address the potential
stormwater flooding impacts of the proposed development.
G. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. The Township may accept alternative stormwater management
controls under this section provided that:
(1) The Township, in consultation with the PADEP (or delegated
authority), determines that meeting the volume control
requirements (See § 144-14) is not possible or places an undue
hardship on the applicant.
(2) The alternative controls are documented to be acceptable to PADEP
(or delegated authority) for NPDES requirements pertaining to
post-construction stormwater management requirements.

§ 144-14. Volume controls.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B100 of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the applicant
may select either method on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures
associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e. it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
100. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 144-14 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-14
140:231
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration
tests shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
Notification of the Township shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either § 144-14B(1) or (2), the following procedure
shall be used:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided
to justify the decision to not use infiltration BMPs:
[1] Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and
test locations.
[2] An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water occurring on the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative
shall identify depth to seasonal high-water tables and
depth to bedrock, and provide a description of all
subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive
layers, geology, etc.) that influence the direction and rate
of subsurface water movement.
[3] A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to
annual aquifer recharge shall be made, along with
identification of any restrictions or limitations associated
with the use of engineered infiltration facilities.
[4] The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
a professional engineer or geologist.
(b) The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be
required for all disturbed areas within the proposed
development:
Pollutant Load Units
Required

Total suspended solids
(TSS)
Pounds 85%
Total phosphorous (TP) Pounds 85%

§ 144-16. Sensitive areas; stormwater hotspots.
(c) The performance criteria for water quality best management
practices shall be determined from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, most current
version.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within Butler County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one year, two-year, tenyear,
twenty-five-year, fifty-year, and one-hundred-year storms.
B. Lands contained within Butler County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) The post-development peak discharge rates shall be in accordance
with the approved release rate map for the following watersheds
(See Appendixes101 for the Release Rate Map):
(a) Connoquenessing Creek Watershed.
A. Sensitive areas and water-quality sensitive developments as defined
below which require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
(1) "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if developed, have
the potential to endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the
delineated one-year zone of contribution and direct upslope areas
tributary to the water supply wells. The Township may update the
sensitive area boundaries based on new research or studies as
required.
(2) "Stormwater hotspots" are defined as a land development project
that has a high potential to endanger local water quality, and could
potentially threaten groundwater reservoirs. The Township
Engineer will determine what constitutes these classifications on a
case-by-case basis. The PADEP wellhead protection contaminant
source list shall be used as a guide in these determinations.
Industrial manufacturing site and hazardous material storage
areas must provide NPDES SIC codes.
B. Performance standards.

§ 144-14 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-16
140:233
(1) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be
determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the
limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the sensitive
area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If the project
site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive
area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the limits of the
sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
plan to document the site's location relative to the sensitive area.
(2) Stormwater hotspots may be required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan and file notice of intent as
required under the provision of the EPA Industrial Stormwater
NPDES permit requirements.
(3) Stormwater hotspots must use an acceptable pre-treatment BMP
prior to volume control and/or rate control BMPs. Acceptable
pretreatment BMPs for these developments include those based on
filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes such as
coagulation.

Township for a consultation meeting on a concept plan for the postdevelopment
stormwater management system to be utilized in the
proposed project. This consultation meeting shall take place at the time
of the preliminary plan or other early step in the development process.
The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the post-development
stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project,
as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential
ideas for stormwater management designs before the formal site design
engineering is commenced.
E. All proposed regulated activities within a protected watershed shall
utilize, to the maximum extent possible, Low-Impact Development
Practices as contained in Appendix B.102

Design Criteria
§ 144-20. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
(3) Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation
area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding
tanks, infiltration systems, in line storage in storm sewers, and
grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and constructed
in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by
PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering
plans and performance capabilities and supporting site specific
soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to
verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources
may be accepted at the discretion of the Township Engineer. (A preapplication
meeting is suggested.)
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Township shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
§ 144-20 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-20
140:243
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with the Township, and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a Township or state roadway
without approval from the Township or PennDOT.
(2) The top, or toe, of any slope shall be located a minimum of 10 feet
from any property line.
(3) The minimum horizontal distance between any stormwater holding
facility shall be 25 feet. The lowest floor elevation of any structure
constructed immediately adjacent to a detention basin or other
stormwater facility shall be a minimum of two feet above the onehundred-
year water surface elevation.
(4) Stormwater management facility bottom (or surface of permanent
pool) elevations must be greater than adjacent floodplain
elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no floodplain is defined,
bottom elevations must be greater than existing ground elevations
50 feet from top of stream bank in the facility's vicinity.
(5) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-yearfloodplain
elevation must be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodway is not
designated, or no other evidence is provided.
(6) The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
§ 144-20 MIDDLESEX CODE § 144-20
140:244
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from underdrains need not
be accounted for in volume or rate control calculations.
(7) Whenever possible the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(8) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed 3:1, and may be
further reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.
(9) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed 3:1.
(10) Unless specifically designed as a volume control facility, all
stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of
2% extending radially out from the principal outlet structure.
Facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs may have a
bottom slope of zero.
(11) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities.
(12) Unless specifically designed as a volume control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours
from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests
performed at the facility locations and proposed basin bottom
depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-toempty
calculations if infiltration is a factor.
(13) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Discharges to drainage swales shall be dissipated, or piped, to an
acceptable point.
(14) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(a) Minimal maintenance, saturation tolerant vegetation must be
provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
(15) A safety fence may be required, at the discretion of the Township,
for any stormwater management facility. The fence shall be a
minimum of four feet high, and of a material acceptable to the
Township. A gate with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be
provided for maintenance access.
(16) Principal outlet structures: The primary outlet structure shall be
designed to pass all design storms (up to and including the onehundred-
year event) without discharging through the emergency
spillway. All principal outlet structures shall:

140:245
(a) Be constructed of reinforced concrete or an alternative
material approved by the Township Engineer. When approved
for use, all metal risers shall:
[1] Be suitably coated to prevent corrosion.
[2] Have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be sufficient weight to prevent
flotation of the riser.
[3] Provide a trash rack or similar appurtenance to prevent
debris from entering the riser.
[4] Provide an anti-vortex device, consisting of a thin vertical
plate normal to the basin berm.
(b) Provide trash racks to prevent clogging of primary outflow
structure stages for all orifices.
(c) Provide outlet aprons and shall extend to the toe of the basin
slope at a minimum.
(17) Emergency spillways. Any stormwater management facility
designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year post-development peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:
(a) The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one
foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
This is to be calculated when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure.
(b) Avoid locating on fill areas, whenever possible.
(c) The spillway shall be armored to prevent erosion during the
one-hundred-year post-development flow, with a blocked
primary outlet structure.
[1] Synthetic liners or riprap may be used, and calculations
sufficient to support proposed armor must be provided. An
earthen plug must be used to accurately control the
spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring material.
Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides of the
spillway, and continue at full width to a minimum of 10 feet
past the toe of slope.
(d) Township Engineer may require the use of additional
protection when slopes exceed 4:1 and spillway velocities
might exceed NRCS standards for the particular soils involved.
§ 144-20 MIDDLESEX CODE § 144-20
140:246
(e) Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows higher
than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year postdevelopment
inflow) without structural failure, or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
(18) Stormwater management basins: Design of stormwater
management facilities having three feet or more of water depth
(measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway) shall meet the following additional
requirements:
(a) The maximum water depth within any stormwater
management facility shall be no greater than eight feet when
functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(b) The top of embankment width shall be:
[1] For embankments up to four feet, width shall be at least six
feet;

feet.
(c) A ten-foot wide access to the basin bottom must be provided
with a maximum longitudinal slope of 10%.
(d) Berms shall be constructed using soils that conform to the
unified soil classification of CH, MH, CL or ML. Soils used shall
be tested to determine their density analysis per ASTM 698.
The embankments will be constructed in a maximum of six-inch
lifts. The lifts will each be compacted to a density at least 98%
of it's the maximum dry density. Each layer of compacted fill
shall be tested to determine its density per ASTM 2922 or
ASTM 3017. One test per 50 cubic yards of material placed (at
least one per layer) shall be performed by an independent
testing agency.
(e) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(f) Anti-seep collars, or a PADEP approved alternative, must be
provided on all outflow culverts in accordance with the
methodology contained in the latest edition of the PADEP E&S
Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15% must be used in
accordance with the requirements for permanent anti-seep
collars.
§ 144-20 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-20
140:247
(19) Construction of stormwater management facilities:
(a) Basins used for rate control only shall be installed prior to or
concurrent with any earthmoving or land disturbances which
they will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be noted
in the narrative and on the plan.
(b) Basins that include water quality or recharge components shall
have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(c) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times with copies being forwarded to
the Township Engineer upon request.
(d) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.
(20) Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
the Township for BMPs that retain or detain water, but are of a
much smaller scale than traditional stormwater management
facilities.
C. Stormwater-carrying facilities.

140:248
Publication 408, and as detailed in the PennDOT's Publication
72M, Standards for Roadway Construction (RC), or other detail
approved by the Township Engineer. All material and
construction details (inlets, manholes, pipe trenches, etc.),
must be shown on the SWM site plan, and a note added that
all construction must be in accordance with PennDOT's
Publication 408 and PennDOT's Publication 72M, latest

140:249
side of the low point at a distance not to exceed 100 feet, or at
an elevation not to exceed 0.2 feet above the low point.
(k) At all roadway low points, swales and easements shall be

§ 144-20 MIDDLESEX CODE § 144-20
140:250
§ 144-21. Calculation methodology.
(5) Swale conveyance facilities.
(a) Swales must be able to convey post-development runoff from a
10-year design storm with 6 inches of freeboard to top of the
swale.
(b) Swales shall have side slopes no steeper than 3:1.
(c) All swales shall be designed, labeled on the SWM site plan, and
details provided to adequately construct and maintain the
design dimension of the swales.
(d) Swales shall be designed for stability using velocity or shear
criteria. Velocity criteria may be used for channels with less
than ten-percent slope. Shear criteria may be used for all
swales. Documentation must be provided to support velocity
and/or shear limitations used in calculations.
(e) Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or shear
stresses shall be multiplied by the following factor for the
purpose of designing swale erosion protection:
[1] When swale bend is 30° to 60°: 1.75.
[2] When swale bend is 60° to 90°: 2.00.
[3] When swale bend is 90° or greater: 2.50.
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Other methods shall be selected by the design professional based on
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site and approved by the Township Engineer.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in
conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be
consistent with the following table:
§ 144-20 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-21
140:251
Return Interval
(year)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.02
2 2.41
10 3.38
25 4.00
50 4.50
100 5.03
D. Runoff volume.
(1) Rational method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates.
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more then one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's TR-55: limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS's TR-20, WinTR-20, WinTR-55, HEC-HMS: no
watershed size limitations.
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Township Engineer.
(b) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
§ 144-21 MIDDLESEX CODE § 144-21
140:252
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).103
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).104
Curve numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in
hydrologic models as they are a design tool with statistical
variability. For large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to
the nearest whole number.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20 percent of existing impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-year, two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year, fiftyyear,
and one-hundred-year hydrographs through the facility using
the storage indication method or Modified Puls Method. The design
storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method
that produces a full hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(3) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a Township road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of Concentration is to represent the average condition
that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Township
Engineer:
(a) Predevelopment: NRCS's Lag Equation:
103. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
104. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 144-21 SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING § 144-21
140:253
Time of concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) * 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = lag time (hours)
L = hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S
= [(1000/CN)  10]
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed
(b) Post-development; commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas (greater than 20% impervious area):
NRCS Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be
limited to 100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's Equation.
(c) Post-development; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NRCS Lag
Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The post-development Tc shall never be greater that the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
post-development watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc can not be assumed
for predevelopment.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
§ 144-21 MIDDLESEX CODE § 144-21
140:254
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the postdevelopment
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
J. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's Equation should not
be used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PennDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet control shall be checked at all
inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design
event is contained below the top of the grate for each inlet box.
K. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site

reasons, provided that such modification or waiver will not be contrary
to the public interest and that the purposes of the chapter are observed:

chapter is at variance with any other ordinance, rule or regulation or

imposing the higher standard shall govern.
C. Conflict with private provisions. Whenever the requirements of this
chapter are at a variance with the requirements of deed restrictions,
covenants or other private agreements, or with restrictive covenants
running with the land to which the Township is a party, the
requirements of this chapter shall remain unchanged and in full force
and effect.
D. Liability. The review and approval of a subdivision or land development
by the Township in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall

completion of improvements estimated as of 90 days following the
date scheduled for completion by the applicant or developer.
(2) Determination of amount. The amount of improvement security
required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of completion
of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or
developer and prepared by an engineer and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown.
(3) Resolution of disputes regarding amount. If the applicant or
developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate,
then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
engineer chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or
developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be
presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the
§ 150-12 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 150-12
147:305
event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant or
developer.
(4) Adjustment to amount. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the improvement security by comparing the actual cost
of the improvements which have been completed and the estimated
cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Township may require the applicant or
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the applicant or developer in accordance with this
subsection. If the party posting the improvement security requires
more than one year from the date of posting of the improvement
security to complete the required improvements, the amount of
improvement security may be increased by an additional 10% for
each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting of the improvement security or to an amount not exceeding
110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as
reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year
period by using the above procedure.
(5) Term. The term of the improvement security shall be for a period of
one year from the date that the improvement security is posted.
(6) Guarantees in phased development. In the case where development
is projected over a period of years, the Supervisors may authorize
submission of final plats by section or stages of development
subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in
future sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section of the development.
K. Notification of decision. The decision of the Supervisors shall be in
writing and shall be communicated to the applicant personally or
mailed to the applicant's last known address not later than 15 days
following the decision. If the decision is disapproval, the written
notification shall specify all defects in the final application and shall cite
with section numbers with provisions of this chapter or the section
numbers with provisions of any other applicable ordinances of the
Township that have not been satisfied.
L. Compliance with conditions of approval; municipal signatures. The
applicant shall comply with all conditions of approval, including
construction of required improvements or providing an improvement
security, before the proper Township officials execute the certifications
on the final plat. When the conditions of the final approval have been
met, the proper officers of the Township shall sign the final plat for
recording and shall affix the Township Seal.

constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good-faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
District Justice. Thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.

§ 155-14. Title; continuation of tax.
This article shall be known as the "Middlesex Township Earned Income Tax
Ordinance." The provisions hereof shall become effective on the first day of
July 2003 A.D. and the tax shall continue in force on a calendar-year or a
taxpayer fiscal-year basis, without annual reenactment, unless the rate of
the tax is subsequently changed. Changes in rate become effective on the
date specified in the amending ordinance.
§ 155-15. Statutory authority.
This article is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by the Act of
December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901, as amended.
§ 155-16. Definitions and interpretation.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

unincorporated group of two or more persons.

liable for failure to withhold earned income taxes or for the payment of

liable for failure to withhold earned income taxes, or to make reports of
wages, salaries, commissions or other compensation of his/its
employees, unless the official continuing register of all earned income

C. Bond.
(1) Each officer, before entering upon his official duties, shall give and
acknowledge a bond to the Township. If the Township shall, by
ordinance, designate any bond previously given by the officer as
adequate, such bond shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements
of this subsection. Each such bond shall be joint and several with
one or more corporate sureties which shall be surety companies
authorized to do business in this commonwealth and duly licensed
by the Insurance Commissioner of this commonwealth. Each bond

books, papers, documents, or other official things held in right of
his office.
(2) Each such bond shall be taken in the name of the Township, and

the use of such other person or persons for whom money shall be
collected or received, or as his or her interest shall otherwise
appear, in case of a breach of any of the conditions thereof by the
acts or neglect of the principal of the bond.
(3) The Township, or any person, may sue upon the said bond in its own
or his own name for its or his own use.
(4) Each such bond shall contain the name or names of the surety
company or companies bound thereon. The Township shall fix the
amount of the bond at an amount equal to the maximum amount of
taxes which may be in the possession of the officer at any given
time. The Township may at any time, upon cause shown and due
notice to the officer, and his surety or sureties, require or allow the
substitution or the addition of a surety company acceptable to the
Township for the purpose of making the bond sufficient in amount,
without releasing the surety or sureties first approved from any
accrued liability or previous action on such bond. The Township
shall designate the custodian of the bond required to be given by
the officer.
D. The officer charged with the administration and enforcement of the
provisions of this article is hereby empowered to prescribe, adopt,

§ 155-26 MIDDLESEX CODE § 155-27
155:370
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.

(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Township, in consultation with the Collector and DCED,
shall establish procedures and regulations for the processing of refund
claims for overpayment and/or for any tax paid by any person who is
eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with 53
Pa.C.S. §§ 8425 and 8426 and provisions of the General Municipal Law
relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Township or the Collector shall determine eligibility
for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll
period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
§ 155-27 MIDDLESEX CODE § 155-28
155:372
§ 155-29. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 155-30. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the
end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 155-31. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and
a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or plates of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 155-27B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

155:373
§ 155-32. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 155-33. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 155-34. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.

the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred, and which
regulations shall specifically provide for the processing of refund claims
for overpaid local services taxes in any calendar year consistent with 53
Pa.C.S. §§ 8425 and 8426. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
Collector shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas
of Butler County as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision

B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed. Nothing herein shall be
construed to repeal the imposition and collection of an occupation

services tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, for calendar years
2006 and 2007, as the same exist prior to this amendment.

155:380
§ 155-43. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth, or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax

tax.
§ 155-44. Excluded transactions.
of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer then the tax levied by the Township of Middlesex under the
authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
the Township of Middlesex, provided, however, that the Township of
Middlesex and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax
on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
A. The tax imposed by section shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation which reconveyance may include property line
adjustments provided said reconveyance is made within one year
from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which the Township of Middlesex is prohibited from
taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax
claim bureau sale.
§ 155-42 TAXATION § 155-44
155:381
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor
were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries that are entitled to receive the property
or proceeds from the sale of the property under the trust, whether
or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically named. A
trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by
reference to the heirs of the trust settlor as determined by the laws
of the intestate succession shall not disqualify a transfer from the
exclusion provided by this clause. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the recorder of deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of a
living trust from the settlor of the living trust. No such exemption
shall be granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a
copy of the living trust instrument.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
an ordinary trust to a specifically named beneficiary that is entitled
to receive the property under the recorded trust instrument or to a
contingent beneficiary where the transfer of the same property
would be exempt if the transfer was made by the grantor of the
property into the trust to that beneficiary. However, any transfer of
real estate from a living trust during the settlor's lifetime shall be
§ 155-44 MIDDLESEX CODE § 155-44
155:382
considered for the purposes of this article as if such transfer were
made directly from the settlor to the grantee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
a living trust after the death of the settlor of the trust or from a
trustee of a trust created pursuant to the will of a decedent to a
beneficiary to whom the property is devised or bequeathed.
(12) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from the trustee
of a living trust to the settlor of the living trust if such property was
originally conveyed to the trustee by the settlor.

successor trustee.
(14) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or agreement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(15) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
(16) A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.
(17) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt or the grantee or a

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
(a) The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
§ 155-44 TAXATION § 155-44

real estate transferred.
(19) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in

mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transfer or for
commercial purposes.
(21) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, [68A Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its
primary purpose preservation of land for historic, recreational,
scenic, agricultural or open space opportunities; or a transfer from
such a conservancy to the United States, the commonwealth or to
any of their instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions; or
any transfer from such a conservancy where the real estate is
encumbered by a perpetual agricultural conservation easement as
defined by the act of June 30, 1981 (P.L. 128, No. 43), known as the
"Agricultural Area Security Law," and such conservancy has owned
the real estate for at least two years immediately prior to the

interest in a real estate company, family farm corporation or family
farm partnership which owns real estate.
(25) A transaction wherein the tax due is $1 or less.
(26) Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.

and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Statement of
Value may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural
gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation
of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

§ 155-45. Documents relating to associations or corporations.

farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition
or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation
under this article.
C. A family farm partnership is an acquired company when, because of
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm

first moneys paid to him in connection therewith. If the proceeds of the sale
are insufficient to pay the entire tax herein imposed, the purchaser shall be

regarding the dedication of the required open space for public
use to the Township. If the Township accepts such a dedication,
the Township agrees to operate and maintain the dedicated
land and facilities for the originally intended use as common
open space.
(b) If the Board of Supervisors refuses acceptance of the required
open space for public use to the Township, the land and/or
facilities shall be conveyed to an organization established for
the ownership and maintenance of the common open space.
[1] The organization shall covenant to operate and maintain
the land and facilities as a common open space; such
organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of
the common open space, by sale or otherwise (except to an
organization conceived and established to own and
maintain the common open space), without first offering to
dedicate the same to the Township.
[2] Common open space shall be recorded with Butler County
independently from other portions of the planned
residential development.
(2) The Township shall not be obligated to accept the dedication of the
common open space or any portion thereof, where the Board of
Supervisors determines that such dedication is not in the interest
of the Township.

meet the following criteria:
§ 175-77. Findings of fact.
The decision granting or denying tentative approval shall be accompanied
by or include a detailed analysis containing findings of fact and relating to
the following criteria:
approval of the land development plan, with all attached conditions,
shall stand as granted.
A. The proposed land development plan shall preserve the objectives of
this ordinance and shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

departs from zoning requirements for similar development in other
districts and the Middlesex Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance160 otherwise applicable to the subject lot,
including, but not limited to, density, bulk and use, and the reasons why
such departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest.

160. Editor's Note: See Ch. 150, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 175-75 MIDDLESEX CODE § 175-77
168:496
§ 175-78. Timing.
If a proposed planned residential development is granted tentative
approval, with or without conditions, the Board of Supervisors shall set
forth in the decision the time within which an application for final approval
shall be filed. In the case of a land development plan that provides for
development over a period of years, the periods of time in which
applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be filed may also
be established in the official written communication. Only with the consent
of the applicant may the time between grant of tentative approval and
application for final approval be less than 90 consecutive calendar days,
and, in the case of development over a period of years, the time between
applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall not be less than
12 months.
§ 175-79. Certification of decision.
The decision shall be in writing, signed by the Chairman of the Board of
Supervisors, attested by the Township Manager, and filed in the office of the
Township Manager, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the applicant.
§ 175-80. Status of plan after tentative approval.
D. The physical design of the proposed planned residential development
and the aspects in which said design does or does not make adequate
provision for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular
traffic, and further amenities of light and air, recreation, and visual
enjoyment.
E. The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned
residential development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to
be established; and
F. The sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the
interest of the public and the residents of the planned residential
development and the integrity of the development plan.
A. Consent to revoke. Tentative approval of a land development plan shall
not qualify a plat of the planned residential development for recording,
authorize development, or authorize the issuance of any building
permits. A land development plan that has been given tentative
approval as submitted or with conditions accepted by the applicant
shall not be modified or revoked, by action of the Township pending an
application or applications for final approval. If the application for final
approval is filed within the periods of time specified in the decision
granting tentative approval, the Township shall act to modify or revoke
the tentative approval only for one or the other of the following reasons:
(1) Default or violation by the applicant of any of the conditions of
tentative approval.
§ 175-77 WATER § 175-80
168:497
§ 175-81. Application for planned residential development final
approval.
(2) Consent by the applicant to the modification or revocation.
B. Revocation of tentative approval. The tentative approval of the land
development plan may be revoked for either of the following reasons:
(1) The applicant notifies the Board of Supervisors in writing of the
intention to abandon the plans; or
(2) The applicant fails to file application for final approval within the
required time period. When tentative approval is revoked, all areas
included in the land development plan not granted final approval
shall be subject to all Township ordinances as though no
application had been filed.
C. Plan after tentative approval. A land development plan granted
tentative approval should be considered the overall plan of the
development. This plan may not be altered without the consent of the
applicant and the Board of Supervisors. The filing of an application for
final approval of the entire development or an approved phase shall be
consistent with the plan granted tentative approval.
D. Revisions. If there are any revisions to the plan affecting density/zoning
(i.e., units are added or deleted, affecting the overall amount of units
approved in the tentative approval), the approval must be amended.
The entire application submission must be revised and resubmitted to
the Township for an approval modification. At its request, additional
information may be required by the Township to determine the impact
of said revisions on the adjacent zoning districts, lots and/or applicable
infrastructure. A public hearing shall be required as part of a
resubmission.
A. Filing.
(1) Application for final approval shall be filed with the Township
Supervisors not later than 12 months following the grant of
tentative approval, unless otherwise specified by the Township
Supervisors. The application shall be submitted at least 21 days
prior to the regular meeting of the Planning Commission. The
application shall be comprised of one reproducible Mylar and eight
printed sets and one digital set in a form acceptable to the
Township of the land development plan, including the completion
bond and developer's agreement required by the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance161 for approval of a
final plat. The Planning Commission shall either accept the
application as complete and properly filed or return the application
to the applicant for resubmission if the application is incomplete
161. Editor's Note: See Ch. 150, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 175-80 MIDDLESEX CODE § 175-81
168:498
and improperly filed. If the application is returned as incomplete, a
written notice that cites the specific requirements of this ordinance
which have not been met shall be sent to the applicant.
(2) The date of the Planning Commission meeting at which the
application is accepted as complete and properly filed shall be the
official date of filing and shall represent the beginning of the fortyfive-
day period for review by the Planning Commission and action
by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Content of application for final approval. The application for final
approval shall include a land development plan, all required
supplementary data as specified herein, and a certificate of completion
of Improvements or a completion bond, as required by the Middlesex
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.162
(1) The land development plan shall include:
(a) All information as required for a final plat, as specified in the
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance;

common open spaces, common recreation facilities and other
improvements.
C. Final approval.
(1) If the application for final approval has been filed with all drawings,
specifications, other required documents in accordance with this
ordinance, and the official written communication of tentative
approval, the Planning Commission shall recommend approval of
said application to the Board of Supervisors. The Board of
162. Editor's Note: See Ch. 150, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 175-81 WATER § 175-81
168:499
Supervisors shall, within 45 days of the filing of the application
with the Planning Commission, grant such land development plan
final approval.
(2) Revisions. If there are any revisions to the plan not affecting the
overall density (i.e., units are moved, added, or deleted, but do not
change the total amount of units approved in the tentative
approval), the final approval must reflect these changes when
submitted to the Township. At its request, additional information
may be required by the Township to determine the impact of said
revisions on the adjacent zoning districts, lots and/or applicable
infrastructure. A public hearing shall be required as part of the
submission.
D. Denial of approval. If the land development plan as submitted contains
variations from the land development plan given tentative approval, the
Board of Supervisors may refuse to grant final approval. It shall,
however, within 45 days from the filing of the application for final
approval, advise the applicant of the refusal, setting forth in the notice
why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest. In the
event of such refusal, the applicant may take action as provided for in
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
E. Recording. A land development plan, or any part thereof, which has
been given final approval shall be certified by the Board of Supervisors
and recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds before any
development shall take place. Said plan shall be recorded within 90
days of the date final approval is granted by the Board of Supervisors or
final approval shall automatically be rescinded.
F. Judicial review. Any decision of the Board of Supervisors granting or
denying tentative or final approval of a proposed planned residential
development shall be subject to appeal by the same procedures and
with the same limitations as provided for zoning appeals by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.163
G. Failure to develop. In the event that a land development plan, or a
section thereof, is given final approval and thereafter the applicant
shall abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been finally
approved, or, in the event the applicant shall fail to commence and
carry out the planned residential development in accordance with the
time provisions of Section 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code after final approval has been granted, or, in the event
that the applicant shall substantially fail to develop in accordance with
the land development plan given final approval, no development or
further development shall take place on the lot included in the land
development plan until after the said lot is reclassified by enactment of
an amendment to the Township Zoning Ordinance in the manner
163. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 175-81 MIDDLESEX CODE § 175-81
168:500
§ 175-82. through § 175-91. (Reserved)
prescribed for such amendments in the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.
H. Enforcement remedies.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
the planned residential development provisions of this ordinance
shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not
more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney
fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment
shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date
of the determination of a violation by the District Justice. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice,
determining that there has been a violation, further determines
that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this ordinance to have believed that there was
no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have
been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the District Justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney
fees collected for the violation of this ordinance shall be paid over
to the Township. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may
grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine
pending a final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted
to grant to any person or entity other than the Township the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this Section.

request of the applicant received prior to its expiration. The
maximum extension permitted shall be one twelve-month
extension. The Supervisors may grant an extension for good cause
shown by the applicant and provided that the extension will not be
contrary to the purposes of this chapter or detrimental to the
surrounding neighborhood.
(8) Effect on prior approvals. Conditional use approval, granted prior
to the effective date of this subsection, shall expire automatically
without written notice to the developer if no application for

(a) The Supervisors shall consider whether proposed
modifications in any of the requirements of this chapter for
each zoning district contained in an application for
development for a conditional use will make for a more
efficient, attractive, and harmonious conditional use. If such
§ 175-92 WATER § 175-92
168:505
§ 175-93. Approval of uses by special exception; expiration.
modifications, in the judgment of the Supervisors, constitute
a more beneficial use of the site than provided for under the
requirements of the zoning district in which the site of the
conditional use is located, the Supervisors in their sole
discretion may grant the modifications for less strict
requirements; however, no modification shall be granted for
the following:
[1] Authorized uses shall be limited to those specified as
authorized uses or conditional uses in the zoning district in
which the site is located.
[2] No modification shall be granted for any construction,
development, use or activity within any floodway area.
[3] Under no circumstances shall a modification be granted to
the prohibitions of uses or activities in floodplain areas.
(b) Whenever a modification is granted to construct a structure
below the 100-year flood elevation, the Township shall notify
the developer in writing that:
[1] The granting of the modification will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance.
[2] Such modification increases the risk to life and property.
B. All provisions of Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance which
are not specifically modified by the Supervisors in approving a
conditional use shall apply to any conditional use involving subdivision
and land development.
C. Requests in writing. All requests for modifications or waivers shall be in
writing and shall accompany and be part of the application for
development. The requests shall state in full the grounds and facts of
hardship or evidence of equal or better result on which the request is
based, the provision or provisions of the chapter involved and the
minimum modification necessary.
D. Burden of proof. In any application for conditional use, the applicant
shall have the persuasion burden and presentation duty to show
compliance with this Code, and the applicant shall have the persuasion
burden to show the applicant's request is not detrimental to the health,
safety, and welfare.
A. Approval of uses by special exception. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
hear and decide requests for uses by special exception. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall not approve an application for a use by special

ARTICLE XV
Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 175-166. Applicability.
This article shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures, and lots as
defined by this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require any change
in the overall layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any
development, building, structure or part thereof for which official approval
and required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment thereto.
§ 175-167. Nonconforming uses.
These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any zoning
district which is a nonconforming use as defined by this chapter. Whenever
the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to transfer
an area from one zoning district to another of a different classification,
these regulations shall also apply to any uses which thereby become
nonconforming.
A. Continuation. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter, a lawful use of a lot or structure exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or
amended, such use may be sold or otherwise transferred to other
owners and may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful.
B. Enlargement or expansion.
(1) No nonconforming use of a lot or structure shall be enlarged or
increased or extended to occupy a greater area than was occupied
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
unless the Zoning Hearing Board, after public hearing, shall
authorize the enlargement or expansion as a use by special
exception in accordance with the following express standards and
criteria:
(a) There is evidence that the enlargement or expansion of the
nonconforming use is necessitated by the natural expansion
and growth of trade of the nonconforming use.
(b) Any such enlargement or expansion shall conform to the area,
height and yard requirements of the zoning district in which it
is located, unless a variance is granted.
(c) The enlargement or expansion is not proposed on property
which was not owned at the time the use became
nonconforming.
(2) No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
§ 175-166 WATER § 175-167
168:593
§ 175-168. Nonconforming structures.
These regulations shall apply to all nonconforming structures as defined by
this chapter in all zoning districts.
(3) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure which was designed for such use at the time the use
became nonconforming; however, a nonconforming use shall not be
extended to occupy any structure, except on a lot or portion of a lot
owned at the time the use became nonconforming.
C. Change of use. When a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming
use, the use thereafter shall not be changed to a nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use shall not be changed unless to a conforming use,
except when permitted as a use by special exception by the Zoning
Hearing Board in accordance with the following express standards and
criteria:
(1) The new use is equal to or better than the existing nonconforming
use. In making this determination, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider the other uses authorized in the most restrictive zoning
district in which the nonconforming use is listed as a permitted use,
conditional use or use by special exception to be equal uses and any
use authorized in any more restrictive zoning district in which the
nonconforming use is not listed as a permitted use, conditional use
or use by special exception to be better uses.
(2) The new use will more closely correspond to the uses permitted in
the district.
(3) The new use will be in keeping with the character of the
neighborhood in which it is located.
(4) Any change from one nonconforming use to another shall comply
with the parking requirements of Article XIII for the use and shall
be subject to the area, bulk and buffer yard regulations for such use
in the district where such use is authorized.
D. Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a structure and/or lot is
discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the structure
and/or lot shall not thereafter be used, except in conformance with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, except when
extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board.
E. Damage or destruction. In the event that damage or destruction of a
structure in which a nonconforming use is conducted involves 75% or
less of the gross floor area of the structure, repairs or reconstruction
may be undertaken, provided that such restoration is started within 12
months of the date of destruction. In the event that a structure in which
a nonconforming use is conducted is damaged or destroyed by fire or
other means to an extent of more than 75% of its gross floor area, the
structure shall be reconstructed only to house a conforming use.
§ 175-167 MIDDLESEX CODE § 175-168
168:594
§ 175-169. Nonconforming lots.
A. Structural alteration. No such structure may be enlarged or structurally
altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, except when the
Zoning Hearing Board, after public hearing, may determine undue
hardship and may authorize a reasonable modification of such
structure.
B. Damage or destruction. Any nonconforming structure which has been
partially or completely damaged or destroyed by fire or other means
may be rebuilt or repaired on its existing foundation even though such
foundation may violate the setback requirements for the zoning district
in which the structure is located, provided that the repair or
reconstruction and reoccupancy of the structure occurs within 18
months of the date that the original structure was damaged or
destroyed.
C. Moving. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the requirements of
the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Signs.
(1) Nonconforming signs may be repaired or reconstructed, provided
that no structural alterations are made which increase the gross
surface area of the sign; however, nonconforming signs which are
damaged or destroyed to an extent of more than 50% of their
replacement cost at the time of destruction shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.
(2) Nonconforming signs may not be enlarged, added to or replaced by
another nonconforming sign, use or structure, except that the
interchange of poster panels shall be permitted.
E. Repair or maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any
structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged
with protecting the safety of the public.
A. Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this chapter, and held
in separate ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots,
may be used for the erection of a structure conforming to the use
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, without a lot
area or lot width variance, even though its lot area and width are less
than the minimum required by this chapter; however, such lot must
comply with the front, rear and side yards, height and lot coverage
standards of the zoning district wherein it is located.
B. Where two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage
have less than the required lot area and lot width and are held by one
owner, the lots shall be consolidated in accordance with the
§ 175-168 WATER § 175-169
168:595
§ 175-170. Registration of nonconformity.
requirements of the Township's Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance172 for the purpose of complying with this chapter. No division
of any lot shall be made which does not comply with the requirements
of this chapter, unless a variance is granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board.
C. Where structures exist on adjacent nonconforming lots of record which
have front yards less than the minimum depth required, the minimum
front yard for an adjacent undeveloped nonconforming lot of record
shall be the average depth of the nonconforming front yards on the
immediately adjacent developed nonconforming lots on either side of
the undeveloped lot; provided, however, that in no instance shall the
front yard be less than 50 feet from the center line of any public street.
A. The owner of a nonconforming use shall make an application for
registration of the nonconforming use and upon presentation of
documentation acceptable to the Zoning Officer that the use was
lawfully in existence prior to the effective date of this chapter or any
amendment which created the nonconformity, the Zoning Officer shall
register the same on a map and by Butler County Deed and Assessment
Registry Tax Parcel Number as a legal nonconforming use.
B. In the course of administering this chapter and reviewing applications
for zoning certificates or variances, the Zoning Officer shall register all
nonconforming structures and nonconforming lots as they become
known through the application process.

168:597
§ 175-174. Jurisdiction of the board.
The Zoning Hearing Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
render final adjudication in the following matters:
B. Participation by alternate members. If, by reason of absence or
disqualification of a member, a quorum is not reached, the Chairman of

§ 175-176. Uses by special exception.
The Board shall have the power to hear and decide on applications for uses
by special exception subject to the application requirements of § 175-93 and
the express standards and criteria for the use set forth in Article XI. The
Board shall approve a use by special exception only if it meets all applicable
requirements of this chapter and the express standards and criteria set
forth in Article XI. In granting a use by special exception, the Board may
attach such reasonable safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this
involving subdivision and land development or planned residential
development.
A. The Board, upon appeal, shall have the power to authorize variances
from the requirements of this chapter, and to attach such conditions to
the variance as it deems necessary to assure compliance with the
purposes of this chapter. A variance may be granted if all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance necessary to afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and protect the public health, safety and
welfare.

§ 175-179. Mediation option.
I. Rehearing. If any application for a variance, use by special exception or
appeal from the Zoning Officer is denied, another identical application
shall not be filed within a period of one year from the date of denial,

change of circumstances which would warrant a hearing.
A. Where the Board fails to render a decision within the period required by
§ 175-177G or fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days of the
applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed
in writing or on the record to an extension of time.
B. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of
failure of the Board to meet or render a decision, the Board shall give
public notice of the decision within 10 days from the last day it could
have met to render a decision. If the Board shall fail to provide such
notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this section shall prejudice
the right of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to
the Court of Common Pleas.
A. Parties to proceedings authorized in this article may utilize mediation
as an aid in completing such proceedings. In proceedings before the
Zoning Hearing Board, in no case shall the Zoning Hearing Board
initiate mediation or participate as a mediating party. Mediation shall
supplement, not replace, those procedures in this article once they have
been formally initiated. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
expanding or limiting municipal police powers or as modifying any

the sound discretion of the court.

be taken to the Butler County Court of Common Pleas and shall be filed

the landowner and shall also consider:

supplies, schools and other public service facilities;

site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,

(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
D. Declaration of invalidity by the court. If the Township does not accept a
landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance with this
section and a court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the
court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire Ordinance, but only for those provisions which specifically relate
to the landowner's curative amendment and challenge.

Airport District Overlay
[Added 9-28-2011 by Ord. No. 122]
§ 175-231. Purpose. [Amended 3-20-2019 by Ord. No. 133]
The purpose of this article is to create an Airport District Overlay that
considers safety issues around the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport,
regulates and restricts the heights of constructed structures and objects
of natural growth, creates appropriate zones, establishing the boundaries
thereof and providing for changes in restrictions and boundaries of such
zones, creates the permitting process for use within said zones and provides
for enforcement, assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and
judicial review.
§ 175-232. Relation to other zone districts.
The Airport District Overlay shall not modify the boundaries of any
underlying zoning district. Where identified, the Airport District Overlay
shall impose certain requirements on land use and construction in addition
to those contained in the underlying zoning district.
§ 175-233. Definitions.
The following words and phrases when used in this article shall have the
meaning given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise.
AIRPORT ELEVATION  The highest point of an airport's usable landing
area measured in feet above sea level. The airport elevation for the
Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport is 1,248.[Amended 3-20-2019 by Ord.
No. 133]
AIRPORT HAZARD  Any structure or object, natural or man-made, or use
of land which obstructs the airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing,
or taking off at an airport or is otherwise hazardous as defined in 14 CFR
Part 77 and 74 Pa. C.S.A. § 5102.
AIRPORT HAZARD AREA  Any area of land or water upon which an airport
hazard might be established if not prevented as provided for in this article
and the Act 164 of 1984 (Pennsylvania laws relating to aviation).178
APPROACH SURFACE (ZONE)  An imaginary surface longitudinally
centered on the extended runway center line and extending outward and
upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is
applied to each of the runways based on the planned approach. The inner
edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface
and expands uniformly depending on the planned approach. The approach
surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,179 is derived from the approach surface.
178. Editor's Note: See 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq.
179. Editor's Note: Figure 1 is on file in the Township offices.

Transportation.
HEIGHT  For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set
forth in this article and shown on the Zoning Map,181 the datum shall be
mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
HORIZONTAL SURFACE (ZONE)  An imaginary plane 150 feet above
the established airport elevation that is constructed by swinging arcs of
various radii from the center of the end of the primary surface and then
connecting the adjacent arc by tangent lines. The radius of each arc is based
on the planned approach. The horizontal surface, as shown on Figure 1,182
is derived from the horizontal surface.
LARGER THAN UTILITY RUNWAY  A runway that is constructed for and
intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than 12,500
pounds maximum gross weight and jet-powered aircraft.
NONCONFORMING USE  Any preexisting structure, object of natural
growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this
article or an amendment thereto.
NONPRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY  A runway having an existing
instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only
horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a
straight-in nonprecision instrument approach procedure has been approved
or planned.
OBSTRUCTION  Any structure, growth, or other object, including a
mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth by this article.
PRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY  A runway having a existing
instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system
(ILS) or a precisions approach radar (PAR). It also means a runway for
which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an
approved airport layout plan or any other planning document.
PRIMARY SURFACE (ZONE)  An imaginary surface longitudinally
centered on the runway, extending 200 feet beyond the end of paved
runways or ending at each end of turf runways. The elevation of any point
on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on

the runway center line. The primary surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,183
is derived from the primary surface.
RUNWAY  A defined area of an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of
aircraft along its length.
STRUCTURE  An object, including a mobile object, constructed or
installed by man, including but without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes,
smokestacks, earth formation and overhead transmission lines.
TRANSITIONAL SURFACE (ZONE)  An imaginary surface that extends
outward and upward from the edge of the primary surface to the horizontal
surface at a slope of seven feet horizontally to one foot vertically (7:1).
The transitional surface zone, as shown on Figure 1,184 is derived from the
transitional surface.
TREE  Any object of natural growth.

AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of the proposal at least 30 days
prior to commencement thereof. The Department's BOA response must
be included with this permit application for it to be considered
complete. If the Department's BOA returns a determination of no
penetration of airspace, the permit it requests should be considered
in compliance with the intent of this Overlay Ordinance. If the
Department's BOA returns a determination of a penetration of airspace,
the permit shall be denied, and the project sponsor may seek a variance
from such regulation as outlined in § 175-236.
B. No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace
existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an
existing structure.
A. Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance
with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 77 Subpart B (FA Form 7460-1
as amended or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a
variance will depend on the determinations made by the FAA and the
Department's BOA as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of
air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable air space.
In particular, the request for a variance shall consider which of the
following categories the FAA has placed the proposed construction in:
(1) No objection: The subject construction is determined not to exceed
obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not required to
mitigate potential hazards. Under this determination, a variance
shall be granted.
(2) Conditional determination: The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this
determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon
implementation of mitigating measures as described in § 175-239,
Obstruction marking and lighting.
(3) Objectionable: The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied,
and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the
applicant.
B. Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that
a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the
public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this
article.

168:634
§ 175-237. Use restrictions. [Amended 3-20-2019 by Ord. No. 133]
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner
as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircrafts, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport, create bird stroke hazards or otherwise endanger
or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport.
§ 175-238. Preexisting nonconforming uses.
The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this
article, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use. No nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to
grow higher, so as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use,
once substantially abated (subject to the underlying ordinance) may only be
reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
§ 175-239. Obstruction marking and lighting.
Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this article
may be conditioned according to the process described in § 175-236 to
require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to
permit the Township, at its own expense, or require the person requesting
the permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such marking or
lighting as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air safety.
§ 175-240. Violations and penalties.
In the event the Township identifies any person, partnership or corporation
who or which has violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of
this article, the Township shall initiate enforcement proceedings against the
offending person, partnership or corporation as listed in § 175-184 of the
Township Code.
§ 175-241. Appeals.
Any person or Township official aggrieved or affected by any provision of
this chapter, or by any decision of the Zoning Officer, may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds
thereof in accordance with the provisions of § 175-174 of the Township
Code.

§ 175-250. Purpose.
The purposes of this district are to:
§ 175-251. Location.
The Route 228 Corridor Overlay applies to all properties within the corridor,
generally abutting the existing and/or proposed realigned Route 228 rightof-
way, as indicated on the revised Middlesex Township Official Zoning Map,
and the Route 228 Corridor Overlay District Sheet.187
§ 175-252. Applicability.
The requirements of the Route 228 Corridor Overlay District are
complementary and in addition to any other applicable requirements of the
existing base zoning districts and any other applicable zoning regulations.
Where there is a conflict between the Route 228 Corridor Overlay District
and any other applicable zoning requirement of the existing base zoning
districts, the Route 228 Corridor Overlay District shall supersede the
conflicting requirement to the extent of the conflicting requirement only,
except that the Route 228 Corridor Overlay District shall completely
preempt any base zoning district regulations with respect to billboards.
A. Allow for new commercial and office development while also
accommodating the preservation of farm land, open space, and rural
character;
B. Provide a gradation of land use intensity and density from the rural
nature of the Township to the more suburbanized Town Center zoning
area of the Township within the Route 228 Corridor;
C. Create a desirable "front door" gateway for the Township;
D. Accommodate land uses that primarily provide for services and
amenities utilized by the local community;
E. Introduce commercial and other uses into an area of the Township
where these uses were previously not permitted. The introduction of
these uses shall be sensitive to the existing land use context and
landscape. The uses and development of land along this corridor
overlay is intended to be of lesser density than that permitted in the
existing C-2 Highway Commercial or C-3 Regional Commerce Zoning
Districts.

grantee shall, at a minimum, at all times, fully comply with technical
standards which have been or which hereafter may be adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), including (without
limitations), if applicable, requirements relating to channel capacity,
bandwidth and periodic testing. Further, should any federal, state or
local governmental unit with jurisdiction establish technical standards
that exceed those of the FCC, the grantee will comply therewith when
and to the extent required by such governmental unit, unless to require
the grantee to do so would be held invalid by the FCC or a court of
administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction. The technical quality
of the service provided by the grantee shall be sufficient to provide
subscribers with uniform quality television reception. The grantee shall
maintain the system in good repair and working order at all times.
A. Installation charges, monthly service rates and any other residential
rates charged by the grantee related to the basic service tier, as defined

§ A177-35. Discrimination practices prohibited.
The grantee shall not, as to rates, charges, service, service facilities, rules,
regulations, or, in any other respect, make or grant unlawful undue
preference or advantage to any person, nor subject any person to any
unlawful prejudice or disadvantage, provided that nothing in this franchise
shall be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of
charges and classified rate schedules to which any customer coming within
such classification would be entitled. Connection and/or service charges
may be waived or modified during promotional campaigns of the grantee.
The Township acknowledges that the offering of different programming
and service rates by the grantee in portions of the Township also served
by another multi-channel video distributor shall not constitute an act of
discrimination prohibited by this section.
§ A177-36. Insurance.

1992 and 1996 and applicable FCC rules and regulations. Commercial
installation charges and monthly service rates are negotiable and not
covered by federal regulations.
B. The grantee shall offer the services of the system within the Township
on terms and conditions which are uniform and nondiscriminatory to
the fullest extent practicable. The provisions of this Section will not
apply in any area of the Township in which another multi-channel video
distributor provides cable, internet or telecommunication services,
whereby the parties agree such action constitutes effective
competition.
C. The rates and charges for all services of the system (specifically
including but not limited to basic subscriber service, any additional
service provided pursuant to this section, or any connection,
maintenance or similar service) and equipment shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time, at the sole discretion of the grantee.
A. The grantee shall maintain insurance throughout the term of this
agreement with the Township as an additional insured, with an
insurance company which is authorized to conduct business in
Pennsylvania and which has an A.M. best rating (or equivalent) no less
than "A", indemnifying the Township from and against any and all
claims for injury or damage to persons or property, both real and
personal, caused by the construction, installation, reconstruction,
operation, maintenance or removal of the cable system by the grantee
or any of its contractors, subcontractors, agents or employees in the
following amounts:
(1) The amount of such insurance against liability for damage to
property shall be no less than $1,000,000 as to any one occurrence.

§ A177-37. Effective date and term of franchise.
The right and privilege herein granted shall take effect and be in force
from and after the effective date and shall continue in force and effect for
a period of 10 years from the effective date of this agreement. Upon the
expiration of said period and provided that the grantee has complied with
the terms and conditions hereof, the grant and provisions hereof shall be
renewed under the provisions of the Cable Communications Act of 1984,
Section 626. In the event the term expires without a renewed agreement,
the parties agree hereto that the grantee shall be permitted to continue
to operate the cable system and collect the franchise fees until a formal
agreement is reached.
§ A177-38. Federal regulation.
In the event and to the extent that the terms and provisions hereof shall
be superseded and preempted by or become inconsistent with state law or
federal law (including rules and regulations promulgated by the FCC), then
and in each such event, it shall be the right of the grantee to take such
action within 60 days after such event as shall be reasonably necessary
and may be reasonably requested to so amend or modify in writing this
agreement and to preserve the written contract for rights and benefits of
the grantee and fulfill the intent and purposes of this agreement.
§ A177-39. Severability.
Subject to the provisions of this section hereof, if any section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this agreement is for any reason
held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative tribunal of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions hereof.
(2) The amount of such insurance against liability for injury or death to
any person shall be no less than $1,000,000.
(3) The amount of such insurance for excess liability shall be
$5,000,000 in umbrella form.
(4) The amount of such insurance against all claims arising out of the
operation of motor vehicles and general tort or contract liability
shall be $1,000,000.
(5) The grantee shall maintain workers' compensation insurance on all
employees engaged in its installation or service of its equipment.
B. All insurance coverage shall be maintained throughout the period of
this agreement. All expenses incurred for said insurance shall be at the
sole expense of the grantee.

§ A177-40. Interpretation.
Notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, the
Township agrees that in the event of any ambiguity with respect to the
terms and conditions of this franchise, or dispute as to meaning, the
Township shall, in conjunction with the grantee, make a good faith effort to
establish the meaning of such terms and conditions in a manner consistent
with the parties' original intent of the language.
§ A177-41. Conflict of interest.
The grantee shall not engage in the business of selling, leasing or repairing
television or radio receivers in connection with the operation of its cable
system; nor shall the grantee and its employees require or attempt to direct
its customers to deal with any particular firm or person engaged in such
business.
§ A177-42. Defaults; arbitration.
A. In the event that the Township determines that grantee is in violation of
the terms and conditions of this agreement, the Township shall provide
the grantee with written notice, which describes the violation for which
such notice is being issued, of such determination. The grantee shall
have 60 days from the date of the Township's written notice to either
cure the violation or, for violations which cannot reasonably be cured
within such sixty-day period, demonstrate to the Township that the
grantee is using its reasonable best efforts to cure such violation. If the
Township provides the grantee with written notice under this section
and the grantee fails to either cure or demonstrate that it is using its
reasonable best efforts, the Township shall have the right to invoke the
arbitration procedure set forth in this section hereof.
B. In the event of any dispute arising under this agreement, as the same
may be amended or supplemented, such dispute shall be submitted to
arbitration upon request of any one or more of the disputants, who shall
notify each of the other disputants in writing of such request. Each of
the disputants shall confer with the other disputants for the purpose of
selecting by unanimous agreement an independent arbitrator. Failing
such agreement within 30 days of the earliest such notice, upon request
of any one or more of the disputants, such selection shall be made
through the services and facilities of the regional office of the American
Arbitration Association located, geographically, nearest to the cable
system and in accordance with the rules thereof. The decision and
award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the disputants.
The costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the fees of the
arbitrator, shall be borne by the non-prevailing party in such
arbitration.

§ A177-43. Grantee's inability to perform.
In the event the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions,
obligations or requirements of this agreement is prevented or impaired due
to any cause beyond its control or not foreseeable, such inability to perform
shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof, provided the grantee has notified the Township
in writing within 30 days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event.
This section shall not be construed to relieve the grantee of the obligation
for adjustments contained in § A177-38. Such causes beyond the grantee's
control or not foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, acts
of God, civil emergencies and possible labor unrest or strikes including by
telephone or power company owners of said poles.
§ A177-44. Binding effect.
This agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Township and the
grantee, and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that without the written consent of the Township, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the grantee shall not assign the right,
license or privilege herein granted to any person, firm or corporation other
than a person, firm or corporation affiliated with it. Township consent shall
not be required for the collateral assignment of a grant of security interest
in this agreement for purposes of securing indebtedness. The terms and
provisions of this agreement may not be amended or modified, by ordinance
or otherwise, except as agreed upon in writing by both parties hereto.
§ A177-45. Community service.
The grantee will, at no charge to the Township, provide basic cable service
to the Township buildings, public school buildings, public library, police
stations and fire stations located in the Township and which are also located

which the grantee shall provide basic cable service under this section are
identified in Exhibit A attached hereto and made part hereof.191
