Preface
The Lakeland Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Lakeland, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin
of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the
section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation
indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
iii
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of Sandy Selvage, the MTAS Sr. Word Processing
Specialist who did all the typing on this project, and Tracy G. Gardner,
Administrative Services Assistant, is gratefully acknowledged.

governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics. (as added
by Ord. #06-96, Oct. 2006)

and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed official
or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (as added by Ord. #06-96, Oct. 2006)

health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions

restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor
effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
(2) Findings and rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse
secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the board, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing
constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4,

1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-

1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York,
New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's
Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6,
1989, State of Minnesota), the board finds:
9-10
(a) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial
uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects
including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution,
potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit
drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding
properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(b) Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from
sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon
such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented
businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses
and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented
businesses in one area.
(c) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes
a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in
preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in
preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this
ordinance, exists independent of any comparative analysis between
sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the
city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to
preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually
oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the
cases and documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. (as added by
Ord. #06-85, Feb. 2006)

than or equal to the combined height of the walls. (as added by
Ord. #08-121, July 2008)
12-106. Variances. Where there are unique constraints that would
prohibit full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and would deny the
property owner of use of their property that would be permitted to other
properties, a variance may be considered. (as added by Ord. #08-121, July 2008)

is the minimum relief necessary, considering the amount of the fee and/or the
property classification.
(7) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship compared to other similarly assessed
property; and

result in conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(8) Written notice. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall
be given written notice by the board of appeals.

(2) Designation of public officer or department. The city manager shall
designate an appropriate department or person to enforce the provisions of this
section.

person designated to enforce the provisions of this section to serve notice upon
the owner of record in violation of subsection (1) above. The notice shall be given
by United States mail, addressed to the last known address of the owner of

last known address exists for the owner of record, the municipality may publish
the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the
property sits for no less than two (2) consecutive issues or personally deliver the
notice to the owner of record. For purposes of this section, such publication shall
constitute receipt of notice effective on the date of the second publication of the

delivery. The notice shall state that the owner of the property is entitled to a
hearing. The notice shall be written in plain language and shall also include, but
not be limited to, the following elements:
(a) A brief statement of this section, which shall contain the
consequences of failing to remedy the noted condition;
(b) The person, office, address and telephone number of the

appropriate department or person may immediately cause the condition to be
remedied or removed at a cost in conformity with reasonable standards and the
cost thereof assessed against the owner of the property. The municipality may
collect the costs assessed against the owner through an action for debt filed in
any court of competent jurisdiction. The municipality may bring one (1) action
for debt against more than one (1) or all of the owners of properties against
13-4
whom such costs have been assessed, and the fact that multiple owners have
been joined in one (1) action shall not be considered by the court as a misjoinder
of parties. Upon the filing of the notice with the office of the register of deeds of
the county in which the property lies, the costs shall be a lien on the property
in favor of the municipality, second only to liens of the state, county and
municipality for taxes, any lien of the municipality for special assessments, and
any valid lien, right or interest in such property duly recorded or duly perfected
by filing, prior to the filing of such notice. These costs shall be collected by the
municipal tax collector or county trustee at the same time and in the same
manner as property taxes are collected. If the owner fails to pay the costs, they
may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as delinquent
property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalty and
interest as delinquent property taxes.
(5) Clean-up of owner-occupied property. (a) When the owner of an
owner-occupied residential property fails or refuses to remedy the
condition within ten (10) days after receiving the notice, the appropriate
department or person may inunediately cause the condition to be
remedied or removed at a cost in accordance with reasonable standards
in the community, with these costs to be assessed against the owner of
the property. Subsection (4) shall apply to the collection of costs against
the owner of an owner-occupied residential property, except that the
municipality shall wait until cumulative charges for remediation equal
or exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) before filing the notice with the
register of deeds and the charges becoming a lien on the property. After
this threshold has been met and the lien attaches, charges for costs for
which the lien attached are collectible as provided in subsection (4) for
these charges.
(b) If the person who is the owner of record is a carrier engaged
in the transportation of property or is a utility transmitting
communications, electricity, gas, liquids, steam, sewerage or other
materials, the ten (10) day period specified in subsection (4) shall be
twenty (20) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.
(6) Appeal/hearing. The municipal governing body or the appropriate
department, or both, may make any rules and regulations necessary for the
administration and enforcement of this section. The municipality shall provide
for a hearing upon request of the person aggrieved by the determination made
pursuant to subsection (b). A request for a hearing shall be made within ten (10)
days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to subsection (3). Failure
to make the request within this time shall without exception constitute a waiver
of the right to a hearing. Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the board
of commissioners under this section may seek judicial review of the order or act.
The time period established in subsection (5) shall be stayed during the
pendency of a hearing.

remedy or remove any condition described in this section, any property owner
who violates this section may be cited and subject to a civil penalty of fifty
dollars ($50.00) plus court costs for each separate violation of this section. Each
day the violation continues shall be considered a separate violation. (as added

(iv) If the responsible party fails to remove a hazardous
tree within the time specified in the written notice from the city,
such failure shall constitute a violation of this division and shall be
punishable in accordance with State Law and the provisions of this
ordinance.
(v) If the responsible party fails to remove a hazardous
tree within the time specified in the written notice from the city,
and if the city determines that the hazardous tree constitutes an
imminent threat to the property of others or to the general public
or could result in damage to overhead lines or obstruction of
streets, the city shall have the right to enter upon the property and
remove the tree, and all costs incurred by the city in such regard
shall be due and payable from the responsible party to the city
upon demand, and, if not paid, the city shall have the right to file

provisions of Section 13-421.1 of this chapter.
(c) Authorization for public tree removal. It shall be unlawful
for any person, organization, firm, or corporation to remove or cause the
removal of any public tree, as defined in this ordinance, without first
obtaining a tree removal permit from the Arborist. The applicant for said
tree removal must apply in writing to the City stating reasons for the tree
removal. Upon receipt of the application, the Arborist shall review the
application and evaluate the tree in question. If the tree in question is a
non-specimen tree, or is determined by the Arborist to be a hazard to
public safety, the Arborist may make a decision regarding its removal.
Such decision will be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
application. If the tree in question is a specimen tree, the Arborist shall
forward the removal request to the Lakeland Tree Board along with a
recommendation. The Tree Board decision shall be final.
(d) Removal of stumps. All stumps of removed public trees shall
be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump
shall not project of the surface of the ground. Stump removal shall be
performed by the responsible party in a timely manner after tree
removal.

area, may be removed, or caused to be removed, by the City of Lakeland
Natural Resources Department or Parks and Recreation Department.
The Arborist shall make a recommendation regarding the removal of such
trees to the appropriate authority.
(7) Qualifications of Contract Tree Companies. All tree care workers
and companies hired by the City or by outside parties that perform work on
public trees shall provide the City with proof of at least one ISA Certified
Arborist on staff or consulting with the company or individual.
(8) Trees of Historic or Special Significance. A tree of significant age,
size or history can constitute a unique asset to the community. The Board of
Commissioners, upon the recommendation of the Tree Board, can designate a
unique specimen as a Lakeland heritage tree. A public tree so designated will
be given special protection and maintenance, and special recognition as the
situation warrants.
(9) Official City Tree. It is hereby decreed that the Quercus alba (white
oak) shall be the official city tree. This selection is made because of its history,
superior form and shape, its value to wildlife, and its strength of structure and
life span in our geographic area. While it is not recommended that this species
be selected over other species in planting on public or private property, it is
recommended that the tree be recognized as a symbol of the community. (as

taken by filing with the Board of Appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the
grounds thereof. The Arborist shall transmit to the Board all papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed was taken. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, giving public notice thereof, as

(2) Variance from Tree Ordinance. To hear and decide applications for
variance from the terms of this Ordinance, but only where by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of specific piece of property which
at the time of adoption of this Ordinance was a lot of record; or where, by reason
of exceptional topographic conditions, physiographic conditions, soil physiology,
or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or conditions of a piece of
property the strict application of the provisions of the Ordinance would result
in exceptional difficulties or the exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner
of such property, provided that such relief may be granted without the
substantial detriment to the public and without substantially impairing the
intent and purpose of this Ordinance. Financial disadvantage to the property
owner is no proof of hardship within the purpose of this ordinance and as
further explained below. The Board shall not grant a variance unless it makes
findings based upon evidence presented to it as follows:
(a) Physical or topographical conditions. The particular physical
surroundings, shape, or topographic conditions of the specific property
involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict application of this
Ordinance were carried out.
(b) Relationship to other properties within the district. The
conditions upon which the petition for variance is based would not be
applicable, generally, to other property within the same district.
(c) Permitted activity. The variance will not authorize activities
in a zoning district other than those permitted by this Ordinance.
(d) Financial implications. The variance is not based solely on
financial returns.
(e) Self-created hardship. The alleged difficulty or hardship has
not been created by any person having an interest in the property after
the effective date of this Ordinance.
(f) Special privilege. Granting the variance will not confer on
this applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to
other lands, structures, or building in the same district.
(g) Minimum variance required. The variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building,
or structure.
(h) Effect on public welfare. Granting the variance will not be
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the area in which property is located.
(i) Effect on adjacent properties. The variance will not impair
an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially
increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire,
endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property
values within the area.
13-38
(j) Physiological conditions. The physical geology of or soil
conditions on the site are such that the site has historically not sustained
nor is capable of sustaining tree cover.
(k) Prohibited uses. Under no circumstances shall the Board of
Appeals grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms
of this Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the terms of this Ordinance in said district.
(3) Conditions and Restrictions by the Board of Appeals. The Board of
Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefited by a variance as may be necessary to reduce or minimize the injurious
effect of such variation upon surrounding property and better carry out the
general intent of this Ordinance. (as added by Ord. #____, Feb. 2001, and

shall state that the responsible party is entitled to a hearing and shall contain,
at a minimum, the following information:
(a) A brief statement that the responsible party is in violation
of the Lakeland Municipal Code, which has been enacted under the
authority of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 6-19-101, and that the violation

against the property to secure the cost of mitigation of the violation;
(b) A cost estimate for remedying the noted condition, which
shall be in conformity with the standards of cost in the City; and

condition within the time frame specified by the notice, the City shall cause the
condition to be remedied at a cost in conformity with reasonable standards and
the cost thereof shall be assessed against the owner of the property and/or
prosecution in a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon filing of the notice with

14-401. Purposes, applicability and effect. (1) Purposes. The
purposes of these regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a
means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the pleasing look
of the city, which attracts to the city major events of regional interest; to
preserve Lakeland as a community that is attractive to business; to improve
pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs
on nearby public and private property; and to implement relevant provisions of
the comprehensive plan, as updated from time to time.
In that context, the city continuously invests in parks, landscaping, quality
public facilities and other features and amenities that enhance the
attractiveness of the community; a major purpose of this chapter is to ensure
that signs in the community are compatible with the high quality image that the
city seeks and in which the city continuously invests.
(2) Applicability. A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted,
created or maintained in the city in conformance with the standards,
procedures, exemptions and other requirements of this chapter. Signs exempt
from regulations under § 14-403 of this chapter, shall not otherwise be subject
to this chapter.
(3) Effect. The effect of this chapter, as more specifically set forth
herein, is:
(a) To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of
signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs
in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this
chapter;
14-6
(b) To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive and
incidental to the principal use of the respective property on which they
are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter, but
without requirement for permits;
(c) To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(d) To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this chapter;
and
(e) To provide for the enforcement of provisions of this chapter.
(4) Transitional provisions. (a) All holders of permits for signs issued
legally prior to month, date, year may erect the signs which are the
subject of such permits within the times allowed by such permits, and
such signs shall then be treated as though they had been erected prior to
month, date, year. However, such permits may not be extended or
amended unless the sign that is the subject of such permit will conform
to all of the requirements of this chapter.
(b) All violations of the sign regulations repealed by the
adoption of this chapter shall remain violations of the ordinances of the
city and all penalties and enforcement remedies set forth hereunder shall
be available to the city as though the violation were a violation of this
chapter. However, if the effect of this chapter is to make a sign that was
formerly nonconforming become conforming, then enforcement action
shall cease except to the extent of collecting penalties (other than removal
of the sign) for violations that occurred prior to month, date, year. (1989

forth there. Principles for computing sign area and sign height are given in the
next section. All words and phrases shall be given their common, ordinary
meanings, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. Section headings or
captions are for reference purposes only and shall not be used in the
14-16
interpretation of this chapter. Illustrations included in the code shall be used
in interpreting the relevant provisions, but where the text conflicts with an
illustration the text shall control.
(3) Computations. (a) Area computation of individual signs: The area
of a sign comprised of individual letters or elements attached to a
building wall is determined by calculating the area of the smallest
geometric figure (e.g. square, rectangle, circle, polygon, etc.) that can be
drawn around the letters and/or elements.
Signs consisting of individual letters and/or elements will be
measured as one (1) sign when the distance between the letters and/or
elements is less than the largest dimension of the largest sign letter.
Figure 1: Area Computation of Sign of
Individual Signs
(b) Area computation of multi-faced signs: Where the sign faces
of a double-faced sign are parallel, only one (1) display face shall be
measured in computing sign area. If the two (2) faces of a double-faced
sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the
larger face. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multi-faced sign
shall be added together to compute the area of the sign. Sign area of
multi-faced signs is calculated based on the principle that all sign
elements that can be seen at one (1) time or from one (1) vantage point
should be considered in measuring that side of the sign.
Figure 2: Area Computation of Multi-Faced Signs
14-17
(c) Sign height computation: The height of a sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the
top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive
of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of
locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade is below grade at
street level, sign heights shall be computed on the assumption that the
elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public or private street.
Figure 3: Sign Height Computation
(d) Building frontage: Building frontage shall mean the
horizontal length of a building on the side with its principal entrance. If
that side is a straight wall, then the building frontage shall be the length
of the wall. If the side is not a straight wall, the building frontage shall
be the horizontal distance from the corner at one (1) end of the side of the
building with the principal entrance to the other corner on the same side
of the building; where that side of the building is concave, then the
measurement shall be made in a straight line from corner to project in
front of the front corners, then the measurement shall be made as the
shortest distance between two (2) lines projected from the two (2) front
corners of the building, with such lines parallel to each other and as close
as practicable to perpendicular to the front of the building.

variance to the number of colors, use of logos and trademarks, location,
orientation, illumination, and other related design elements for permitted signs
as specifically provided for in various sections of this chapter and pursuant to
procedures set forth in city code, where all the following conditions exist:
(a) Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the
sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape or topography, which are
not applicable generally to other lands or structures in the area.
(b) The applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly
enjoyed by others similarly situated.

to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others
similar situated.
(f) Granting of the variance would not violate more than one (1)
standard of this chapter.

that interferes with road or highway visibility or obstruct or otherwise
interfere with the safe and orderly movement of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic.
(2) Variance allowed. A request for variance from the sign ordinance
shall be submitted to the design review commission through the City of

enumerated in § 14-410(1) of this chapter. No variance shall be granted to the
height or setback requirement in excess of ten percent (10%) of the prescribed
standards in this article. The design review commission may allow variances
to dimensional requirements for wall sign area (not the method of computation)
that permit an increase above the maximum sign area provided there is suitable
wall surface and building massing upon which to place a larger wall sign. (1989
Code, § 4-210, as amended by Ord. #192, Dec. 1996, replaced by Ord. #03-41,

chapter and still exhort the business of the occupant. In the event that the code
enforcement official determines that a sign is deficient as above recited, he shall
cause to be delivered a formal written notice to the owner and/or occupant
directing the correction of the deficiency within ten (10) days. Upon failure to
properly correct the deficiency of said notice within the time allotted, the sign
shall be rendered an illegal sign subject to the enforcement provisions as
hereinbefore provided.
(2) Annual inspection required. (a) The City of Lakeland shall inspect

official to the owner or occupant of property upon which an illegal sign, an
unsafe sign, unsafe sign structure or unsafe appurtenance thereto, is located,

or in the alternative, with the leave of the city manager, the code enforcement
official or his designee may remove same or provide for its immediate removal,

14-412. Nonconforming signs. It is the policy of the City of Lakeland
to encourage that all signs within the city be brought into compliance with the
terms and requirements of this chapter.
(1) Nonconforming signs adversely affect public health, safety and
welfare. The city finds that non-conforming signs may adversely affect the
public health, safety and welfare. Such signs adversely affect the aesthetic
characteristics of the city and may adversely affect public safety due to visual
impact of said signs on motorists and the structural characteristics of said signs.
Accordingly, the following registration requirements are found to be necessary
in order to minimize these possible adverse effects through annual inspections
and maintenance and allow the city to remain cognizant of the locations and
maintenance of said signs.
(2) Inspection of nonconforming signs. The city may inspect existing
signs in the city from time to time to determine if such signs conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
(3) Discontinuance of nonconforming signs. Any nonconforming sign,
which is not used or leased for a continuous period of ninety (90) days, shall not
be reused for sign purposes unless and until it fully conforms to the terms and
requirements of this chapter.
(4) Removal of non-conforming signs. All non-conforming signs
provided the non-conformity has been documented as hereinbefore provided
shall be removed within the earliest applicable time period or occurrence as
specified below:
(a) Change in use. When the use of a property changes
(including but not limited to the redevelopment of the site or a change in
use, the signs on that property must be brought into compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
(b) Abandonment. Any sign related to a use or business that
ceases to exist or operate for a continuous period of ninety (90) days shall
be considered nonconforming and shall not be reused for sign purposes
unless and until it is in full conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
subject to issuance of a new sign permit.
(c) Alterations to nonconforming signs. No alterations to a
nonconforming sign or sign structure shall be permitted except minor
repairs and maintenance. Any structural or other substantial
maintenance or improvement to a nonconforming sign (except painting
or refinishing the surface of the existing sign face or sign structure so as
to maintain proper appearance) shall be deemed an abandonment of the
nonconforming status, shall render any prior permit void, and shall result
in the reclassification of such sign as an illegal sign.
(5) Alteration, expansion, moving. No nonconforming sign shall be
changed or altered in any manner which would increase the degree of its
nonconformity, be expanded, altered to prolong its useful life, or removed in
whole or part to any other location where it would be nonconforming.
14-49
(6) Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming sign
is damaged or destroyed by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the fair market value of such sign immediately prior to such damage or
destruction, such sign shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter, conform
to this chapter.
(7) Maintenance and repair of nonconforming signs. No structural
repairs, change in shape, size or design, shall be permitted except to make a
nonconforming sign comply with all requirements of this chapter.
(8) Other sign permits on premises. (a) For single occupant properties,

14-901. Intent. The intent of this chapter is to foster aesthetically
pleasing developments which will protect and preserve the appearance,
character, health, safety and welfare of the community. Specifically, these
regulations are intended to increase the compatibility of adjacent uses requiring
a buffer or screen between uses, to minimize the harmful impact of noise, dust,
debris, motor vehicle headlight glare, or other artificial light intrusions, and
other objectionable activities or impacts conducted or created by an adjoining or
nearby land use. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and replaced by
Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-902. Applicability. (1) All new development, excluding agricultural
use and the individual development of single-family or two-family detached
dwelling units, shall comply with the landscape and screening requirements. All
development located within office, commercial and industrial zoning
classifications as well as non-residential uses in residential districts shall be
subject to the landscape and screening requirements.
14-90
(2) Any parking lot constructed as a result of the expansion of an
existing development shall comply with the landscape and screening
requirements.
(3) Expansion of all existing development which, after the passage of
the ordinance comprising this chapter, exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the
existing gross square footage or any change in use which results in the property
becoming a higher impact use as indicated by an increase in average daily trip
generation (ADTs) per day, shall comply with the following:
(a) The site shall be modified to provide at least fifty percent
(50%) of the amount of landscaping which would be required for a
comparable new development; provided, however, that in the case of an
existing site that already has landscaping in excess of the fifty percent
(50%) required for a new development no additional landscaping may be
required by the design review commission. If it is not feasible to meet the
quantity or placement requirements, the required landscaping may be
modified with the approval of the design review commission including the
introduction of larger plant specimens as a means of compensating for the
lack of required landscaping.
(b) Any change in use which results in a higher impact shall
require buffers and screening measures as set forth in the landscape and
screening requirements. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and
replaced by Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-903. General design parameters. (1) The following general design
parameters shall be considered in designing landscaping areas:
(a) Landscape design and species shall be used to create visual
continuity throughout the development. Landscape coordination shall
occur among all phases of the development.
(b) Landscape areas should be combined to form large clusters
at highly visible locations such as landscape courts, plazas or common
areas.
(c) Landscape design should create variety, interest and view
corridors for visibility.
(d) A variety of different species (including both deciduous and
evergreen species) shall be incorporated into the site design to provide
visual interest, as well as disease and pest resistance. A minimum of
twenty percent (20%) of the plantings shall be evergreen/coniferous
species.
(e) Required landscape plantings shall be coordinated with the
location of utilities, driveways, and traffic clearance zones. Landscape
plantings shall be located an adequate distance away from utility lines
and easements to avoid damage when such lines are repaired or replaced.
(2) All landscape areas shall be irrigated. (as added by Ord. #04-68,
Sept. 2004 and replaced by Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-91
14-904. Tree preservation and protection requirements. (1) Tree
preservation. Site plans and plats shall be designed to preserve existing trees
and vegetation to the greatest extent possible and shall seek to incorporate
existing stands of trees as well as individual trees. Sensitivity to the site
grading, storm drainage, building location, public/private utility layouts and
easements, and parking lot configurations shall be demonstrated by the
developer to ensure tree and vegetation preservation. Particular attention shall
be paid to the preservation of trees and their natural understory vegetation on
steep or erodible slopes, riparian areas, wetlands, or other environmentally
sensitive areas. The intent of these regulations is to recognize the need to alter
the landscape during site development activities, while setting out standards
necessary to ensure tree preservation and protection of environmentally
sensitive areas to the greatest extent possible.
(2) Tree survey. The applicant shall submit a tree survey indicating
the species, size, and location of trees within the subject site. Unless otherwise
specified, the survey shall identify by common and scientific name and indicate
by diameter in inches each tree twenty-four inches (24") or greater (or specimen
tree), as measured at four and one-half feet (4.5') above the mean ground level,
as well as other trees proposed for retention. The tree survey shall be prepared
on a topographic survey of the site to establish the tree elevation at the trunk
and shall clearly indicate the drip line of all specimen trees as well as all other
trees to be retained on site and at the edge of the drip line for wooded areas. In
accordance with the Lakeland Tree Management Ordinance, all other trees not
proposed for retention shall be delineated on the survey as a stand and
accompanied by a summary table describing species and size distributions. The
city manager or their designee may grant an exception for trees or wooded areas
that will not be removed or impacted by site development operations.
(3) Trees preserved - plan review determination. The applicant shall
prepare and present a tree management plan and statement of intent at time
the site plan application is submitted for consideration by the planning
commission. The plan shall indicate the location and massing of wooded areas,
areas with dense shrubbery, and isolated individual mature hardwood trees and
designate which areas or trees are to be preserved and which are to be removed.
The plan shall also identify the location of all site improvements, buildings,
general utility locations including easements, and preliminary site grading. The
tree preservation statement shall indicate which trees and wooded areas are to
be protected and the measures proposed to protect them during the construction
process. The planning commission shall have the authority to review and
evaluate the information contained in the management plan and to require
additional protection measures where deemed appropriate to improve
preservation of existing tree cover.
(4) Protection of existing trees. (a) Existing trees and their root
protection zones that arc to be saved shall be protected from all
construction activities, including earthwork operations, movement and
14-92
storage of equipment and vehicles and placement of construction
materials and debris. Erosion protection measures may be required to
prevent siltation of the tree preservation areas during construction.
Protection zones shall be established by the city manager or his/her
designee to ensure trees and their root zones are adequately protected
and are not damaged during site development operations.
(b) Every effort shall be made to locate utility easements away
from tree preservation areas. However, utility easements may be located
adjacent to tree preservation areas as long as adequate clearance and
protection is provided for the tree preservation easement. When
infrastructure systems must cross tree preservation areas, every effort
including consideration of the use of directional boring rather than
trenching shall be made to minimize tree removal in such areas. If the
removal of trees within these areas is determined to be excessive, the city
manager or his/her designee may require the developer to replace such
trees or pay into a tree preservation fund.
(c) To ensure protection of tree preservation areas, protection
zones shall be delineated on the site development plans. During
construction, such protection zones shall be delineated on the property
using standard orange barricade fencing or comparable fencing material
approved by the city forester. Such fencing shall be four feet (4') in height
and supported by metal channel posts spaced at a maximum of ten feet
(10') on center. Such fencing shall be placed around all trees or wooded
areas to be protected and shall remain erected and secure throughout all
construction phases. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and replaced
by Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-905. Landscape islands for existing trees. (1) The planning
commission and design review commission may approve variations to the
landscape island requirements to preserve existing trees in interior parking
areas. For existing trees, the minimum width of a landscape planter island shall
be as follows:
6-inch caliper or less 9-foot minimum width
6-inch to 12-inch caliper 15-foot minimum width
More than 12-inch caliper 20-foot minimum width

14-906. Landscape restrictions - sight triangle standards. (1) A
sight triangle is that area located at the intersection of two (2) public streets or
a public street and private driveway through which an unobstructed view of
approaching traffic is necessary for motorists and pedestrians. Except as
permitted in this section, no landscaping or vegetation, or fence, structure, or
object shall be included in a sight triangle in a landscape plan, nor shall any
such landscaping or object be planted, erected or maintained within a sight
triangle. A sight triangle shall be as defined in Table 9-1 and Figure 9-2 below.
14-94
Figure 9-2. Minimum Required Site Triangle
The distance "D" shall measure twenty feet (20') and fifteen feet (15') from the
edge of the nearest travel lane for a public street and private driveway.
respectively. The distance "L" shall be measured from the centerline of the
minor approach to a point at the edge of the nearest travel lane. The distance
"R" shall be measured from the centerline of the minor street to a point on the

(2) Sight triangles shall be measured from the minor leg of the
intersection of two (2) public streets where the minor approach shall be defined
as that approach whose right-of-way is controlled by a stop sign and whose
major approach is uncontrolled. At a signalized intersection of two (2) public
streets, sight triangles shall be measured for all approaches. For an intersection
of a public street and private driveway, the sight distance is only measured from
the private driveway. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and replaced by
Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-907. Parking lot landscaping requirements. To reduce the visual
impact of parking lots, landscaping areas and/or architectural features that
complement the overall design and character of the development will be
integrated into the development.
(1) The number of trees required in the internal planting areas in
parking lots shall be dependent upon the location of the parking lot in relation
to the building, public right-of-way and adjoining land uses. The following
minimum tree planting requirements shall apply to parking lots:
(a) Where the parking lot is located between the building and
the public right-of-way, one (1) shade tree for every five (5) parking
spaces shall be provided (1:5).
(b) Where the parking lot is located to the side of the building
and partially abuts the public right-of-way, one (1) shade tree for every
seven (7) parking spaces shall be provided (1:7).

deciduous trees a minimum of one (1) tree every thirty (30) linear feet, in
addition to other parking lot landscaping requirements. All landscape aisles and
strips shall be irrigated.
(5) Primary landscape materials shall be trees which provide shade or
are capable of providing shade at maturity. Ornamental trees, evergreen trees,
shrubbery, hedges and other planting materials may be used to compliment the
landscaping, but shall not be the sole means of landscaping. Effective use of
earth berms and existing topography is also encouraged as a component of the
landscape plan.
(6) The perimeter of parking areas along side and rear property lines
not abutting a public right-of-way shall be landscaped using a combination of
evergreen and deciduous plant materials. All perimeter landscape areas shall
be irrigated.
(7) Groundcover plants shall be planted in a number as appropriate
by species to provide fifty percent (50%) surface coverage.
(8) Seeding and sodding shall be provided for total coverage within the
first growing season. Sod shall be used where necessary to provide coverage and
soil stabilization.
(9) Stormwater detention and retention basins and ponds shall be
landscaped. Landscaping materials shall include a combination of deciduous
shade and ornamental trees, coniferous trees, and evergreen and deciduous
shrubbery, hedges and groundcovers. Any areas not covered with tree or
shrubbery materials shall be seeded and/or sodded to minimize sedimentation
within the detention and retention basins and ponds. Depending upon design,
stormwater detention and retention basis landscape may require irrigation.
(10) Walls and raised planters shall not exceed a maximum height of
three feet (3'), unless all of the following are provided:
(a) Screen treatment does not create a traffic or safety hazard
or obstruct visibility.
(b) Portion of treatment that is above three feet (3') in height is
a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) transparent (i.e., wrought iron
fencing, trellis).
(c) Portion of wall/landscape treatment that is above three feet
(3') in height provides added visual interest, detail, and character suitable

enclose parking along a public right-of-way. In addition, the use of razor ribbon
or barbed wire shall be prohibited.
(13) Landscape islands shall be protected by curbs a minimum of six
inches (6") in height. All parking lot islands shall be excavated completely of all
building and paving materials to a minimum depth of twenty-four inches (24")
and backfilled with a medium textured planting mix prior to landscape
materials being planted.
(14) Trees shall be required throughout the life of the development. If
any trees within a parking lot or periphery die, become diseased, or are removed
for any reason, they shall be replaced at the expense of the owner. (as added by
Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and replaced by Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-908. Building facade and foundation landscaping
requirements. (1) Non-residential developments shall include the following
building facade and foundation landscaping standards, unless deviations from
these standards are otherwise approved by the design review commission as
part of the landscape plan approval process:
(a) Landscaping and planting areas shall be placed to provide
a buffer between the parking lot or drives and building walls or
pedestrian circulation. Landscape areas may be placed adjacent to the
building wall or adjacent to the curb to coordinate with building
overhangs and canopies, if applicable. A variety of shrubs, ornamental
trees and/or shade trees are encouraged. Any trees used should
accommodate pedestrian circulation.
(b) Along any building facade or foundation that fronts upon a
public right-of-way or a parking lot provided for the building, landscape
areas shall be provided equivalent to a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of
each building facade or foundation. The landscape area may be a
continuous area or comprised of several areas. Building facades along
service areas are excluded but, shall be screened according to applicable
screening requirements of such areas.
(c) Each landscape area shall be planted with shrubbery a
minimum of thirty (30") inches in height at time of planting that is of a
species capable of reaching thirty-six (36") inches in height above the
adjacent parking area or drive, covering a minimum of seventy-five
percent (75%) of the length of the landscape area. A mixture of evergreen
and deciduous shrubs shall be used to maintain seasonal interest.
Ornamental trees (where appropriate), or shade trees should be included
in the landscape design to further buffer the building facade from the
drives and parking lot areas. In areas where pedestrian circulation is
anticipated, trees with a branching habit conducive to walking under
shall be used. For example, pin oaks are not acceptable in these areas due
to their descending branch habit. Consideration should also be given to
14-98
the presence of thorns, fruit, or other features that will affect pedestrian
circulation. Appropriate plant species should be installed so that mature
tree limbs can be maintained at a minimum eight foot (8') clearance from
ground level and so that shrubs do not exceed thirty-six inches (36") in
height for areas where it is important to maintain visibility for security
and safety purposes.
(d) Planting areas shall have a minimum width of either six feet
(6') or the equivalent of twenty percent (20%) of the building facade
height as measured from finished grade to the top of the wall or parapet,
whichever is greater.
(e) Building facade and foundation areas shall be irrigated.
Bubbler or drip irrigation systems are encouraged in order to reduce
water consumption and overspray onto pedestrian circulation areas.
(f) Landscape areas shall generally not be placed beneath
overhangs and canopies. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and
replaced by Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-909. Slope plantings. Landscaping of all cuts and fills and/or
terraces shall be sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes steeper
than one foot (1') vertically to three feet (3') horizontally shall be planted with
groundcover appropriate for the purposes and soil conditions, water availability
and surrounding environment. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and
replaced by Ord. #07-100, Feb. 2007)
14-910. Removal of debris. (1) All stumps and other tree parts, litter,
brush, weeds, excess or scrap building materials or other debris shall be
completely removed from the site prior to issuance of a certificate of completion
by the city.
(2) No tree stumps, or portions of tree trunks or limbs shall be buried
anywhere in the development.
(3) All dead and dying trees, standing or fallen, shall be completely
removed from the site upon notification by the city. If trees or limbs are reduced
to chips, they may be used as mulch in landscape areas, subject to approval by
the city. (as added by Ord. #04-68, Sept. 2004 and replaced by Ord. #07-100,
Feb. 2007)
14-911. Plant materials. (1) Quality standard. All plant material
shall be of No. 1 grade, free from plant disease, of typical growth for the species,
have a healthy, normal root system, rounded branch pattern, and shall be
installed in conformance to the code of standards set forth in the most recent
edition of The American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1), as published
by the American Association of Nurserymen.
(2) There shall be a minimum of one (1) shade tree for every three (3)
understory trees planted. There shall be no more than forty percent (40%) from
14-99
one (1) genus unless otherwise approved by the city manager or his/her
designee.
(3) Recommended plants. A list of recommended plants within each
plant material type is included in Table 9-2. The applicant may propose plants
other than those listed if the plant is appropriate for the intended use or the
applicant maintains a plant care program sufficient to properly care for the
proposed plant material. Plant materials shall be appropriate for the region and
local soil conditions and shall be planted in accordance with good horticultural
practice. Plants selected should require only low maintenance and should be
temperature and drought tolerant.

encourage lighting practices and systems that will minimize light pollution,
glare, light trespass; conserve energy and resources while maintaining
night-time safety, utility, security and productivity; and curtail the degradation
of the night time visual environment. The purpose of this section is to establish
regulations to allow for outdoor illumination levels that are appropriate for the
visual task, safety and security while minimizing the undesirable side effects of
excessive illumination such as glare, sky glow and light pollution. Over time, it
is the intent that this section will allow for reasonably uniform illumination
levels in the community. It is also the purpose of this section to establish design
criteria for outdoor lighting fixtures that will enhance the visual and aesthetic
character of the City of Lakeland. (as added by Ord. #04-69, Sept. 2004, and
replaced by Ord. #07-101, Feb. 2007)
14-1002. Applicability. (1) New uses. All proposed new land uses,
developments, buildings, structures, or building additions of twenty-five percent

capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein, either with a single
addition or cumulative additions subsequent to the effective date of this chapter,
shall meet the requirements of this chapter for the entire property. This
includes additions which increase the total number of required parking spaces
by twenty-five percent (25%) or more. For all building additions of less than
14-113
twenty-five percent (25%) cumulative, the applicant shall only have to meet the
requirements of this chapter for any new outdoor lighting provided.
(2) Change in use/intensity. Except as provided in subsection (3)
below, whenever the use of any existing building, structure, premises is changed
to a new use, or the intensity of use is increased through the incorporation of
additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of
measurement specified herein, and which change in use or intensification of use
creates a need for increase in the total number of required parking spaces of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more, either with a single change or cumulative
changes subsequent to the effective date of these provisions, then all outdoor
lighting facilities shall meet the requirements of this chapter for the entire
property, to the maximum extent possible as determined by the design review
commission. For changes of use or intensity which require an increase in
parking of less than twenty-five percent (25%) cumulative, the applicant shall
only have to meet the requirements of this chapter for any new outdoor lighting
provided.
(3) Nonconforming uses, structures or lots. Whenever a
nonconforming use, structure or lot is abandoned for a period of ninety (90)
consecutive days and then changed to a new use, then any existing outdoor
lighting shall be reviewed and brought into compliance as necessary for the
entire building, structure or premises, to the maximum extent possible as
determined by the design review commission.
No outdoor lighting fixture which was lawfully installed prior to
enactment of this chapter shall be required to be removed or modified except as
expressly provided herein; provided, however, no modification or replacement
shall be made to a nonconforming fixture unless the fixture thereafter conforms
to the provisions of this chapter.
In the event that any nonconforming sign, as to lighting, is abandoned or
is damaged, and the damage exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the replacement
value, exclusive of foundations, to replace it, the sign shall be brought into
conformance with the provisions of this chapter with respect to lighting as well
as applicable provisions of the sign ordinance. (as added by Ord. #04-69, Sept.
2004, and replaced by Ord. #07-101, Feb. 2007)

14-116
(3) Wherever practicable, it is encouraged that lighting installations
include timers, dimmers, and/or sensors to reduce overall energy consumption
and unnecessary lighting. Uses that can turn off their outdoor lighting during
night hours are to be encouraged in residential districts with those requiring all
night illumination to be discouraged where appropriate.
(4) Exterior lighting installations shall be designed to avoid harsh
contrasts in lighting levels.
(5) Outdoor floodlighting by flood light projection above the horizontal
plane is prohibited.
(6) All light fixtures including street lights, shall be located, aimed or

Example of Full Cut-off Fixture as Defined by IESNA.
(12) Lighting should meet the minimum IESNA standards in providing
illumination and shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the
recommended values without specific written approval by the design review
commission. Site lighting shall be designed as part of the architecture and
landscaping themes of the site. Lighting should provide for appropriate and
desirable nighttime illumination for all uses on and related to the site to
promote a safe environment for inhabitants.
(13) Reference IESNA Recommended Practices RP-6 (Sports), RP-8
(Roadway), RP-20 (Parking Facilities) and RP-33 (Exterior Environment) for

onto neighboring properties. Light pollution control shall be required to
minimize the negative effect of misdirected upward lighting.
(16) Where feasible, additional landscaping may be required by the
design review commission to provide light screening between non-residential
uses and residential districts to help prevent light spillage. Where landscaping
14-118
is used for light screening, the design review commission shall take into
consideration the applicable landscaping standards found elsewhere in these
regulations, the design standards found elsewhere in these regulations, the
creation of excessive shadows or dark spaces, and views into and out of a site.
(17) Vegetation and landscaping shall be maintained in a manner that
does not obstruct security lighting and minimizes possible entrapment spaces.
(18) To minimize the indiscriminate use of illumination, it is
recommended that outdoor lighting, except as required for security, be
extinguished during nonoperating hours,
(19) Upward lighting of building facades, monument signs up to six feet
(6') tall, and outdoor artwork is permissible so long as the lighting is aimed
directly at the object to be illuminated, not aimed into the sky, and light spillage
is avoided. Signs mounted at a height greater than six feet (6') from the ground

14-1006. Total outdoor light output. The maximum total amount of
light, measured in lumens, shall be calculated from all outdoor light fixtures.
For lamp types that vary in their output as they age (such as metal halide), the
initial output, as defined by the manufacturer, is the value to be considered. For
determining compliance with this chapter, the light emitted from outdoor light
fixtures is to be included in the total output as follows:
(1) Outdoor light fixtures installed on poles (such as parking lot
luminaires) and light fixtures installed on the sides of buildings or other
structures, when not shielded from above the structure itself as defined in
subsections (2) and (3) below, are to be included in the total outdoor light output
by simply adding the lumen outputs of the lamps used;
(2) Outdoor light fixtures installed under canopies, building
overhangs, or roof eaves where the center of the lamp or luminaire is located at
least five feet (5') but less than ten feet (10') from the nearest edge of the canopy
or overhang are to be included in the total outdoor light output as though they
produced only one-quarter (1/4) of the lamp's rated lumen output;
(3) Outdoor light fixtures located under the canopy and ten (10) or
more feet from the nearest edge of a canopy, building overhang, or eave are to
be included in the total outdoor light output as though they produced only
one-tenth (1/10) of the lamp's rated lumen output. (as added by Ord. #04-69,
Sept. 2004, and replaced by Ord. #07-101, Feb. 2007)

to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of
buildings and provide visual interest that will be consistent with the
community's identity, character and scale. The intent is to encourage a more
human scale that residents of Lakeland will be able to identify with their
community. The resulting scale will ensure a greater likelihood of reuse of
structures by subsequent tenants.
(1) Buildings with facades less than one hundred (100') feet in linear
length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of two (2') feet
in depth and a minimum of ten (10) contiguous feet within each thirty (30') feet
of facade length. The street level facade of such buildings shall be transparent
between the height of three (3') feet and eight (8') feet above the walkway grade
for no less than sixty (60%) percent of the horizontal length of the building
facade. Windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent sills,
shutters, or other such forms of framing. The remaining forty (40%) percent of
the street level facade shall use animating features such as arcades, display
windows, entry areas, or awnings.
(2) Buildings with facades one hundred feet (100') or more in linear
length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of three feet (3')
and a minimum of twenty (20) contiguous feet within each one hundred (100)
linear feet of facade length and shall extend over twenty (20%) percent of the
facade. Buildings shall use animated features such as arcades, display windows,
entry areas, or awnings along at least sixty (60%) percent of the facade. (as
added by Ord. #04-07, Sept. 2004, and replaced by Ord. #07-102, Feb. 2007)
14-1106. Detail features. (1) Buildings should have architectural
features and patterns that provide visual interests, at the scale of the
pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The
elements in the following standard should be integral parts of the building
fabric, and not superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint.
(a) Building facades shall include a repeating pattern that shall
include no less than three of the elements listed below. At least one (1) of
these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall repeat at
intervals of no more than thirty feet (30'), either horizontally or vertically.
(i) Color change;
(ii) Texture change;
(iii) Material module change;
14-130
(iv) Expression of architecture or structural bay through
a change in plane no less than eighteen inches (18") in width, such
as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib.
14-131
(b) Roofs. Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest
to, and reduce the massive scale of large buildings. Roof features should
compliment the character of adjoining neighborhoods.
(i) Roof lines shall be varied with a change in height
everyone hundred (100) linear feet in the building length.
Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs, or donners shall be
used to conceal flat roofs and roof top mechanical equipment from
public view. Alternating lengths and designs may be acceptable
upon approval by the design review commission.
Figure 11.2
Example of Varying Rooflines and Architectural Detailing
14-132
(iii) Roof materials. Roof materials shall compliment the
building architecture. Architectural shingle, metal, and other
forms of metal roofing are considered acceptable roofing materials
for non-residential construction applications. Rubberized
membrane roofing is acceptable so long as it is not visible from the
public right-of-way or adjoining residential properties.
(c) Materials and colors. Exterior building materials and colors
comprise a significant part of the visual impact of a building. Therefore,
they should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and
colors used in adjoining neighborhoods.
(i) Predominant exterior building materials shall be high
quality materials. These include, but are not limited to, the
following materials:
(A) Brick;
(B) Sandstone;
(C) Other native stone;
(D) Tinted, textured, concrete masonry units;
(E) Stucco;
(F) Treated and stained wood (including
cementous board materials).
(ii) Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral,
or earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic
colors, black or fluorescent colors is prohibited.
(iii) Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter
colors, but neon tubing is prohibited for building trim or accent
areas.
(iv) Predominant exterior building materials as well as
architectural accents should not include the following:
(A) Smooth-faced concrete block;
(B) Tilt-up concrete panels (smooth finish);
(C) Pre-fabricated steel panels;
(D) Untreated wood.
(d) Entryways. Entryway design elements and variations
should give orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the
building. The standards identify desirable entryway design features.
(i) Each principal building on a site shall have clearly
defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than
four (4) of the following:
(A) Canopies or porticos;
(B) Overhangs;
(C) Recesses/projections;
(D) Arcades;
(E) Raised corniced parapets over the door;
(F) Peaked roof forms;
14-133
(G) Arches;
(H) Outdoor patios;
(I) Display windows;
(J) Architectural details such as tile work and
moldings which are integrated into the building structure
and design;
(K) Integral planters or wing walls that
incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting.
(e) Entrances for large retail establishments. Large retail
establishments containing more than one hundred thousand (100,000)
square feet of gross leasable floor area should feature multiple entrances.
Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from automobiles,
facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and
provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual
stores, or identified departments in a store. Multiple entrances also
mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often
characterize building facades that face bordering land uses.
(i) All sides of a principal building that directly face an
abutting public right-of-way shall feature at least one (1) customer
entrance. Where a principal building directly faces more than two
(2) abutting public rights-of-way, this requirement shall apply only
to two (2) sides of the building, including the side of the building
facing the primary street, and another side of the building facing
a secondary street.
(ii) The number of entrances for the principal building
shall be addressed during the review of the preliminary
development plan. Where additional stores or offices will be located
in the principal building, each such store shall have at least one (1)
exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above
requirements.
(iii) The rear or sides of buildings often present an
unattractive view of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas,
mechanical units and meters, garbage receptacles, and other such
features. Architectural and landscaping features should be utilized
to mitigate these impacts. Any back or side of a building visible
from a public street or residential district shall be designed in
accordance with provisions governing front facades of buildings
relative to facades and exterior walls, detail features, roofs, and
materials and colors.
(A) Where the facade faces adjacent residential
uses an earthen berm shall be installed, no less than six feet
(6') in height, containing at a minimum, a double row of
evergreen trees planted at intervals of fifteen feet (15') on
14-134
center. Deciduous trees may only be used for visual interest
on the berm.
(B) Additional landscaping may be required by the
design review commission to effectively buffer adjacent
residential land uses as deemed appropriate.
14-135
(f) Screening requirements for mechanical systems, outdoor storage
and trash collection areas. Outdoor storage areas and trash collection facilities
often exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding property. These areas,
when visible from adjoining property and/or public streets, should be screened,
recessed or enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate
impacts, the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the
impacts to adjoining property. Appropriate locations for outdoor storage areas
including areas between buildings, where more than one building is located on
a site and such buildings are not more than forty feet (40') apart, or on those
sides of building that do not have customer entrances.
(i) Unattractive elements such as outdoor storage, trash
collection or compaction, truck parking and loading areas are to be
located out of public view from streets, adjacent residential
property, and other highly visible areas such as parking lot access
drives.
(ii) No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or
compaction, loading, or other such uses shall only be located in a
side or rear yard and shall not be within twenty feet (20') of any
internal sidewalk or pedestrian way.
(iii) Refuse collection areas shall be fully enclosed and
screened from public view on at least three (3) sides with a six to
eight foot (6'-8') opaque screen of masonry or equivalent material
similar to the primary building material used on the principal
structure and shall be supplemented with evergreen trees and
shrubbery that blend into the overall landscape treatment for the
development
(iv) Outdoor storage, utility meters, HVAC and other
mechanical equipment, trash dumpsters and receptacles, trash
compaction, and other service functions shall be incorporated into
the overall design of the building and the landscaping so that the
visual and acoustical impacts of these functions are fully contained
and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets, and no
attention is attracted to the functions by the use of screening
materials that are different from or inferior to the principal
materials of the building and landscaping.
(v) Exterior ground-mounted or building-mounted
equipment including, but not limited to, mechanical equipment,
utilities' meter banks and coolers shall be screened from public
view with landscaping or with an architectural treatment
compatible with the building architecture.
(vi) Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of
seasonal inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with
walls and/or fences. Materials, colors and design of screening walls
and/or fences and the cover shall conform to those used as
14-136
predominant materials and colors of the building. If such areas are
to be covered, then the covering shall conform to those used as
predominant materials and colors on the building.
(vii) All roof-top equipment shall be screened from public
view with an architectural treatment which is compatible with the
building architecture and integral to the overall appearance of the
building. The methods of screening of rooftop equipment include,
but are not limited to, encasement or partition screens. Equipment
screens shall be required at a height that is as high as or higher
than the equipment being screened. After submittal of justification
and careful analysis (i.e., site line visibility study), the design
review commission may grant exceptions to the screening
requirements if one of the following exception criteria is valid.
(A) A building is located at a high elevation in
relation to surrounding properties and it is demonstrated
that rooftop equipment will not be visible.
(B) A building is located in the middle of a
commercial or office development and the rooftop equipment
is not visible from arterial or collector right-of-ways,
residential properties, nor will it have a negative impact
upon any sensitive areas or scenic view or vistas.
(C) A building is sited in a manner where the
location and setback of rooftop equipment from the building
edge in relation to the elevation and visibility of
surrounding properties is such that the equipment will not
be visible from any distance and additional screening
measures are not required. (as added by Ord. #04-07, Sept.
2004, and replaced by Ord. #07-102, Feb. 2007)
14-1107. Mixed use developments. To allow the desired mixing and
integration of uses, streetscapes, and innovative design treatments for mixed
use or traditional neighborhood design developments, these design guidelines
may be waived, so long as the development is a planned development, and so
long as the development complies with all prior approvals of the City of
Lakeland. All waived portions of the guidelines must be specifically identified
in writing and approved by the planning commission, or the applicable design
guidelines of this chapter shall apply. (as added by Ord. #07-102, Feb. 2007)

variance from certain conditions of this section must first request a hearing
before the board of appeals. The board of appeals shall not grant a variance
unless it makes findings based upon evidence presented to it as follows:
(a) Physical or topographical conditions. The particular
physical surroundings, shape, or topographic conditions of the specific
property involved would-result in a particular hardship upon the owner,
as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict application of
the section were carried out;
(b) Relationship to other properties within the district. The
conditions upon which the petition for variance is based would not be
applicable, generally, to other property within the same district;

in the residential zoning district other than those provided for in this
section;

financial considerations;

has not been created by any person having an interest in the property
after the effective date of this section;

this applicant a special privilege that is denied by this section to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same residential district;
(g) Minimum variance required. The variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible reasonable use of the land.
(h) Effect on public welfare. Granting the variance will not be
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the area in which the subject property is located.
(i) Effect on adjacent property. The variance will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially
increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire,
15-20
endanger the public safety, adversely impact drainage or create erosion,
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the area.
(j) Nonconforming status. The variance is not based on the
presence of non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings in the same residential district.
(k) Prohibited uses. Under no circumstance shall the board of
appeals1 grant a variance to allow a use not permitted under the terms
of this section or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this section or other regulations of the City of Lakeland.
(l) Conditions of variance. The board of appeals may impose
such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a
variance as may be necessary to reduce or minimize the injurious effect
of such variation upon surrounding property including, but not limited to,
requiring additional landscaping and screening measures, and better
carry out the general intent of this section.
(10) Private restrictive covenants effect. This section shall not create
a right to park and/or store recreational vehicles and/or equipment where
otherwise prohibited by private restrictive covenants.
(11) Bona fide farming operations on agricultural zoned property
excepted. The provisions of this section shall not apply to vehicles and
equipment used in bona fide farming operations on agriculturally zoned
property when such vehicles and equipment are parked on property zoned for
agricultural uses.

provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance
is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall
not affect other provisions or applications of this section that can be given effect
without the invalid provision or application.

provision of this section shall be fined an amount not to exceed fifty dollars
($50.00) for each offense, and a separate offense shall be deemed committed for
each day in which each separate violation continues. (as added by Ord. #03-24,

16-207. Protection of existing improvements. The applicant shall
be responsible for the protection, repair or replacement of all improvements

following: water lines, sanitary and storm sewer lines, street lighting, traffic
signal systems, traffic signs, topsoil, sod, trees, public utility lines and systems,

protective planking, pads or other methods meeting the approval of the city
engineer. In the event any portion of the street is damaged as a result of the
applicant's operations, the applicant shall be responsible for the repair or
replacement thereof in accordance with the directions of the city engineer. (as
added by Ord. #08-123, Nov. 2008)
16-208. Performance of work. (1) All work performed and materials
used pursuant to the issuance of a road cut permit shall be in accordance with
the City of Lakeland Manual for Public Works Construction and Materials
Specifications.
(2) Where trench structure excavation requires the removal of curb
gutter, concrete sidewalks, or asphaltic or concrete pavement by means of
backhoes, graders or loaders, the asphalt or concrete shall be cut in a straight
line parallel to the edge of the excavation by the use of a spade bitted air
hammer, concrete saw, or similar approved equipment, to obtain a straight
vertical edge before any excavating has begun.
(3) When trench excavation is performed by a trencher, asphalt
pavement need not be cut prior to excavating operations. However, should
trenching operations begin to pull, lift and/or tear existing asphalt pavement,
the trenching operation shall be discontinued until the asphalt is cut parallel to
the edge of the excavation. The city engineer or his/her designee shall retain sole
authority to determine whether the asphalt shall be cut prior to any excavating.
The minimum width of pavement removal for utilities greater than six feet (6')
in depth shall not be less than eight feet (8'), unless otherwise approved by the
16-8
city engineer. All necessary corners shall be cut at not more than a forty-five
degree (45E) angle to the trench excavation.

and remove both edges of the asphalt or concrete pavement, one foot (1') wider
than the edge of the excavation. The cutting method shall be similar to that
previously described.
(6) Rotomilling may be substituted instead of trimming asphalt or
concrete pavement as outlined in subsection (3) above. This work shall include
rotomilling both trench edges twelve inches wide to a depth no less than one and
one-half inches (1 1/2"). Rotomilling of trench edges shall not be considered an
approved option if the trench excavation material is of a noncohesive property
and undermines any edge of the existing asphalt pavement.
(7) Upon completion of the work, all surplus construction materials
and debris shall be removed, leaving the entire site free, clean, and in a neat
condition.
(8) The applicant or his agent shall be responsible for the removal and
replacement of the concrete curb, gutter, sidewalk, and pavement, and such
shall be made within seven (7) working days after backfill is completed, weather
permitting.
(9) All excavation, backfilling and resurfacing work shall be performed
by the applicant or his agent. Upon completion of the work, the applicant or his
agent shall give immediate notice to the city engineer that such work has been
completed.
(10) The applicant shall assume the responsibility for any damage to
underground facilities caused by the trenching, backfilling, boring, resurfacing,
or any other activities of the work.
(11) All topsoil and sod removed by the contractor shall be replaced.
(12) When making excavations, the various materials excavated shall
be piled separately. All concrete and bituminous materials, any soils which
cannot be properly compacted, and all other deleterious materials shall be
removed from the construction site and properly disposed of in accordance with
applicable laws.
(13) All materials used for backfilling shall be compactable so as to meet
the minimum density and moisture requirements spelled out in the city's
construction standards. Backfill material may contain coarse materials up to six
inches in diameter, but shall be free from large pieces of rock, frozen material,
concrete, roots, stumps, tin cans, rubbish, and other similar articles whose
presence in the backfill would, in the opinion of the city engineer or his/her
designee, cause settlement of the trench or damage to the installed
improvement. Material shall have a maximum plasticity index of six (6) and not
exhibit pumping characteristics when proof rolled.
16-9
(14) As a condition of the permit, the applicant shall guarantee his work
for a period of one (1) year from the date of final completion of the work. If
settlement equal to or greater than one-half inch (1/2") or pavement separation
equal to or greater than one-quarter inch (1/4") occurs at the site of the
excavation, or immediately adjacent thereto, at any time within one (1) year
from the date of final completion of the original restoration, the applicant shall
be responsible for repairing such settled or separated areas in accordance with
the directions of the city engineer. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible
for reimbursing the city for any expenses incurred in the placement of warning
devices and barricades for the protection of traffic due to such settlement. (as
added by Ord. #08-123, Nov. 2008)
16-209. Routing traffic and street closure. The applicant or his
agent shall take appropriate measures to assure that, during the performance
of the excavation work, traffic conditions shall be maintained, as nearly normal
as practicable, at all times. A traffic control plan shall be submitted with the
permit application and shall include a sketch showing traffic routing, placement
and type of traffic control devices to be used, a statement of the reason for the
work, and the time during which the work is to be performed. The applicant or
his agent shall route and control traffic, including his own vehicles, as per the
latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and
Highways, published by the Federal Highway Administration. Excavations
which traverse a street shall be limited to one-half (1/2) the width of the street
at anyone time, unless an emergency situation exists which requires that the
entire width of the street be excavated. The city engineer may permit the closing
of streets to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him if, in his opinion, it
is necessary. (as added by Ord. #08-123, Nov. 2008)
16-210. Time limitations. All work covered under this chapter shall be
accomplished expeditiously until completion, in order to avoid unnecessary
inconvenience to traffic, to pedestrians, and for the protection of other public
interests. The applicant shall state, in his application for permit, the time which
he estimates will be required to complete the work. Upon review of the
application, the city engineer shall have the right to amend the time requested
and issue the permit so as to allow the minimum amount of time which he
determines will reasonably be required for such work. The time allowed for
completion shall be extended as necessary if it is found that it is not possible to
complete the work within the time allowed. In the event that the work is not
being accomplished expeditiously in accordance with the time period set forth
in the permit, or if the work on an excavation has ceased or is abandoned
without due cause, the city engineer may, after ten (10) working days from date
of receipt, give written notice to the holder of the permit of the city's intention
to do so, have city forces correct the work, backfill the excavation, and effect all
restoration as required by this chapter. In the event settlement of an excavation
16-10
occurs within one (1) year of the date of final restoration and the applicant is
notified of such settlement or pavement separation, he shall accomplish the
required restoration or repair within the time limit specified hereunder.
Thereafter, if the work has not been accomplished, the city engineer may have
city forces accomplish the work required. The entire cost of such work, including
any materials used therefore, shall be paid to the city by the applicant of the
permit upon demand. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days of the
demand, no additional permits shall be issued to the applicant until payment
has been made by the applicant or by his bonding company. In addition, the city
may proceed to collect any of the costs due and owing in any manner allowed by
law. (as added by Ord. #08-123, Nov. 2008)

(d) Any wastewater containing any toxic pollutants, chemical
elements, or compounds in sufficient quantity, either singly or by
interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any
wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals,
create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the
limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic
pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified
pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
18-29
(e) Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which
either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create
a public nuisance, hazard to life, are sufficient to prevent entry into the
sewers for maintenance and repair.
(f) Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any
other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation
process. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the
POTW to be in non-compliance with sludge use or under Section 405 of
the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or
disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean
Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to
the sludge management method being used.
(g) Any substances which will cause the POTW to violate its
NPDES Permit or the receiving water quality standards.
(h) Any wastewater causing discoloration of the wastewater
treatment plant effluent to the extent that the receiving stream water
quality requirements would be violated, such as, but not limited to, dye
wastes and vegetable tanning solutions.
(i) Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference,
but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the
sewer system which exceeds 65EC (150EF) or causes the influent at the
wastewater plant to exceed 40EC (104EF).
(j) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants
(BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which
a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW.
(k) Any waters or wastes causing an unusual volume of flow or
concentration of waste constituting "slug" as defined herein.
(l) Any waters containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such halflife or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city
in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
(m) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or
creates a public nuisance.
(n) Any waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or oil,
whether emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/l or
containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at
temperature between thirty-two (32) or one hundred fifty (150) degrees
F (0 and 65EC).
(o) Any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff,
subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted
industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Stormwater and all
other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are
specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved
18-30
by the city and the Tennessee Department of Health. Industrial cooling
water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval of the
city and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,
to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
(2) Restrictions on wastewater strength. No person or user shall
discharge wastewater which exceeds the following set of standards (Table A -
User Discharge Restrictions) unless an exception is permitted as provided in
this chapter. Dilution of any wastewater discharge for the purpose of satisfying
these requirements shall be considered in violation of this chapter.

(3) Protection of treatment plant influent. The city may monitor the
treatment works influent for each parameter in the following table. (Table B -
Plant Protection Criteria). Industrial users shall be subject to reporting and
monitoring requirements regarding these parameters as set forth in this
chapter. In the event that the influent at the POTW reaches or exceeds the
levels established by this table, the city shall initiate technical studies to
determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend to the city
18-31
the necessary remedial measures, including, but not limited to, recommending
the establishment of new or revised pre-treatment levels for these parameters.
The city shall also recommend changes to any of these criteria in the event that:
the POTW effluent standards are changed, there are changes in any applicable
law or regulation affecting same, or changes are needed for more effective
operation of the POTW.

(4) Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the
promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular
industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations
imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately
supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The city shall notify all
affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section
403.12.
(5) Right to establish more restrictive criteria. No statement in this
chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the city from establishing
specific wastewater discharge criteria more restrictive where wastes are
determined to be harmful or destructive to the facilities of the POTW or to
create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge of the POTW to violate
effluent or stream quality standards, or to interfere with the use or handling of
sludge, or to pass through the POTW resulting in a violation of the NPDES
permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards for discharge to
municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed or as may be imposed by
the Tennessee Department of Health and/or the United States Environmental
Protection Agency.
(6) Accidental discharges. (a) Protection from accidental discharge.
All industrial users shall provide such facilities and institute such
procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the
potential for accidental discharge into the POTW of waste regulated by
this chapter from liquid or raw material storage areas, from truck and
rail car loading and unloading areas, from in-plant transfer or processing
and materials handling areas, and from diked areas or holding ponds of
any waste regulated by this chapter. Detailed plans showing the facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city before the facility
is constructed.
The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
(b) Notification of accidental discharge. Any person causing or
suffering from any accidental discharge shall immediately notify the city
(or designated official) in person, or by the telephone to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the city to minimize damage to the
POTW, the health and welfare of the public, and the environment.
This notification shall be followed, within five (5) days of the date
of occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future
occurrence.
Such notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any
expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
18-33
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
chapter or state or federal law.
(c) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted
on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
In lieu of placing notices on bulletin boards, the users may submit an
approved SPIC. Each user shall annually certify to the city compliance
with this paragraph.
18-408. Industrial user monitoring, inspection reports, records
access, and safety. (1) Monitoring facilities. The installation of a monitoring
facility shall be required for all industrial users. A monitoring facility shall be
a manhole or other suitable facility approved by the city.
When in the judgment of the city, there is a significant difference in
wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of
a single user the city may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed
for each separate source of discharge.
Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed
and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user.
If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the city, it shall be
provided and installed at the user's expense.
The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The city may, however, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the
facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with the approval of
the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way and located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expenses of the user.
(2) Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative
ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose
of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of
their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set
up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user
18-34
has security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of perform in their specific
responsibility.
(3) Compliance date report. Within 180 days following the date for
final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the city a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily
flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a professional engineer
registered to practice engineering in Tennessee.
(4) Periodic compliance reports. (a) Any user subject to a
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the
discharge into the POTW, shall summit to the city during the months of
June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment
standard or by the city, a report indicating the nature and concentration
of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment
standards and requirements.
In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows
which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow. At
the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as local high
or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may agree to alter
the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
(b) The city may impose mass limitations on users where the
imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. in such cases, the report
required by subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall indicate the mass
of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the
user.
(c) The reports required by this section shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration or production and mass where requested by the
city of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed
18-35
in the wastewater discharge permit or the pretreatment standard. All
analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by
the administrator pursuant to Section 304 (g) of the Act and contained in
40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with techniques approved by the administrator.
(5) Maintenance of records. Any industrial user subject to the
reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all
information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section.
Such records shall include for all samples:
(a) The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the persons taking the samples;
(b) The dates analyses were performed;
(c) Who performed the analyses;
(d) The analytical techniques/methods used; and
(e) The results of such analyses.
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement established in
this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years all
records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring
activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for
inspection and copying by the city, Director of the Division of Water Quality
Control, Tennessee Department of Health or the Environmental Protection
Agency. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or when requested by the
city, the approval authority, or the Environmental Protection Agency.
(6) Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties,
the city or duly authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the company and the company shall
be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city shall
indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city employees
and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the company and growing out of the monitoring and sampling
operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company
to maintain safe conditions.
18-409. Enforcement and abatement. (1) Issuance of cease and
desist orders. When the city finds that a discharge of wastewater has taken
place in violation of prohibitions or limitations of this chapter, or the provisions
of a wastewater discharge permit, the city shall issue an order to cease and
desist, and direct that these persons not complying with such prohibitions,
limits requirements, or provisions to:
(a) Comply immediately;
(b) Comply in accordance with a time schedule set forth by the
city;
18-36
(c) Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event
of a threatened violation; or
(d) Surrender the applicable user's permit if ordered to do so
after a show cause hearing.
Failure of the city to issue a cease and desist order to a violating user
shall not in any way relieve the User from any consequences of a wrongful or
illegal discharge.
(2) Submission of time schedule. When the city finds that a discharge
of wastewater has been taking place in violation of prohibitions or limitations
prescribed in this chapter, or wastewater source control requirements, effluent

18A707. Severability.
18-701. Purpose and scope. (1) The city has the authority to enact
this chapter pursuant to state statutes.
(2) The purpose of this chapter is to provide developers oversizing
reimbursements for the oversizing of wastewater collection systems.
(3) This chapter shall apply to all city-owned or controlled wastewater
collection facilities and systems within the city limits of Lakeland.
(4) This chapter does not apply to other governmental entities or
agencies that own) operate, and maintain their own wastewater collection
systems.
(5) This chapter does not apply to privately-owned wastewater
collection systems connected to the city systems. (as added by Ord. #08-127,
Dec. 2008)
18-702. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the
interpretation of this chapter:
(1) "City" means the governing body of the City of Lakeland, Tennessee
(2) "Developer" means any individual, person, subdivision, or other
legal entity that must construct and/or extend wastewater collection facilities
for system or project improvements.
(3) "City manager" means the city manager or his/her appointed
designee.
(4) "Master plans" means the currently adopted wastewater collection
system master plan, and the comprehensive land use plan developed for the city
which may indicate the size and conceptual location of wastewater collection
mains in order to service future expansion of the city.
(5) "Oversizing reimbursement" means payment to a developer for the
oversizing costs of wastewater collection systems above the size required to
serve the proposed and potential development.
(6) "Oversized wastewater collection mains" means generally
wastewater collection mains over ten inches (10") in diameter and are required
by the adjacent land use, master plan or system improvements.
18-66
(7) "Project improvements" means wastewater facilities that are
planned and designed to provide service for a particular development project,
and are necessary for the use and convenience for the occupants or users for
such project, and are not considered system improvements to be considered for
over-sizing reimbursement by the city as otherwise provided herein. The
character of the improvements shall control the determination of whether an
improvement is a project improvement or a system improvement, and a physical
location of the improvement on-site or off-site shall not be considered
determinative of whether an improvement is a project improvement or system
improvement. If an improvement or facility provides, or will provide, more than
incidental service or facilities to persons other than the user occupants of a
particular project, the improvement or facility is a system improvement and
shall not be considered a project improvement.
(8) "System improvements" means capital improvements that are
wastewater facility improvements which are designed to provide service to the
community-at-large in contrast to project improvements for a particular
development. (as added by Ord. #08-127, Dec. 2008)
18-703. Over-sizing requirements. The oversizing of wastewater
collection systems shall be based upon the city's master plans. However, the city
reserves the right to specify sizes and locations of all sewer mains, including
those not otherwise delineated by the master plans.
(1) All developers shall develop and plan for wastewater collection
systems in accordance with the requirements of the city, and for the sizing and
location of such system improvements.
(2) The developer, at its sole expense, shall furnish and install all
wastewater collection systems in the project. The city shall compensate the
developer for over-sizing of wastewater collection systems as provided herein.
(a) The city, in requiring the oversizing of wastewater collection
systems, may consider the following:
(i) The developer shall provide a wastewater collection
system analysis performed by an engineer in accordance with
design requirements established by the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation and the city. The wastewater
system hydraulic analysis shall be approved by the city engineer
to be acceptable for serving the developer's project and all
surrounding lands also owned by the developer and/or other
partnerships or corporations in which the developer has an
interest.
(ii) Whether oversizing corrects wastewater collection not
identified in the appropriate master plan.
(iii) Whether oversizing corrects wastewater collection
system deficiencies identified in the appropriate master plan or as
identified by the city.
18-67
(iv) Whether the project promotes infill or extension of
oversized wastewater collection systems located within or adjacent
to the city limits.
(v) Wastewater collection system deficiencies shall be
determined solely by the city.
(3) A developer shall, as solely determined and directed by the city,
install oversized wastewater collection mains, when sizing may not necessarily
be in concurrence with the master plans adopted by the city. (as added by
Ord. #08-127, Dec. 2008)
18-704. Oversizing reimbursement and recapture provisions.
(1) An oversizing reimbursement shall be available to the developer
for oversizing wastewater collection systems as required by the city to be
installed in a project or development. Oversizing reimbursement provisions shall
be contained in a development contract with the developer.
(2) The developer shall be solely responsible for all wastewater
collection systems sized to service the developer's project and any surrounding
land also owned by the developer and/or other partnerships or corporations in
which the developer has an interest. An oversizing reimbursement may only be
allowed for the size as required by the city over the size reasonably required by
the project and any surrounding land also owned by the developer, and/or other
partnerships or corporations in which the developer has an interest.
The oversizing reimbursement shall be calculated and based upon twice
the difference of the reasonable cost of materials, as specified below, or the
sizing, as required by the city, of the sewer pipe for the wastewater collection
system over and above the cost of the same materials for such wastewater
collection system otherwise reasonably sized for the project and all the
surrounding land also owned by the developer and/or other partnerships or
corporations in which the developer has an interest. An engineer of the
developer shall supply a list of associated material costs and all oversizing
quantities required for the project to the city. These oversizing quantities must
be certified by the city engineer to be correct to his/her best belief and
knowledge.
(4) The oversizing reimbursement shall be determined by the city,
based on material costs prevailing at the time of the execution of the
development contract.
(5) An oversizing reimbursement shall not be paid to the developer
until the project or development is fully accepted by the city for ownership,
operation, and maintenance. A developer shall apply to the city through the city
engineer's office for all oversizing reimbursements within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the date the developer is notified by the city of the commencement
of one (1) year warranty period for the wastewater collection system oversized
pursuant to this chapter or otherwise be forever barred from applying for or
collecting from the city any such oversizing reimbursement.
18-68
(6) If sufficient funds are not available from the city sewer fund to
finance the cost for oversizing reimbursement, the payment of the
reimbursement will be postponed, interest free, until such time as appropriate
funds are available.
(7) If at any time in the future should a developer connect onto a sewer
line previously provided an oversizing allowance, the city shall be entitled to
recapture a portion of the oversizing allowance based on the percentage unused
hydraulic capacity of the oversized sewer main. The amount of recapture shall
be as determined by the procedures outlined in the fee schedule.
The recapture amount shall be provided to the City of Lakeland upon
execution of the development contract for that particular development. If no
development contract exists, the fees shall be paid prior to connecting up to the
sewer. (as added by Ord. #08-127, Dec. 2008)
18-705. Exemptions. (1) The following shall be exempted from this
chapter and over-sizing requirements and over-sizing reimbursement:
(a) Privately-owned and other governmental
entities/agency-owned, operated and maintained wastewater collection
systems connected to the city systems will be exempt from this chapter
and are not eligible for oversizing reimbursements as otherwise provided
by this chapter. Only wastewater collection mains to be accepted by the
city for public ownership and maintenance will be eligible for an
oversizing reimbursement. (as added by Ord. #08-127, Dec. 2008)
18-706. Appeals. (1) Any developer directly aggrieved by a decision of
the city with respect to the determination of the amount or methodology in
calculation of an over-sizing reimbursement may appeal their cause to the board
of appeals.
(2) An appeal notice which states the grounds and reasons for the
appeal shall be made in writing to the board of appeals within twenty (20) days
of the date the developer is notified of the amount and calculation of an
oversizing reimbursement. The board of appeals is to preside at and make a
record of such appeal. (as added by Ord. #08-127, Dec. 2008)
18-707. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or
phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision, and such holdings shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof of this chapter. (as added by Ord. #08-127, Dec.

1State law reference
Tennessee Code Annotated, title 9, chapter 21.
18-73
18-807. Stormwater user's fees established. There shall be imposed
on each and every developed property in the city, except exempt property, a
stormwater user's fee, which shall be set from time to time by ordinance and in
the manner and amount prescribed by this ordinance. (as added by
Ord. #08-117, May 2008)
18-808. Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU). (1) Establishment.
There is established for purposes of calculating the stormwater user's fee the
Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) equal to six thousand (6,000) square feet of
impervious area.
(2) Setting the ERU. The ERU shall be amended by the municipality's
governing body from time to time by ordinance.
(3) Source of ERU. The municipality's governing body shall have the
discretion to determine the source of the data from which the ERU is
established, taking into consideration the general acceptance and use of such
source on the part of other stormwater systems, and the reliability and general
accuracy of the source. The municipality's governing body shall have the
discretion to determine the impervious surface area of other developed property
through property tax assessor's rolls or site examination, mapping information,
aerial photographs, and other reliable information. (as added by Ord. #08-117,
May 2008)
18-809. Property classification for stormwater user's fee.
(1) Property classifications. For purposes of determining the
stormwater user's fee, all properties in the city are classified into one (1) of the
following classes:
(a) Single family residential property;
(b) Developed property;
(c) Undeveloped property;
(i) Disturbed (farm land);
(ii) Undisturbed (grass land);
(d) Exempt property.
(2) Single family residential property and fee. The municipality's
governing body finds that the intensity of development of most parcels of real
property in the municipality classified as single family residential is similar and
that it would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely
the square footage of the improvements (such as buildings, structures, and other
impervious areas) on each such parcel. Therefore, all single family residential
properties in the city shall be charged a flat stormwater management fee, equal
the base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements.
(3) Developed property and fee. The fee for developed property (i.e.,
non-single-family residential property) in the municipality shall be the base rate
multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious
area (square feet) of the property by one (1) ERU times a correction factor based
18-74
on the following onsite improvements. The improvements and the correction
factors are as follows:
(a) For developed properties that discharge into onsite dry
detention ponds that regulate discharges not to exceed the historical
flow-rate, the correction factor shall be 0.40.
(b) For developed properties that utilize other onsite structures
that meet the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
best management practices that reduce runoff volumes to within five
percent (5%) of the historical flow-rates and can demonstrate the
improvement of stormwater runoff quality by means of engineering
principles, the correction factor shall be 0.55.
(c) If no onsite improvements exist, the correction factor shall
be 1.0.
All stormwater runoff from the developed site shall be covered by the
improvements listed above in order to receive a correction factor for the entire
site. The minimum stormwater management fee for other developed property
shall equal the base rate for single family residential property.
(4) Undeveloped property. (a) Disturbed (farm land). Parcels which
are disturbed by farming activities which results in an annual cycle of
planting and harvest will be charged a stormwater fee of one (1) ERU
unless significant erosion is allowed to occur due to an increase in
stormwater runoff.
(b) Undisturbed parcels which are undisturbed and remain in
a natural state of vegetative growth (grass land) and are maintained to
prevent erosion by periodic moving or other appropriate means will not
be charged a stormwater fee. Undisturbed parcels that parcels not
maintained in appropriate conservation practices will be considered to be
disturbed and a stormwater user's fee shall be assessed in accordance
with procedures outlined herein this chapter.
(5) Exempt property. There shall be no stormwater user's fee for
exempt property. (as added by Ord. #08-117, May 2008)
18-810. Base rate. The municipality's governing body shall, by
ordinance, establish the base rate for the stormwater user's fee. The base rate
shall be calculated to insure adequate revenues to fund the costs of stormwater
management and to provide for the operation, maintenance, and capital
improvements of the stormwater system in the city. (as added by Ord. #08-117,
May 2008)
18-811. Adjustments to stormwater user's fees. The stormwater
program shall have the right on its own initiative to adjust upward or downward
the stormwater user's fees with respect to any property, based on the
approximate percentage on any significant variation in the volume or rate of
stormwater, or any significant variation in the quality of stormwater, emanating
18-75
from the property, compared to other similar properties. In making
determinations of the similarity of property, the stormwater program shall take
into consideration the location, geography, size, use, impervious area,
stormwater facilities on the property, and any other factors that have a bearing
on the variation. (as added by Ord. #08-117, May 2008)
18-812. Property owners to pay charges. The owner of each
non-exempt lot or parcel shall pay the stormwater user's fees and charges as
provided in this chapter. (as added by Ord. #08-117, May 2008)
18-813. Billing procedures and penalties for late payment.
(1) Rate and collection schedule. The stormwater user's fee will be set
at a rate, and collected on a schedule established by ordinance. The stormwater
fee shall reflect the nature of the property classification by the water meter
billing. The stormwater user fee for single-family residential and non-residential
developed property shall be billed and collected monthly. Apartment buildings
will be billed monthly to either a master meter (base rate times the number of
individual apartments) or to the individual meters for each apartment resident,
whichever the case may be. The owner of a mobile home park will receive a
monthly bill for the entire complex (base rate times the number of individual
mobile home sites). Undeveloped properties will be billed monthly at the rate
established by this ordinance if the property is utilized for farming activities and
allowed to erode and contribute to pollution of streams, rivers and ponds here
in Lakeland.
(2) Delinquent bills. The stormwater user's fee shall be billed through
Memphis Light, Gas, and Water and paid by mail or in person as per their
requirements; and shall become delinquent as of sixty (60) days following the
billing. Any unpaid stormwater user's fee shall bear interest at the legal rate if
it remains unpaid after one hundred twenty (120) days following the billing. (as
added by Ord. #08-117, May 2008)
18-814. Appeals of fees. (1) The City of Lakeland Board of Appeals
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
(2) Variances may be issued in regards to the stormwater user fees
and/or property classification. The stormwater management plan operating
budget shall not be appealed.
(3) In passing upon such variances, the board of appeals shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors such as practices that meet the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation best management
practices, historical flows versus developed flows, and all standards specified in
other sections of this chapter, and,
18-76
(4) Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of
this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
(5) Request for variances may be appealed within thirty (30) calendar
days from the date of the last bill containing stormwater user's fees charges.
(6) Variances may be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum relief necessary, considering the amount of the fee and/or the
property classification.
(7) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship compared to other similarly assessed
property; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(8) Written notice. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall
be given written notice by the board of appeals.
(9) Record keeping and reporting. The City of Lakeland shall maintain
the record of all appeal actions.
(10) All appeals shall be reviewed and a decision rendered within fortyfive
days (45) days after the appeal is filed. (as added by Ord. #08-117, May
2008)
18-815. Enforcement, abatement, penalties, and appeals.
(1) Enforcement and abatement authority. The city manager or his
designees shall have the authority to issue notices of violation and citations, and
to impose the civil penalties provided in this section.
(2) Notification of violation. (a) Written notice. Whenever the city
manager or his/her designee finds that any permittee or any other person
discharging stormwater has violated or is violating this chapter or a
permit or order issued hereunder, the city manager may serve upon such
person written notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of this notice,
an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be
submitted to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation.
(b) Consent orders. The city manager or his/her designee is
empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include
specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall
18-77

contribution and accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into said sewer system
from commercial, industrial and institutional food service establishments. The
objective is to reduce or eliminate sanitary sewer overflows onto streets,
waterways, and onto residential and commercial properties and buildings that
could result in liabilities to the city. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-902. Definitions. (1) "Black water" means wastewater containing
human waste from sanitary fixtures such as toilets and urinals.
(2) "Brown grease" means fats, oils, and grease that is discharged to
the grease control equipment.
(3) "City" shall mean the City of Lakeland or the city manager or
designee.
(4) "FOG (Fats, Oils, and Grease)" means organic polar compounds
derived from animal and/or plant sources. FOG may be referred to as grease
or greases in this chapter.
(5) "Food Service Establishment (FSE)" means any establishment,
business or facility engaged in preparing, serving or making food available for
consumption. Single family residences are not an FSE, however,
multi-residential facilities may be considered an FSE at the discretion of the
city. Food service establishments will be classified as follows:
18-81
(a) Class 1: Deli  engaged in the sale of cold cut and
microwaved sandwiches/subs with no frying or grilling on site, ice cream
shops and beverage bars as defined by North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) 77213, Mobile Food Vendors as defined by
NAICS 722330.

defined by NAICS 722310 but not to exclude self-run operations.
(6) "Gray water" refers to all other wastewater other than black water
as defined in this chapter.
(7) "Grease Control Equipment (GCE)" means a device for separating
and retaining wastewater FOG prior to wastewater exiting the FSE and
entering the citys sewer system. Devices include grease interceptors, grease
traps, or other devices approved by the city.
(8) "Grease interceptor" means grease control equipment identified as
a large tank, usually one thousand (1,000) gallon to three thousand (3,000)
gallon capacity, which provides FOG control for an FSE. Grease interceptors will
be located outside the FSE, unless a variance request has been granted.
(9) "Grease trap" means grease control equipment identified as an
under the sink trap, a small container with baffles, or a floor trap. For an FSE
approved to install a grease trap, the minimum size requirement is the
equivalent of a twenty (20) gallon per minute/forty (40) pound capacity trap. All
grease traps will have flow control restrictor and venting.
(10). "Grease recycle container" means a container used for the storage
of yellow grease.
(11) "Series (grease interceptors installed in series)" means grease
interceptor tanks are installed one after another in a row and are connected by
plumbing pipe.
(12) "User" means a customer operating a food service establishment
and discharging to the sanitary sewer system.
(13) "Yellow grease" means fats, oils and grease that have not been in
contact or contaminated from other sources (water, wastewater, solid waste,
etc.) and can be recycled. Yellow grease is normally stored in a grease recycle
container or bin for beneficial reuse. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-903. General requirements. (1) All new and existing Food Service
Establishments (FSEs) are required to have Grease Control Equipment (GCE)
18-82
installed, maintained and operating properly, in accordance with this FOG
chapter.
(2) All FSEs will be required to maintain records of cleaning and
maintenance of GCE. GCE maintenance records include, at a minimum, the
date of cleaning/maintenance, company or person conducting the
cleaning/maintenance, volume (in gallons) of grease wastewater removed and
final disposal location.
(3) GCE maintenance records will be available at the FSE premises so
they can be provided to the city and/or the health department. The FSE shall
maintain GCE maintenance records for two (2) years.
(4) No FSE will discharge oil and grease in concentrations that exceed
the citys numerical limit for oil and grease.
(5) Owners of commercial property will be held responsible for
wastewater discharges from a leaseholder on their property.
(6) Grease control equipment certification requirement. All
establishments with grease control equipment must have their grease
interceptor or grease trap inspected and certified every two (2) years by a city
certified grease waste hauler or plumber. If a grease interceptor or grease trap
passes the certification requirement, then no further action is required. If a
grease interceptor or grease trap fails the certification requirement, then a
corrective action response is required from the FSE owner to the city within
thirty (30) calendar days.
(7) FSEs shall dispose of yellow grease in an approved container or
recycle container, and the contents shall not be discharged to any sanitary sewer
line, stormwater grate, drain or conveyance. Yellow grease, or oils, poured or
discharged into the FSE sewer lines or citys sewer system is a violation of this
FOG chapter.
(8) It shall be a violation of this FOG chapter to push or flush the
non-water portion of GCE into the public sewer. (as added by Ord. #10-153,
Nov. 2010)
18-904. Approved grease waste haulers. To ensure proper disposal
of the FOG waste, all grease waste haulers must operate trucks that are marked
with a company name, phone number, waste hauler permit, number, city and
state of legible size and color. The tank must also be marked with the company
name and capacity of the tank in gallons. The hauler must provide proof upon
request of the city that it is certified to operate in any of the surrounding
communities in Shelby County. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-905. Grease control equipment requirements. (1) Any new FSE,
existing FSE, upgrading of an existing FSE, or change of ownership of existing
FSE will be required to install and maintain a grease interceptor.
(2) New construction of FSEs shall have separate sanitary (restroom)
and kitchen process lines. The kitchen process lines shall be plumbed to
18-83
appropriately sized GCE. No sanitary wastewater or stormwater shall be
plumbed to the GCE.
(3) All of the FSEs internal plumbing shall be constructed to separate
sanitary (restroom) flow from kitchen process flow. Sanitary flow and kitchen
process discharges shall be approved separately by the city and shall discharge
from the building separately. Kitchen process lines and sanitary lines may
combine prior to entering the public sewer; however, the lines cannot be
combined until after the GCE.
(4) A grease interceptor or grease trap will be installed and connected
so that it may be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of grease
at any time.
(5) Existing food service establishments are required to install GCE
and meet the FOG chapter requirements by January 1, 2013. Separate piping
as specified under § 18-806 is not required. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov.
2010)
18-906. New multi-unit (strip mall) facilities. (1) New strip malls
or strip centers must have two (2) separate sewer line connections at each unit
within the strip mall or strip center. One (1) sewer line will be for sanitary
wastewater and one (1) sewer line will be for the kitchen area, or potential
kitchen area, of each unit. The kitchen area, or potential kitchen area, sewer
line will be connected to floor drains in the specified kitchen area, and will
connect, or be able to connect, to other food service establishment kitchen
fixtures, such as a three (3) compartment sink, a two (2) compartment sink, a
pre-rinse sink, a mop sink and/or a hand wash sink.
(2) Owners of a new multi-unit facility or new "strip mall" facility shall
contact the city prior to conducting private plumbing work at the multi-unit
facility site. Multi-unit facility owners or their designated contractor shall have
plans for separate private wastewater lines for kitchen and sanitary wastewater
for each "individual" unit. In addition, the plans shall identify "stub-out"
locations to accommodate a minimum of one thousand (1,000) gallon grease
interceptor for each unit of the multi-unit facility.
(3) FSEs located in a new multi-unit facility shall have a minimum of
a one thousand (1,000) gallon grease interceptor installed, unless that FSE is
identified as a Class 1 facility. Sanitary wastewater, or black water, shall not
be connected to GCE. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-907. Variance to grease interceptor installation. At the
discretion of the city engineer, an FSE may receive a variance from the required
installation of a grease interceptor and sewer line piping. Variances will be
limited to existing FSEs that have unusual physical location circumstances that
will prevent the installation of a large grease interceptor or separate piping of
sewer waste. Sizing of grease interceptors will be based on the standard
18-84
PDI-G101 of the Plumbing and Drainage Institute, simplified chart, wherever
possible. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-908. Approval of grease control equipment. All existing FSEs
that have upgraded their plumbing facilities must contact the city for final
approval of the grease control equipment. This will include onsite inspection of
the grease control equipment by the city. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-909. Grease control equipment sizing. (1) Minimum acceptable
size of grease control equipment for each FSE classification will be as follows:
(a) Class 1: Deli, ice cream shops, beverage bars, mobile food
vendors  twenty (20) gpm/forty (40) pound grease trap (NAICS 72213,
72233).
(b) Class 2: Limited-service restaurants/cafeterias/
daycares  one thousand (1,000) gallon grease interceptor (NAICS
722211, 722320).
(c) Class 3: Full service restaurants  one thousand (1,000)
gallon grease interceptor (NAICS 722110).
(d) Class 4: Buffet and cafeteria facilities  one thousand five
hundred (1,500) gallon grease interceptor (NAICS 72212).
(e) Class 5: Institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.)  two
thousand (2,000) gallon grease interceptor (NAICS 722310).
(2) To calculate the appropriate size GCE, the FSEs engineer,
architect or contractor should use a formula that considers fixture units, storage
capacity, type of facility and an adequate retention time. The grease control
equipment minimum acceptable size for the above listed FSE classification
(Class 1 through 5) must be met.
(3) The city will review and approve of the GCE sizing received from
the FSEs engineer, architect or contractor. The city will make a decision to
approve or require additional grease interceptor volume based on the type of
FSE, the number of fixture units, and additional calculations. Grease
interceptor capacity should not exceed three thousand (3,000) gallons for each
interceptor tank. In the event that the grease interceptor calculated capacity
needs to exceed three thousand (3,000) gallons, the FSE shall install an
additional interceptor of the appropriate size. If additional interceptors are
required, they shall be installed in series.
(4) Grease interceptors that are installed in series shall be installed
in such a manner to ensure positive flow between the tanks at all times.
Therefore, tanks shall be installed so that the inlet invert of each successive
tank shall be a minimum of two inches (2") below the outlet invert of the
preceding tank.
(5) Grease control equipment must remove fats, oils, and grease at or
below the city limit of one hundred (100) mg/L. (as added by Ord. #10-153,
Nov. 2010)
18-85
18-910. Grease interceptor design and installation. (1) Access
openings (manholes). (a) Access to grease interceptors shall be provided
by a minimum of one (1) manhole per interceptor division (baffle
chamber) and of twenty-four inch (24") minimum dimensions terminating
one inch (1") above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. An
eight inch (8") thick concrete pad extending a minimum of twelve inches
(12") beyond the outside dimension of the manhole frame shall be
provided. One (1) manhole shall be located above the inlet tee hatch and
the other manhole shall be located above the outlet tee hatch. A minimum
of twenty-four inches (24") of clear opening above each manhole access
shall be maintained to facilitate maintenance, cleaning, pumping, and
inspections.
(b) Access openings shall be mechanically sealed and gas tight
to contain odors and bacteria and to exclude vermin and ground water in
a manner that permits regular reuses.
(c) The manholes are to be accessible for inspection by the city.
(2) Additional requirements. (a) Water tight. Precast concrete grease
interceptors shall be constructed to be watertight. A static water test
shall be conducted by the installer and timed so as to permit verification
through visual inspection by regulatory agent. The water test shall
consist of plugging the outlet (and the inlet if necessary) and filling the
tank(s) with water to the tank top a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours
before the inspection. The tank shall not lose water during this test
period. Certification by the plumbing contractor shall be supplied to the
city prior to final approval of grease control equipment.
(b) Location. Grease interceptors shall be located so as to be
readily accessible for cleaning, maintenance, and inspections. They
should be located close to the fixture(s) discharging the greasy waste
stream. If possible, grease interceptors should not be installed in
"drive-thru" lanes or a parking area. Grease interceptor access manholes
shall never be passed over.
(c) Responsibility. Removal of the grease from the wastewater
routed to a public or private sanitary system is the responsibility of the
user/owner.
(d) Construction material. Grease interceptors shall be
constructed of sound durable materials, not subject to excessive corrosion
or decay, and shall be water and gas tight. Each interceptor shall be
structurally designed to withstand any anticipated load to be placed on
the interceptor (i.e. vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas). Note:
Concrete materials and other grease interceptor materials shall meet the
American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and International
Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) standards.
(e) Marking and identification. Prefabricated gravity grease
interceptors shall be permanently and legibly marked with the following:
18-86
(i) Manufacturers name or trademark, or both;
(ii) Model number;
(iii) Capacity;
(iv) Month and year of manufacture;
(v) Load limits and maximum recommended depth of
earth cover in feet;
(vi) Inlet and outlet. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov.
2010)
18-911. Grease interceptor cleaning/maintenance requirements.
(1) Partial pump of interceptor contents or onsite pump and treatment
of interceptor contents will not be allowed due to reintroduction of fats, oils and
grease to the interceptor and pursuant to Lakeland Municipal Code chapter 4,
title 18, Sewer Use and Wastewater Treatment and as referenced in the Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 403.5 (b)(8), which states "Prohibited discharges.
No persons shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged or deposited into
the citys wastewater system any wastewater that contains the following: any
trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated and
approved by the city."
(2) Grease interceptors must be pumped-in-full (total pump of all
contents) when the total accumulations of surface FOG (including floating
solids) and settled solids reach twenty-five percent (25%) of the grease
interceptors overall liquid depth. This criterion is referred to as the "25 percent
rule." At no time shall the cleaning frequency exceed ninety (90) days unless
approved by the city. Approval will be granted on a case by case situation with
submittal by the FSE documenting proof of proposed frequency. Some existing
FSEs in Class 2 through 5 will need to consider a pumping schedule of thirty
(30) or sixty (60) days to meet this requirement.
(3) The grease interceptor effluent-T will be inspected during cleaning
and maintenance, and the condition noted by the grease waste haulers company
or individual conducting the maintenance. Effluent-Ts that are loose, defective,
or not attached must be repaired or replaced immediately. Any repairs to the
grease interceptor should be documented and kept on file at the FSE.
(4) Grease interceptors must have access manholes over the influent-T
and effluent-T for inspection and ease of cleaning/maintenance. Access manholes
will be provided for all separate compartments of interceptors for complete
cleaning (i.e. interceptor with two (2) main baffles or three (3) compartments
will have access manholes at each compartment).
(5) Grease interceptor waste must be hauled offsite and disposed at a
state or POTW approved disposal location. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov.
2010)
18-87
18-912. "Additives" prohibition for use as grease management and
control. (1) Additives include but are not limited to products that contain
solvents, emulsifiers, surfactants, caustics, acids, enzymes and bacteria.
(2) Use of biological additives is discouraged. Any additive placed into
the grease trap or building discharge designed to absorb, purge, consume, treat
or otherwise eliminate grease shall require written approval by the grease
management coordinator. If the city identifies FOG in the downstream sewer
system from an FSE that is using an additive, then the city may require the
FSE to discontinue use of the additive.
(3) Additive use will not be a substitute for regular, required cleaning
or pumping of grease control equipment.
(4) This FOG chapter prohibits the use of chemicals, acids, caustics,
enzymes, hot water, emulsifiers, surfactants, or other additives to cause oil or
grease to pass through the users grease trap or grease interceptor designed to
remove oil and grease. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-913. Right of entryinspection and monitoring. The city shall
have the right to enter the premises of FSEs to determine whether the FSE is
complying with the requirements of this FOG chapter. FSEs shall allow city
personnel or their authorized representative, upon presentation of proper
credentials, full access to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring, and/or records examination. Unreasonable delays in allowing city
personnel access to the FSE premises shall be a violation of this FOG chapter
and the city sewer use ordinance. All grease interceptors/traps shall be subject
to review, evaluation and inspection by the city personnel during normal
working hours. Inspections will determine proper maintenance, changes in
operation, proper records and files, ability of interceptor to trap and prevent
grease from entering the system and any other factors pertaining to grease
management. The city reserves the right to make determinations of
interceptor/trap condition and adequacy based on review of all information
regarding the interceptor/trap performance and may require cleaning,
maintenance, modification or replacement. All records will be available onsite
for review by the city for a period of thirty-six (36) months. The city may require
that the FSE install monitoring or additional pretreatment equipment deemed
necessary for compliance with this FOG chapter and or the city sewer use
ordinance. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-914. Fee option. The city may charge inspection, monitoring,
assessment, impact, surcharge and/or permit fees to food service establishments
for reimbursement of the cost to administer this FOG regulatory program. Any
associated fees will be listed in the Lakeland Fee Schedule. (as added by
Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)
18-88
18-915. Violations and enforcement action. (1) Violations of this
FOG regulatory program include, but are not limited to, failure to clean or pump
grease control equipment, failure to maintain grease control equipment
including installation of properly functioning effluent-T and baffles, failure to
install grease control equipment, failure to control FOG discharge from the FSE,
failure to certify the grease interceptor or trap, being responsible for sewer line
obstruction, being responsible for a sanitary sewer overflow, and using additives
so that FOG is diluted or pushed downstream of the FSE.
(2) Whenever the city determines that a grease interceptor or trap is
in need of installation, pumping, repairs, maintenance or replacement, a
noncompliance notification or a Notice of Violation (NOV) will be issued stating
the nature of the violation(s) and timeframe for corrective measures.
(3) If the facility fails to initiate action in response to a noncompliance
notification or NOV, a second notice will be issued and additional fees assessed.
Fees may include costs associated with service calls for sewer line blockages,
line cleaning, camera trucks, line and pump repairs, including all labor,
material and equipment. Further noncompliance will result in the
discontinuance of the facilitys water service.
(4) Immediate discontinuance of water may be requested by the city
to Memphis Light Gas and Water if the facility presents an imminent
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the public or to the
environment, or causes stoppages or excessive maintenance to the sanitary
sewer system, causes significant interference with the wastewater treatment
plant, or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Service
shall be reinstated when such conditions have been eliminated as determined
by the city.
(5) If inspections and field investigations determine that any fats, oils
and grease interference or blockage in the sewer system, a sewage pumping
station, or the wastewater treatment plant is caused by a particular food service
establishment, then that food service establishment shall reimburse the city for
all labor, equipment, supplies and disposal costs incurred by city to clean the
interference or blockage. The charges will be added to the FSEs
water/wastewater bill. Failure to reimburse the city may result in termination
of water service. (as added by Ord. #10-153, Nov. 2010)

subject to fire department approval and provided further that no public nuisance
is or will be created by the open burning.
(a) Fires used for the cooking of food or for ceremonial,
recreational or comfort-heating purposes including barbecues and outdoor
fireplaces. This exception does not include commercial food preparation
facilities and their operation.
(b) Fires set for the training and instruction of firemen or for
research in fire protection or prevention. However, routine demolition of
structures via supervised open burning by responsible fire control persons
will not be considered fire training. Additionally, the person responsible
for such burning, unless conducted at a recognized fire training academy,
must certify compliance with the following requirements by written
statement. The certification must be delivered to the Pollution Control
Section of the Memphis-Shelby County Health Department (department)
at least ten (10) working days prior to commencing the burn:
(i) The open burning is being conducted solely for fire
training purposes.

20-5
(3) Exceptions to paragraph (1) may be permitted for vegetation if all
of the following conditions are met when an air curtain destructor is used:
(a) A request is filed with the health officer giving the reason
why no method except open burning can be employed to dispose of the
material involved, the amount and kind of material to be burned, the
exact location where the burning will take place, and the dates when the
open burning will be done. All changes in type of, or increase in
quantities of, materials burned must be preceded by notification. The
notification must be delivered to the department at least ten (10) working
days prior to commencing the change in the burn.
(b) The person applying for the permit certifies, by written
statement, compliance with following distance requirements, at a
minimum:
(i) The open burning site must be at least five hundred
(500) feet from any federal and from any state highway; and
(ii) The open burning site must be at least one thousand
(1,000) feet from any school, national or state part, national
reservation, national or state forest, wildlife area, and/or residence
not on the same property as the air curtain destructor; and
(iii) The open burning site must be at least on-half (½)
mile from any airport, nursing home or hospital.
(c) The plume from the air curtain destructor must meet the
visible emission standards specified in section 20-1(105) [Reference

allow one start-up period in excess of the standard, per day, not to exceed
20 minutes in 24 hours.
(d) All material to be burned must be dry and in other respects
be in a state to sustain good combustion. Open burning must be
conducted when ambient conditions are such that good dispersion of
combustion products will result. Priming materials used to facilitate
such burning shall be limited to #1 or #2 grade fuel oils.
(e) No fire shall be ignited while any air pollution emergency
episode is in effect in the area of the burn. No fire shall be ignited during
any exceedance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone,
oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, or particulate matter. Permittee is
required to contact the department's Computerized Local Air Index
Reporting system (CLAIR) recorded line at (901) 544-7489 or 544-7490
before igniting a fire to determine if it is a burning day or a no-burning
day.
(f) Approval is received from the health officer in writing.
(g) Permission is secured from the fire department in the
jurisdiction involved.
(h) The burning will be done between the hours of 9:00 AM and
4:00 PM or as authorized by the health officer.
20-6
This approval will not relieve the person responsible for such burning
from the consequences of any damages, injuries, or claims resulting from such
burning.
(4) Definitions. (a) "Air curtain destructor" is a portable or
stationary combustion device that directs a plane of high velocity forced
draft air through a manifold head into a burn chamber with vertical walls
in such a manner as to maintain a curtain of air over the surface of the
burn chamber and a recirculating motion or air under the curtain. The
use of an air curtain destructor is considered controlled open burning.
(b) "Air pollution emergency episode" is defined as air pollution
alerts, warnings, or emergencies declared by the health officer during
adverse air dispersion conditions that may result in harm to public health
or welfare.
(c) "Natural disaster" is defined as any event commonly
referred to as an "Act of God" and includes but is not limited to the
following weather related or naturally occurring categories of events:
tornadoes, hail and wind storms, snow or ice storms, flooding and
earthquakes.
(d) "Open burning" is the burning of any matter under such
conditions that products of combustion are emitted directly into the open
atmosphere without passing directly through a stack.
(e) "Person" is any individual, partnership, co-partnership, firm,
company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate,
political subdivision, an agency, authority, commission, or department of
the United States government, or of the State of Tennessee government;
or any other legal entity, or its legal representative, agent, or assigns.
(5) Burning after natural disasters.
(a) Open burning of materials resulting from a natural disaster,
and when conducted in conformity with the following conditions, may be
permitted:
(i) Fires disposing of structural and household materials
and vegetation are allowed only when those structures or
materials are destroyed or severely damaged by natural disaster.
Input from emergency management personnel may be requested
in determining qualification with this criteria. The provisions of
this section pertaining to structural and household materials may
be waived if the persons seeking to open burn under this provision
make a reasonable effort to remove all expressly prohibited
material from the structural remains before ignition. The
department reserves the right to inspect the proposed materials to
be burned before ignition. The alternative use of chippers and
grinders, landfilling, or on-site burial of waste in lie of burning, if
lawful, is encouraged.
20-7
(ii) If a governmental collective burn site for disposing of
structural and household materials and vegetation damaged by a
natural disaster is planned, the person responsible for such
burning must notify the department of the proposed location. The
notification must be delivered to the department at least three (3)
days prior to commencing the burn. The department may request
that alternate sites be identified to minimize impact to air quality.
The alternative use of chippers and grinders in lieu of burning is
encouraged.
(iii) A traffic hazard shall not be caused by the air
contaminants generated by the fire.
(iv) No fire shall be ignited while any air pollution
emergency episode is in effect in the area of the burn. No fire shall
be ignited during any exceedance of the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard for ozone, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide,
or particulate matter. Contact the department's Computerized
Local Air Index Reporting system (CLAIR) recorded line at (901)
544-7489 or 544-7490 before igniting a fire to determine if it is a
burning day or a no-burning day.
(v) Open burning conducted under this exception is only
allowed where no other safe and/or practical means of disposal is
available.
(b) The health officer reserves the right to require a person to
cease or limit open burning if emissions from the fires are deemed by the
health officer or his designee to jeopardize public health or welfare, create
a public nuisance or safety hazard, create a potential safety hazard, or
interfere with the attainment or maintenance of the air quality
standards.
(c) Any exception to the open burning prohibition granted by
this section does not relieve any person of the responsibility to obtain a
permit required by any other agency, or of complying with other
applicable requirements, ordinances, or restrictions. [Particular attention
is directed to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 39-14-306, which prohibits
open air fires between October 15 and May 15 within five hundred (500)
feet of any forest, grasslands or woodlands without first securing a permit
from the state forester in unincorporated portions of Shelby County.]
(1989 Code, § 8-602, as replaced by Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-103. Severability of parts of articles. The provisions of this air
pollution control code are hereby declared to be severable, and if any sections,
provisions, clauses, or parts be held unconstitutional or void, then the remainder
of this air pollution control code shall continue in full force and effect, it being
the legislative intent that this air pollution control code would have been
20-8
adopted even if such unconstitutional or void matter had not been included
therein. (1989 Code, § 8-603, as replaced by Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-104. Enforcement  violations of chapter  notice; citation;
injunctive relief. (1) Whenever evidence has been obtained or received
establishing that a violation of this code has been committed, the health officer
shall issue a notice to correct the violation or a citation to cease the violation.
Such notice or citation shall briefly set forth the general nature of the violation
and specify a reasonable time within which the violation shall be rectified or
stopped. If the violation is not corrected within the time so specified, or the
violation stopped, or reasonable steps taken to rectify the violation, the health
officer shall have the power and authority to issue an order requiring the
violator to cease or suspend operation of the facility causing the violation until
the violation has been corrected, or initiate proceedings to prosecute the violator
for violation of this code.
(2) In the event any person fails to comply with a cease or suspend
operation order, that is not subject to a stay pending administrative or judicial
review, the health officer shall institute proceedings in a court of competent
jurisdiction for injunctive relief to enforce the regulations or orders pursuant
hereto. (as added by Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-105. Enforcement penalties  misdemeanor, civil, and
noncompliance. (1) Failure to comply with any of the provisions of the City
of Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code shall constitute a violation
thereof and shall subject the person or persons responsible therefore to any and
all of the penalties provided by law.
(2) The Memphis-Shelby County Health Department in conjunction
with the local air pollution control board shall have authority, at their option,
to institute and litigate proceedings for violations as set out therein. Any person
who knowingly:
(a) Violates or fails to comply with any provision of the City of
Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code, any board or
administrative order or any permit condition;
(b) Makes any false material statement, representation, or
certification in any record, report, plan or other document required by
permit to be either filed or maintained;
(c) Falsifies, tampers with, renders inaccurate or fails to install
any monitoring device or method required to be maintained or followed;
or
(d) Fails to pay a fee commits a Class C misdemeanor pursuant
to the Tennessee Code Annotated with the fine not to exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) per day per violation. For the purpose of this
section, each day of continued violation constitutes a separate offense and
is punishable as such.
20-9
No warrant, presentment or indictment arising under subsection 20-105(2) shall
be issued except upon application, authorized in writing, by the health officer
on behalf of the local air pollution control program operating under a certificate
of exemption pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-201-115, for a violation within its jurisdiction.
(3) Willful and knowing violation of any provision of the City of
Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code is declared to be a
misdemeanor, and each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.
Conviction of a misdemeanor is punishable with the fine not to exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) per day per violation or with imprisonment not
greater than thirty (30) days, or both.
(4) In addition and supplemental to any criminal action which may be
prosecuted under this section, the health officer has and is vested with
jurisdiction and authority to determine whether or not any provision of the City
of Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code, any permit condition, or
any order has been violated, and whether or not such violation constitutes a
public nuisance. Upon such finding that a public nuisance exists, the health
officer has authority to abate any such public nuisance in the manner provided
by the general law relating to the abatement of public nuisances.
(5) Orders and assessments of damages and civil penalties and
appeals.
(a) When the health officer discovers that any provision of the
City of Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code has been
violated, the health officer may issue an order for correction to the
responsible person, and this order shall be complied with within the time
limit specified in the order. Such order shall be served by personal
service or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. The recipient
of such an order may appeal in the same manner as with an assessment
of damages or civil penalty under paragraph (b).
(b) (i) In addition to the criminal penalties in this section,
any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of the City
of Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code or any standard
adopted pursuant thereto in a permit, shall be subject to a civil penalty
of up to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) per day for each day of
violation. Any person against whom an assessment in excess of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation has been issued by a local
pollution control program pursuant to this section may petition the
technical secretary for de novo review of the assessment under the
provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-201-116. The technical
secretary shall render an initial determination, and that initial
determination may be appealed to the Tennessee Air Pollution Control
Board pursuant to this section. Each day such violation continues
constitutes a separate punishable offense, and such person shall also be
liable for any damages to the municipality resulting therefrom.
20-10
(ii) Any civil penalty or damages shall be assessed in the
following manner:
(A) The health officer on behalf of the Memphis-
Shelby County Health Department operating under a
certificate of exemption pursuant to Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 68-201-115 may issue an assessment against
any person responsible for the violation or damages. Such
person shall receive notice of such assessment by certified
mail, return receipt requested;
(B) Any person against whom an assessment has
been issued may appeal the assessment by filing a petition
for review with the health officer, or with the technical
secretary of an assessment in excess of $10,000 for each
violation, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
assessment, setting forth the grounds and reasons for such
person's objections and requesting a hearing on the matter;
and
(C) If a petition for review of the assessment is not
filed within thirty (30) days after the date the assessment
is served, the violator shall be deemed to have consented to
the assessment and it shall become final.
(iii) In assessing such civil penalty, the factors specified
in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-201-106 and title 42 U.S.C.
§ 7413 and § 7420 may be considered. Damages to the state or to
the City of Lakeland may include any expenses incurred in
investigating the enforcing of this section; in removing, correcting,
or terminating the effects of air pollution; and also compensation
for any expense, loss or destruction of plant or animal life or any
other actual damages or clean-up expenses caused by the pollution
or by the violation. The plea of financial inability to prevent, abate
or control pollution by the polluter or violator shall not be a valid
defense to liability for violations of the provisions of the City of
Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code.
(iv) The issuance of an order or assessment of civil
penalty by the Memphis-Shelby County Health Department
operating under a certificate of exemption as provided for in this
section is intended to provide additional and cumulative remedies
to prevent, abate and control air pollution in Tennessee. Nothing
herein shall be construed to preempt, supersede, abridge or
otherwise alter any rights, action or remedies of the technical
secretary, Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board or Commissioner
of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.
(v) (A) Whenever any order or assessment under this
section has become final, a notarized copy of the order or
20-11
assessment may be filed in the office of the clerk of the
chancery court of Shelby County if the final order or
assessment is from the Memphis-Shelby County Health
Department.
(B) When filed in accordance with clause (v)(A), a
final order or assessment shall be considered as a judgment
by consent of the parties on the same terms and conditions
as those recited therein. Such judgment shall be promptly
entered by the court. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, the procedure for entry of the judgment and the
effect thereof shall be the same as provided in title 26,
chapter 6, Tennessee Code Annotated.
(C) Within forty-five (45) days after entry of a
judgment under clause (v)(B), any citizen of the City of
Lakeland shall have the right to intervene on the ground
that the penalties or remedies provided are inadequate or
are based on erroneous findings of facts. Upon receipt of a
timely motion to intervene, the court shall determine
whether it is duplicitous or frivolous, and shall notify the
movant and the parties of its determination. If the motion
is determined not to be duplicitous or frivolous, all parties
shall be considered to have sought review of the final order
or assessment, and the court shall proceed in accordance
with Tennessee Code Annotated, § 4-5-322. If no timely
motion to intervene is filed, or if any such motion is
determined to be duplicitous or frivolous, the judgment shall
become final forty-five (45) days after the date of entry.
(D) A final judgment under this subparagraph has
the same effect, is subject to the same procedures, and may
be enforced or satisfied in the same manner, as any other
judgment of a court of record of this state. (as added by
Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-106. Enforcement  variances. (1) Any person who owns or is in
control of any plant, building, structure, establishment, process or equipment
including a group of persons who own or control like processes or like equipment
may apply to the air pollution control hearing board, hereinafter referred to as
"the board", for a variance from rules or regulations governing the quality,
nature, duration or extent of discharge of air contaminants. The application for
a variance shall include information and data sufficient for the board to make
the findings required below. The hearing held hereunder shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of evidence as set forth in subsection 20-108(6) of the
City of Lakeland, Tennessee  Air Pollution Control Code. The board may grant
such variance, but only after public hearing on due notice and subject to the
20-12
certificate of exemption issued pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-
201-115 if it finds that:
(a) The emissions proposed to occur as a result of a variance
would not endanger or tend to endanger human health, safety, or welfare,
and would not cause or tend to cause property damage; and
(b) Compliance with the rules or regulations from which
variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or
greater benefits to the public or a variance is needed only until a rule
adopted by the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board becomes state
effective. If economic hardship is claimed, a description of expected
monetary losses shall be included.
(2) No variance shall be granted or denied pursuant to this section
until the board has considered the relative interests of the applicant, other
owners of property likely to be affected by the discharges, and others who may
be affected by granting or denying a request for variance.
(3) Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the
requirements of subsection (1) for time periods and under conditions consistent
with the reasons therefore, and with the following limitations:
(a) If the variance is granted on the grounds that there is no
practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention,
abatement, or control of the air pollution involved, the variance shall be
permitted only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement, or
control become known and available, and the variance shall be subject to
the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the board may
prescribe.
(b) If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance
with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is
sought will necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their
extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall
be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in view of the board,
is requisite for the taking of necessary measures. A variance granted on
the ground specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of
action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence
to such timetable and submittal of proof that such timetable is being met.
(c) Any variance or renewal granted shall be for a time period
not to exceed one (1) year.
(4) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed by
the air pollution control hearing board on terms and conditions and for periods
which would be appropriate on initial granting of the variance following the
same procedures required for issuance of the initial variance. If complaint is
made to the board on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be
granted, unless, following public hearing on the complaint, the board finds that
renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application
therefore. Any such application shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to
20-13
the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon a receipt of an application for
renewal, the board shall give public notice of such application in accordance with
rules and regulations of the board.
(5) A variance or renewal shall not be a right of the applicant or holder
thereof, but shall be in the discretion of the board. However, any applicant
adversely affected by the denial or the terms and conditions of the granting of
an application for a variance or renewal of a variance by the board may obtain
judicial review thereof only in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(6) Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted
pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the
emergency provisions and procedures of Sections 20-107 and 20-1(115)
[Reference 1200-3-15] to any person or his property. (as added by Ord. #03-39,
June 2003)
20-107. Enforcement  emergency powers of health officer.
(1) Any other provisions of the law notwithstanding, if the health
officer finds that a generalized condition of air pollution exists and that it
creates an emergency requiring immediate action to protect human health or
safety, the health officer shall order persons causing or contributing to the air
pollution to reduce or discontinue immediately the emission of air contaminants.

percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the most
recent calendar year preceding the unadjusted year exceeds the
Consumer Price Index for the calendar year two years prior to the
unadjusted year, unless the Shelby County Commission adopts an
emissions fee rate that excludes a Consumer Price Index adjustment.
This rate amount shall then reflect a one-year Consumer Price Index
adjustment. For purposes of this chapter and air pollution control code,
the Consumer Price Index is the average of the Consumer Price Index for
all urban consumers published by the Department of Labor, as of the
close of the twelve month period ending on August 31 of each calendar
year, and the revision of the Consumer Price Index which is most
consistent with the Consumer Price Index for 1989 shall be used.
(c) The fee collected shall be adjusted by resolution of the Board
of Shelby County Commissioners and the Lakeland Board of Mayor and
Aldermen from time to time consistent with the need to cover the costs
authorized by the air pollution control code and in accordance with the
procedures in Section 20-1(20). For purposes of this air pollution control
code a "stationary air pollution source" shall be that group of air pollution
sources located within a contiguous area and under common control.
(2) Maximum amount subject to emissions fee. Each stationary air
pollution source shall be assessed the emissions fee on no more than four
thousand (4,000) tons per year of each regulated pollutant it emits.

department shall collect an annual emissions fee from those entities within the
City of Lakeland which operate stationary air pollutant sources required to
make application on or after July 1, 1992, to the Memphis-Shelby County
Health Department for issuance, re-issuance or modification of a permit in
accordance with the City of Lakeland, Tennessee--Air Pollution Control Code,
and shall be subject to the fee schedule set out in § 20-112. This fee shall be
used for:
(1) Reviewing and acting upon any application for a permit or permit
modification under the City of Lakeland, Tennessee--Air Pollution Control Code
as amended;

source operating permit program allowable under the Federal Clean Air Act and
under regulations in support of those federal provisions as adopted locally in the
20-22
City of Lakeland, Tennessee--Air Pollution Control Code. The owner or operator
of any stationary source shall also pay any cost of expense associated with public
notices or notifications required pursuant to the City of Lakeland, Tennessee--
Air Pollution Control Code or the Federal Clean Air Act. (as added by Ord.
#03-39, June 2003)
20-116. Permits and fees -- reporting requirements. (1) Except as
provided below, each permitted stationary air pollution source must submit to
the department an annual report that establishes the amount of actual
emissions of each regulated pollutant, including carbon monoxide, for that
source. This report will be for the emissions of that source that occurred during
the calendar year starting in 1991 and continuing for succeeding years
thereafter. The department may request, and the air pollution source shall
provide, additional information on the emissions data submitted when the
department determines, the data previously provided is inadequate to establish
the actual type or amount of emissions from the source subject to fees.
(2) Not including air toxics as they are defined in the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 and the amendments thereto, if the source emits fewer
than twenty five (25) tons of actual emissions of pollutant during a year, it may
at its option, use as the actual emissions figure, its permitted pollutant levels
where available and known. If the source is a "major source" under the air
toxics provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 it too must calculate
its actual emission of regulated pollutants. Failure to provide, on a timely basis,
any additional information requested shall be considered failure to pay the fees.
(as added by Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-117. Permits and fees  small business waiver. The director of
the department, in his discretion but consistent with section 507(f) of the Clean
Air Acts Amendments of 1990, may, upon written petition setting forth in detail
the justification therefore, reduce or waive for up to three (3) years, any
emissions fee required under this chapter to take into account the financial
resources of small business stationary air pollution sources as defined under the
federal act or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. A decision to deny the
waiver may be appealed to the local air pollution control board by the party
requesting the waiver and will be heard under the same procedures as any other
decision that is appealed to this board. If a waiver is granted, it will be reviewed
by the board in its annual review process and is then subject to revocation or
modification by the board if found to be unwarranted or granted in an arbitrary
fashion. Such action will have no effect on prior years emissions fees and will
only apply to the collection of future emissions fees. (as added by Ord. #03-39,
June 2003)
20-118. Permits and fees  surplus funds carry forward. Any
surplus in emissions fee funds shall be carried forward from year to year for
20-23
these stated purposes only. If, however, in any year after 1993, this carry
forward surplus exceeds on February 15th thirty five percent (35%) of the
previous twelve (12) months fee, a ten percent (10%) per ton credit on the
established emissions fee amount shall be given to all stationary sources in the
next emissions fee payment. (as added by Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-119. Permits and fees  penalty provisions. Failure to pay the
fees set forth in this air pollution control code shall be a violation of the City of
Lakeland, Tennessee--Air Pollution Control Code and can result in the
assessment of penalties and injunction against the stationary air pollution
source. In addition to any fees owed, a maximum penalty equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the fees owed may be assessed for late payment. Interest in the amount
equal to the maximum allowed under state law shall also be charged for all fees
paid more than thirty (30) days late. When an emissions fee amount is
contested, only the contested portion can be withheld. Any uncontested fee
amount must be paid by the due date for payment. Due process for contested
amounts is provided by appeal under the administrative and judicial review
provisions of the City of Lakeland, Tennessee--Air Pollution Control Code for
appeal of decisions of the health officer. (as added by Ord. #03-39, June 2003)
20-120. Permits and fees  annual review of fee structure and
financial need. The Memphis-Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board shall
annually review the fee structure established for the local air pollution control
program and recommend to the Shelby County Commission any change in rate
or make-up of the fee it determines, after public hearing, is necessary to meet
the financial requirements of the Memphis-Shelby County Health Department
Air Pollution Control Program to fulfill the activities allowed to be funded by
these fees. Such review shall include an estimate of other funds available to the
program including surplus or carry forward funds as well as changes in state or
federal laws that could effect the program. The recommendation shall be
provided to the commission no later than April 1 of each year. The county
commission shall not, however, be required to adopt this recommendation, nor
to change fees on any predetermined schedule. If the Shelby County Commission
adopts a change in the rate or makeup of the fee, that adoption shall be provided
to the Lakeland Board of Mayor and Aldermen for adoption prior to collection
of changed emission fees by the Memphis-Shelby County Health Department.

LOCAL EMERGENCY POWER ORDINANCE
SECTION
20-301. Local emergency power.
20-301. Local emergency power. (1) It is the intent of the Local
Emergency Power Ordinance to designate Lakeland officials who can declare a
local emergency in the event of a natural or man made emergency/disaster, or
the imminent threat thereof, and to authorize certain actions relating thereto
until a meeting of the board of commissioners can be held.
(2) Pursuant to the code of ordinances, the local emergency powers
ordinance waives procedures all and formalities otherwise required for the
declaration of an emergency/disaster by the city manager or designee. In the
event that it is deemed necessary to declare the existence of an
emergency/disaster without delay, the director of the Memphis/Shelby County
EMA may, if the city manager or designee are not available, carry out said
declaration. The director is empowered to declare a local emergency whenever
he determines that a natural or manmade emergency/disaster has occurred or
that the occurrence or threat of one is imminent and requires immediate
expeditious action.
(3) "Emergency" will mean the occurrence, threat thereof, whether
accidental, natural, or caused by man, in war or peace, which results or may
result in substantial injury or harm to the population or substantial damage to
or loss of property.
(4) A local emergency/disaster will be declared by proclamation of the
city manager of Lakeland or designee. The declaration of the local emergency
shall continue until the city manager of Lakeland or designee, or the director of
the Memphis/Shelby County EMA designee in his absence finds that the threat
or danger no longer exists or until an emergency meeting of the Lakeland Board
of Commissioners take place and terminates or amends the declaration of the
local emergency/disaster by resolution or other action.
(5) A proclamation declaring a local emergency/disaster will activate
the emergency/disaster plans applicable to the specific incident and will be the

or facilities assembled or arranged to be made available pursuant to such plans.
(6) Upon the declaration of a local emergency/disaster, pursuant to this
ordinance, emergency ordinances issued by the officials of this jurisdiction will

following:
20-31
(i) Suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or
transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives and
combustibles.
(ii) Establish curfews, including, but not limited to, the

essential services, such as fire, police, emergency medical services
and hospital services, including the transportation of patients,
emergency utility repairs and emergency calls by physicians.
(iii) Utilize all available resources of the City of Lakeland

City of Lakeland, Memphis Light Gas and Water, emergency
workers, or any city for any purpose other that cooking, drinking,
or bathing.
(viii) Declare that during an emergency/disaster it shall be
unlawful and an offense against the City of Lakeland, for any
person, firm or corporation operating within the City of Lakeland
to charge more than the average retail price for any merchandise,
goods, or services sold during the emergency/disaster. The average
retail price as used herein is defined to be that price at which
similar merchandise, goods or services were being sold during the
ninety (90) days immediately preceding the emergency/disaster or
a mark-up which is not a larger percentage over wholesale cost
that was being added to wholesale cost before the
emergency/disaster.
(ix) Confiscate merchandise, equipment, vehicles or
property needed to alleviate the emergency/disaster.
Reimbursement shall be within sixty (60) days and customary
value charged for the item during ninety (90) days prior to the
emergency/disaster.
(x) Allow the city manager of Lakeland or designee in the
city manager's absence, the director of the Memphis/Shelby County
EMA, or designee on behalf of the City of Lakeland to request the
20-32
National Guard of the Army, Coast Guard or other law
enforcement divisions as necessary to assist in the mitigation of
the emergency/disaster or to help maintain law and order, rescue,
and traffic control.
(7) Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to limit the authority
of the Lakeland Board of Commissioners to declare or terminate a local
emergency/disaster and take any action authorized by law when in regular or
special session.
(8) Any person, firm or corporation who refuses to comply with or
violates any section of this ordinance, or the emergency measures which may be
made effective pursuant to this ordinance, shall be punished by a fine and/or
imprisonment as provided by law.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Lakeland from taking
such other lawful action in any court of competent jurisdiction as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any refusal to comply with or violation of this ordinance
or the emergency/disaster measures which may be effective pursuant to this
ordinance. Such other lawful action shall include, but shall not be limited to, an
equitable action for injunctive relief or any action of law for damages. (as added
by Ord. #11-162, Sept. 2011)
20-33
CHAPTER 4
MISCELLANEOUS
SECTION
20-401. Public records.
20-401. Public records. Procedures regarding access to an inspection
of public records:
(1) Consistent with the Public Records Act of the State of Tennessee,
personnel of the City of Lakeland shall provide full access and assistance in a
timely and efficient manner to Tennessee residents who request access to public
documents.
(2) Employees of the City of Lakeland shall protect the integrity and
organization of public records with respect to the manner in which the records
are inspected and copied. All inspections of records must be performed under the
supervision of the records custodian or designee. All copying of public records
must be performed by employees of the city, or, in the event that city personnel
are unable to copy the records, by an entity or person designated by the records
custodian.
(3) To prevent excessive disruptions of the work, essential functions,
and duties of employees of the City of Lakeland, persons requesting inspection
and/or copying of public records shall complete a records request form to be
furnished by the city. If the requesting party refuses to complete a request form,
a city employee shall complete the form with the information provided by the
requesting party. Persons requesting access to open public records shall describe
the records with specificity so that the records may be located and made
available for public inspection or duplication, as provided in (2) above. All
requests for public records shall be directed to the records custodian.
(4) When records are requested for inspection or copying, the records
custodian has seven (7) days to determine whether the city can retrieve the
records requested and whether the requested records contain any confidential
information, and the estimated charge for copying based upon the number of
copies and amount of time required.
Within seven (7) days of a request for records the records custodian shall:
(a) Produce the records requested;
(b) Deny the records in writing, giving explanation for denial;
or,
(c) In the case of voluminous requests, provide the requestor,
in writing, with an estimated time frame for production and an
estimation of duplication costs.
(5) There is no charge assessed to a requester for inspecting a public
record. Charges for physical copies of records, in accordance with the Office of
Open Records Counsel (OORC) schedule of reasonable charges, are as follows:
(a) $0.15 per copy for black and white copies.
20-34
(b) $0.50 per copy for colored copies.
(c) $0.15 per copy for accident reports.
(d) Maps, plats, electronic data, audio discs, video discs, and all
other materials shall be duplicated at actual costs to the city.
(6) Requests requiring less than one (1) hour of municipal employee
labor for research, retrieval and duplication are free to the requester. Labor in
excess of one (1) hour may be charged by the city, in addition to the cost per
copy, as provided in (5). The city may require payment in advance of producing
voluminous records. Requests for copies of records may not be broken down to
multiple requests for the same information in order to qualify for the first free
hour. For a request requiring more than one (1) employee to complete, labor
charges will be assessed based on the following formula:
In calculating the charge for labor, a department head shall
determine the number of hours each employee spent producing a request.
The department head shall then subtract the one (1) hour threshold from
the number of hours the highest paid employee(s) spent producing the
request. The department head will then multiply the total number of
hours to be charged for the labor of each employee by that employee's
hourly wage. Finally, the department head will add together the totals for
all the employees involved in the request and that will be the total
amount of labor that can be charged.
(7) The police chief shall maintain in his or her office records of
undercover investigators containing personally identifying information. All
other personnel records of the police department shall be maintained in the
office of the records custodian. Requests for personnel records, other than for
undercover investigators, shall be made to the records custodian, who shall
promptly notify the police chief of such request. The police chief shall make the
final determination as to the release of the information requested. In the event
that the police chief refuses to release the information, he shall provide a
written explanation of the reasons for not releasing the information.
(8) If the public records requested are frail due to age or other
conditions and copying of the records will cause damage to the original records,
the requesting party may be required to make an appointment for inspection.

B. Nonconforming Structures.
1. Intent. A nonconforming structure is a Principal
or Accessory Structure that was legally constructed
prior to the adoption of these Land Development
Regulations or amendment to these regulations, but
that could not occur under the provision of these
regulations. Applicable regulations include, but
are not limited to, such items as Build-to Zones,
Setbacks, Building Coverage, Building Height,
Building Transparency, entrances, Cap and Base
Type, and Building Materials.
2. Continuation of a Nonconforming Structure. A
nonconforming structure may continue to exist
subject to the following provisions:
a. An existing structure is considered conforming
if the size of the Nonconformance is fifteen
(15) percent or less of these Land Development
Regulationss requirement. For example, if the
required Setback is ten (10) feet and the buildings
Setback is eleven and a half (11.5) feet, the Setback
is considered in conformance.
b. An existing single family dwelling with a
nonconforming Side Yard Setback that is thirty
(30) percent or less of these Land Development
Regulations Side Yard Setback requirement may
be enlarged or extended along that Side Yard
provided that the following conditions are met:
(1) The enlargement or extension does not
increase the structures Nonconformance and,
(2) the enlargement or extension does not encroach
into the front Build-to Zone or Setback beyond
the original structure and,
(3) the enlargement or extension does not exceed
fifty (50) percent of the lineal footage of the
original dimensions of the structure.
c. Where an alteration includes an addition of more
than fifty (50) percent in building square footage,

approval.
e. The right to utilize a nonconforming structure shall
be terminated, if the structure is damaged by any
cause and the cost of such damages is fifty (50)
percent or more of the structures cost to rebuild at
the time of the event.
f. If the cost of damages to a nonconforming structure
are less than fifty (50) percent of the structures cost
to rebuild prior to the event, it may be repaired
provided that the repairs or reconstruction do not
increase the Nonconformance.
(1) Repairs or reconstruction of a nonconforming
structure shall be completed or substantially
completed within twelve (12) months of the
damage.
(2) If the Applicant demonstrates a good
faith effort proceeding toward repair or
reconstruction, such as a permit or cost
proposal from a contractor, this twelve (12)
month period may be extended up to an
61
I. Administration
Section 8 - Nonconformance
additional twenty-four (24) months with
permission of the BOA. Self imposed situations
shall not constitute cause for the delay.
g. The right to utilize a nonconforming structure
shall be terminated, if the structure is not used
or is abandoned for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months.
(1) If the Owner is actively seeking another tenant
for the Use of land or building, the BOA may
extend the time period for up to another twelve
(12) months.
(2) To obtain the extension, the Owner shall
provide evidence of this activity, including
solicitation and showing the site to potential
tenants and maintenance of utilities and other
site facilities for reuse; simply listing the site as
available real estate is not sufficient.

nonconforming Use may continue to exist subject to
the following provisions.
a. The nonconforming Use shall not be enlarged
or be extended to any other building, part of the
building, Lot or part of a Lot.
b. The right to continue a nonconforming Use shall
be terminated, if the structure housing the Use
is destroyed by any cause and the cost of such
damages is fifty (50) percent or more of the
structures cost to rebuild at the time of the event.
c. If the cost of the damages is less than fifty (50)
percent of the structures cost to rebuild at the
time of the event, it may be repaired provided that
the repairs or reconstruction do not increase the
Nonconformance.
(1) Repairs or reconstruction of a structure housing
a nonconforming Use shall be completed or
substantially completed within twelve (12)
months of the damage.
(2) This twelve (12) month period may be extended
up to an additional twenty-four (24) months
with permission of the BOA.

(12) months.
(2) To obtain the extension, the Owner shall
provide evidence of this activity, including
solicitation and showing the site to potential
tenants and maintenance of utilities and other
site facilities for reuse; simply listing the site as
available real estate is not sufficient.
3. Exception to Nonconforming Uses. All
nonconforming industrial, commercial, or business
Uses are subject to the provisions of the Tennessee
Nonconforming Property Act (T.C.A. §13-7-208)
and shall be permitted to do the following.
a. Continue in operation so long as the Use

1. Intent. Any site element or characteristic of a
Zoning Lot, such as impervious coverage, driveway
quantity, parking, landscaping, or other nonstructural
characteristic of a Lot that is not in
compliance with the provisions of these Land
Development Regulations, whether associated with
a nonconforming or conforming structure or Use,
lawfully in existence prior to the adoption of this
code, shall be considered a nonconforming site
characteristic.
2. Continuation of a Nonconforming Site
Characteristic. A nonconforming site characteristic
may continue to exist subject to the following
provisions:
a. An existing site characteristic is considered
conforming if the size of the Nonconformance
is fifteen (15) percent or less of these Land
Development Regulations requirement. For
example, if the required parking is thirty (30) spaces
and the number of spaces provided is twenty six
(26), the parking is considered in conformance.
b. The right to continue a nonconforming site
characteristic shall be terminated, if the associated
structure is altered to increase the associated
62
I. Administration
Section 8 - Nonconformance
structures footprint by more than twenty-five (25)
percent.
c. The right to continue a nonconforming site
characteristic shall be terminated, if the associated
Use or structure, conforming or not, is abandoned
for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.

through D may be granted, if:
1. The purpose of the discussed alteration is to convert
a nonconforming Use of a nonconforming structure
to a conforming Use in a nonconforming structure.
2. The proposed increase in the Nonconformance of
a structure is the minimum necessary to allow the
conversion of a nonconforming Use to a conforming
Use within a nonconforming structure.
3. The proposed alteration is to decrease the
nonconformity of the Use or structure.
F. Nonconforming Lot.
1. Intent. A nonconforming Lot is a Lot that was
legally recorded prior to the adoption of these Land
Development Regulations, but could not be created
under the provisions of these regulations. Applicable
regulations include Lot width and Lot size.
2. Continuation of a Nonconforming Lot. A
nonconforming Lot may be developed at or after
the time at which the Lot became nonconforming,
provided that it meets all of the following provisions.

a. Neighborhood Scale Open Space Requirements.
Refer to the specific requirements of each
Neighborhood Type for required quantities and
distribution (II.2 through II.7) and permitted open
space districts (III.1.D).
(1) Streamside Management Buffers, Conservation
Areas and Scenic Corridor Buffers shall be not
utilized to meet these requirements.
(2) Parcels less than Fourteen (14) acres. Parcels less
than fourteen (14) acres with Conservation Area
A or B totaling greater than ten (10) percent of
the Parcel, have no Neighborhood Scale Open
Space Requirements.
(3) Mix of Types. A mixture of Open Space Types
shall be used to meet the Neighborhood Scale
Open Space Requirements. When more than
three (3) Neighborhood Scale Open Spaces are
required, no Type shall be used more than twice.
b. City-Wide Parks Requirement. Refer to the current
Recreation Master Plan (part of the Comprehensive
Plan) for city-wide parks requirements.
(1) Each development that includes residential
Zoning Districts shall utilize the following:
(a) Parkland dedication formula. Each residential
subdivision shall utilize the formula in Article
IV.3 (Appendix) for a parkland dedication
requirement to determine whether a
dedication of park land or payment-in-lieu of
park land is required.
(b) Small Park Land Result. In no case shall land
be accepted which results in a dedicated
park that comprises less than 5 acres. If
calculations are for a land amount less than
this size, payment-in-lieu is required for the
Land Development Regulations 71

entire amount, unless adjacent lands can be
considered below.
(c) Public Parks. If a Subdivision is located
in the immediate vicinity of a proposed
neighborhood or community park, as
defined and located in the Recreation Master
Plan component of the Comprehensive Plan,
where such park(s) in the vicinity have not
already been located and approved, the
Applicant shall coordinate with the City to
locate such park(s) within the Subdivision, if
the parkland calculation noted above yields
a suitable amount of land, so long as the
MPC (with PRB review and recommendation)
determines that location in the subdivision is
appropriate for such public park(s). Adjoining
land already dedicated for recreation
can be considered toward meeting the
size requirements for such public park(s).
Lands for dedication shall be indicated in
applicable plat and construction documents
for dedication.
(d) Fee in lieu. If MPC (with PRB review and
recommendation) determines that land
in the subdivision is inappropriate or not
needed for a public park, the Applicant shall
provide a fee in-lieu-of parkland as indicated
in IV.3.
(e) Combination of Park Land and Fee in-Lieu.
If such park lands are recommended, but
the land calculation substantially exceeds
applicable recommended sizes for
neighborhood and community parks, the
Applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu-of park
land for the portion that exceeds what can
be appropriately located in the subdivision,
and what is appropriate for sizing such parks.
(2) For parkland dedication or payment in lieu,
a recommendation from the PRB shall be
required prior to consideration by the MPC. The
recommendation shall be based on suitability.
Suitability for parkland should be based on,
but is not limited to, such factors as size, shape,
development potential, topography, subsoils,
bodies of water, accessibility, location, utility,
compatibility with the Recreation Master Park
Plan and Comprehensive Plan, and neighboring
land uses, and nearby improvements.
c. Conservation Areas. Conservation Areas may be
required per II.11 Conservation Area.
d. Streamside Management Buffers. Streamside
management buffers may be required per the III.12
Streamside Management Buffer.
e. Scenic Corridor Buffers. Scenic Corridor Buffers may
be required (refer to II.8.C(9)).
5. Total Amount of Designated Open Space. The
following total amounts of designated open space
apply to all Subdivisions fourteen (14) acres or greater.
a. Minimum Total Amount of Open Space. Upon
meeting the requirements for each category, a
minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the gross
Subdivision area shall be designated as open space
per II.1.D(2).
b. Permitted Reductions in Open Space Requirements.
Should the total of the open space category
requirements result in more than fifty (50) percent
of the gross Subdivision area for all Types with the
exception of Type V, some of the open space areas
shall be reduced as follows.
(1) The resulting total open space area shall
constitute a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the
gross Subdivision area.
(2) The following permitted reductions shall
be taken in the following order to reach the
minimum amount open space.
(a) Conservation Area C. Conservation Area C, as
defined by II.11.H, may be reduced.
(b) City-Wide Greenways. City-wide greenways
for off-street paths and trails may be reduced
or eliminated unless no other connection
opportunity exists.
(c) City-Wide Parks. The fee-in-lieu of Dedication
of land may be utilized for city-wide parks.
(d) Conservation Area Connections. Required
connections between Conservation Areas
may be reduced.
(e) Neighborhood Scale Open Space
Requirement. Conservation Areas and
Streamside Management Buffers may
be utilized to meet the requirements of
the Neighborhood Scale Open Space
Requirement as long as the Conservation
Area or Streamside Management Buffer
meets the distance requirement.
(f ) Conservation Area B. Conservation Area B
may be reduced. If the resulting area is less
than two (2) acres, Area B may be eliminated.
(g) Conservation Area A. Conservation Area A
may be reduced with the approval of the

two (2) faces, preferably on the longest Street Faces,
with the exception of Blocks along Scenic Corridors.
d. Maximum Block sizes (length and depth) are
defined in the specific requirements for each
Neighborhood Type.
e. Block configurations may vary when they include
Conservation Areas and Open Space.
2. Minimum Number of Intersections per Square Mile of
Developable Area.
a. Intent. The intent for this measurement is to ensure
a minimum number of directional choices for all
modes of transportation within a neighborhood on
a scale small enough to accommodate a pedestrian.
b. Measurement. All Subdivisions are required to
include a minimum number of intersections,
defined in the specific requirements for each
Neighborhood Type, measured as follows. (Refer to
Figure 1.E-2).
(1) Number of Intersections. Intersections include
all locations where a minimum of two (2) street
centerlines intersect, including all Street Types
except Alleys. Street centerlines shall intersect
at a three-way or greater intersection to count
towards this requirement.
(2) Square Mile of Developable Area. The number
of intersections in a neighborhood is divided by
the number of square miles of Developable Area
in the Subdivision. The term Developable Area
is defined in I.2.B; it excludes all area zoned OS5
(Conservation Areas, Streamside Buffer Zones,
and Scenic Corridor Buffers).
(3) Open Space Exemption. Any area with an OS 3:
General Open Space or OS4: Outdoor Recreation
District larger than five (5) acres may be
removed from the intersection calculation.
3. Minimum Miles of Street Centerlines per Square Mile
of Developable Area.
a. Intent. This measurement is intended to accompany
minimum Block size and the minimum number
of intersections to ensure that Blocks are scaled
comfortably to the pedestrian and provide access to
the entire Subdivision.
b. Measurement. All Subdivisions are required to
include a minimum number of Street Centerlines
per square mile of Developable Area, measured as
follows. Refer to Figure 1.E-3.
(1) Number of Miles of Street Centerlines. The Street
Centerlines are measured in miles, continuous
through all intersections and ending at the
Parcel boundary, another centerline at a T
intersection, or the center of a cul-de-sac.
(2) Square Mile of Developable Area. The number
of miles of Street Centerlines in a Subdivision
is divided by the number of square miles of
five (35) feet in depth for no more than two
hundred (200) feet along the Scenic Corridor.
(i) Streamside Management Buffer. As a final
effort, the streamside management buffers
may be reduced with the approval of the
MPC, with a recommendation by the NRB
c. Documentation. In the Preliminary Plat application,
the Applicant shall include a table of required open
space with the following information.
(1) Total gross acreage of Subdivision Plat.
(2) Total acreage of open space required and
percentage of total gross acreage of the
Subdivision.
(3) Each category of open space required and the
acreage of each category provided.
(4) Any acreage reductions proposed per II.1.D(5)
(b).
E. General Block, Lot, and Street Design.
The following are general requirements for all Subdivisions.
Specific requirements are outlined for each Neighborhood
Type.
1. Required Block Configuration. Refer to Figure 1.E-1 for
an illustration of Typical Block Elements.
a. The shape of a Block shall be generally rectangular,
but may vary due to natural features or site
constraints.
b. Blocks shall typically be two (2) Lots deep with the
exception of Blocks containing Conservation Areas
or Open Space. Blocks may also include an Alley.
c. Blocks shall typically be fronted with Lots on at least

Figure 1.E-4.
a. Mid-Block Alley. This configuration includes an Alley
running through the center of the Block. This type
of Alley is appropriate for all types of development.
b. T Alley. This configuration includes two (2) Alleys
within a Block that are perpendicular to each other,
forming a T.
(1) This configuration is appropriate for both
residential and commercial development.
(2) It is ideal for Blocks on the Neighborhood Street
Type that are directly adjacent to larger streets
such as Avenues or Connectors.
(3) The T allows development to front on both
the local and larger Street Types. It also allows
for a transition between different districts, such
as residential facing one street and commercial

Section 8 - Street Type Standards
Section 8 - Street Type Standards
A. General Requirements.
1. Intent. The standards outlined in this Section are
intended to accomplish the following.
a. Create a logical and comprehensible system of
streets and street names that result in a simple,
consistent and understandable pattern of Blocks,
Lots, and house numbers.
b. Encourage safe and efficient traffic flow and
provide adequate access to all Lots for vehicles and
pedestrians.
c. Create streets that are appropriate for their
contexts in residential, commercial, or mixed Use
districts and are designed to encourage travel at
appropriate volumes and speeds.
d. Encourage streets that respect natural features by
following topography and drainage systems, rather
than interrupting or dead-ending at the feature.
e. Create streets and public Rights-of-Way that
result in stormwater runoff quantity reduction and
improved quality of stormwater runoff.
2. Applicability. These standards apply to all vehicular
Rights-of-Way within the City.
3. Authority. This Section, II.8 Street Type Standards,
falls within Subdivision authority, per the State
of Tennessee, and is regulated by the Municipal
Planning Commission (MPC).
4. General Requirements. All proposed streets, Planting
or Furnishings Zones, and sidewalks shall be located
in dedicated vehicular Rights-of-Way as required by
this Section.
a. Public Street. All vehicular Rights-of-Way, with
the exception of Alleys, shall be dedicated for
public Use, unless otherwise stated in II.8.A(4),
below.
b. Private streets, with the exception of private Alleys,
are permitted when all of the following conditions
are met:
(1) The Subdivision is located adjacent to a City
Waterway with no bridge connection or the
boundary of another municipality with no
existing connecting street.
(2) None of the streets in the Subdivision are
included in the Major Roads Plan as part of the
Recommended Transportation Plan.
(3) Any access limitation, including gating of the
street, shall be considered for approval, approval
with conditions, disapproval, or other applicable
action separately by the MPC and shall not
interrupt the pedestrian, vehicular, and bicycle
connectivity through the City or to any public
open space.
(4) The private Rights-of-Way and street
configuration shall be designed to the standards
herein, including one of the Street Types.
c. Private Alleys are permitted, but shall be designed
to meet the standards herein.
d. Right-of-Way Features. Where the design
requirements stipulate the provision of turning
lanes, turning radii, center medians, traffic control
devices, or other installations which cannot be
installed within the existing Right-of-Way (as
otherwise required without the elimination of or
conflict between those features and other Public
Improvements), the developer shall dedicate
such additional Right-of-Way as is necessary to
accommodate all such improvements.
5. AASHTO standards. When a requirement is defined
as per AASHTO standards, refer to A Policy
on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,
most current edition, prepared by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO).
6. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). All designs
shall conform to the most recent version of the ADA
standards and any more stringent State of Tennessee
regulation.
7. Street Names. New street names shall follow the
Memphis Light, Gas, and Waters (MLGW) Street
Naming Guide for Memphis and Shelby County,
Tennessee, available at City Hall.
a. Existing Street Names. All existing street names
that do not follow MLGW standards may continue
to be used and those names may be used on
extensions of the existing street.
b. Cul-de-sac Streets. Cul-de-sac street names shall be
a continuation of the street of which they are a part.
8. City Standards. Streets, sidewalks, and pedestrian ways,
shall be constructed in accordance with the City of
Lakeland Manual for Public Works Construction and
Material Specifications.
B. Map of Street Types.
To better apply the provisions of these Land Development
Regulations and to provide context for any future Rightsof-
Way and future improvements to existing Rights-of-Way,
existing streets and streets designated as future on the
Comprehensive Plan are mapped in accordance with the
Street Types outlined in II.G through P Street Type Standards
(refer to Figure 8.B). This map is provided for reference
only. Should the information included conflict with the
Comprehensive Plan, the Comprehensive Plan shall prevail. .

C. General Street Type Standards.
1. Street Types. The Street Types outline acceptable street
configurations. New streets shall be designed using
the principles and characteristics defined by each
Street Type. The MPC may require additional Right-of-
Way, pavement width, or additional street elements
depending on unique site characteristics.
2. Summary Street Type Table. Table 8.C-2 summarizes
the requirements of each Street Type.
3. Conservation Street Overlay. A Conservation Street
Overlay may be required or optionally utilized over
another Street Type when there are considerable
natural resources to be preserved. Refer to II.8.P
for specific requirements of the Conservation Street
Overlay.
4. Graphics. The graphics provided here for each Street
Type illustrate only one possible configuration of that
Street Type. By applying the standards outlined, other
configurations may be determined acceptable per
II.8.A(1) Intent.
5. Typical Street Elements. Typical elements of
a vehicular Right-of-Way are divided into the
Vehicular and Pedestrian Realm. Each Street Type
outlines which facilities are applicable. Refer to
Figure 8.C-1: Typical Right-of-Way Elements.
a. Vehicular Realm. The vehicular realm is comprised
of the travel lanes, bicycle lanes, and parking lanes.
b. Pedestrian Realm. The pedestrian realm is
typically comprised of pedestrian facilities, such
as sidewalk, path/trail, or off-street bicycle path,
and a buffer area, consisting of a Planting Zone or
Furnishings Zone that serves to buffer pedestrians
or bicyclists from the movements of higher speed
vehicles in the vehicular realm.
(1) Planting Zone. A Landscape Area from the
back of curb or edge of pavement to the
sidewalk in which street trees, Swales, lighting,
and signage may be located. Sidewalks may
cross the Planting Zone. Typically used
adjacent to residential buildings.
(2) Furnishings Zone. A hardscape area that extends
the sidewalk to the back of curb, in which street
trees in Tree Wells, street furniture, lighting, and
signage may be located. Typically used adjacent
to commercial or office buildings and requires
approval of MPC.
6. Bicycle Facilities.
a. Bicycle facilities shall be provided per the Citys
current Comprehensive Plan.
b. Three (3) types of bicycle accommodations are
permitted in the vehicular realm.
(1) Dedicated Bicycle Lane. Dedicated bicycle
lanes are striped lanes on the outside of the
outermost travel lanes that are designated for
only bicycle use. This lane occurs on both sides
of the street and shall be five (5) to six (6) feet
wide. Refer to Figure 8.C-2.
(2) Designated Shared Lane. A designated shared
lane is a lane that is shared between vehicles
and bicycles. This lane has a minimum width of
fourteen (14) feet. An arrow and bicycle symbol
is painted on the outer edge of the lane to
denote shared use. This improvement occurs on
both directions. Refer to Figure 8.C-2.

(3) Shared Lane. A shared lane refers to a street
that does not have bicycle lanes or a designated
shared lane, but the speed and configuration of
the street is such that bicycles could comfortably
share lanes with traffic.
7. Fire Access. Street configurations have been
calculated to provide fire truck access. Where the
total width of all travel lanes totaled is narrower than
twenty-two (22) feet, the following shall apply.
a. Room to Pass. At one hundred (100) foot
increments, a twenty (20) foot opening in the
on-street parking or a twenty (20) foot dedicated
pull-off space shall be provided to allow vehicles to
pull over for a fire truck to pass.
b. Driveway or Fire Hydrant Zone. A driveway or
fire hydrant zone may be utilized to fulfill the
requirement.
c. County Fire Regulations. Refer to the Shelby County
Fire Prevention Code, as amended, for additional
information when applicable.
8. Vehicular On-Street Parking. On-street parking, as
permitted on designated Street Types, shall meet the
following requirements.
a. Parallel and diagonal parking is permitted on
designated Street Types.
b. Vehicular Parking Space Dimensions. The
appropriate dimensions for parking spaces are
outlined in Table 8.C-1 On-Street Parking Space
Dimensions and Figure 8.C-3 Diagonal On-street
Parking Layout. The width of a parking space shall
be measured from the center of a stripe.
9. Scenic Corridor Buffer. For the Scenic Corridor Street
Type, Scenic Corridor Buffers are required adjacent to
the existing or proposed street Right-of-Way.
a. Intent. Scenic Corridor Buffers are intended to
preserve and extend the existing landscape
character adjacent to the street so that the result
is a consistent native tree buffer. Where a trail
does no occur in the right-of-way, these buffers

b. Platting. Scenic Corridor Buffers shall be established
according to the following:
(1) For new Subdivisions (refer to I.4.C Preliminary
Plat), Buffers shall be platted as separate Lots
and zoned OS5.
(2) Buffers shall be fully accessible from the
adjacent street Right-of-Way, so the street Rightof-
Way and the Buffer is continuous.
(3) Fences are not permitted within Scenic Corridor
Buffers.
(4) No structures shall be permitted in the Buffers.
c. Size. Refer to Street Type for size of Buffer.
d. Exception. See II.D.5(b) for potential reduction in
Scenic Corridor Buffer.
e. Tree Planting and Preservation Requirements.

c. The use of the cul-de-sac is limited by Neighborhood
Type. Refer to II.1 through 7. The use of eyebrows is
not limited.
(1) The number of cul-de-sacs may be permitted
to exceed the cul-de-sac cap when one of the
following conditions are met:
(a) The placement of the cul-de-sac can be
demonstrated to avoid natural features
deemed to be of high value per the
Qualifying Features Delineation (refer
to II.11.B), while also not substantively
interfering with the objective of making
conservation areas visible and accessible
from the street within the overall Subdivision
and adjacent developments. This includes
locations adjacent to a City Waterway with
no bridge connection, and designated type A
or B conservation areas.
(2) The placement of the cul-de-sac is at the
boundary of another municipality with
no existing connecting street, at railroad
tracks, or at major utility Easements (such
as regional electrical transmission lines or
interstate gas lines).
(3) The placement of the cul-de-sac avoids
extreme topography, such that the
alternative to the proposed cul-de-sac street
would have otherwise required a combined
cut-fill in excess of eight (8) feet in the
immediate area.
3. General Underlying Street Requirements. The
following general requirements of the underlying
Street Type shall be maintained:
a. Pedestrian facilities are required on the outside of
cul-de-sac or eyebrow only.
b. Any required Street Buffer is required on the
outside of cul-de-sac or eyebrow only.

137
II. Neighborhood Development Regulations
Section 10 - Stormwater Management
1. Design and construction of stormwater
management systems shall conform to all specifications and
procedures established by the City by code, ordinance, or
policy.
2. Treat Stormwater as a Valuable Resource. All
stormwater shall be treated as a valuable resource not as a
waste product. Stormwater shall be collected, stored, and
reused to reduce surface water runoff.
3. Replicate Natural Hydrology. The stormwater
management system shall replicate the pre- development
natural hydrology of the site, protecting natural
drainageways, following the natural topography of the site,
and preserving the natural infiltration characteristics of the
site.
4. Treat Stormwater Where It Falls. All stormwater
shall be managed close to where it falls on the site, reducing
the need for lengthy, single purpose conveyance.
5. Minimize Discharge. The system shall minimize
surface water discharge in smaller, more frequent rainfall
events, and minimize the downstream impact of larger,
more intense rain events which are far less frequent.
6. Integrate Stormwater and Open Space. All
stormwater management systems shall be an integral part
of the neighborhood design and the open space design
within the neighborhood, and shall serve the dual function
of naturally managing the stormwater and creating usable
open space. Applicable open space types of the Lakeland
Zoning Ordinance are incorporated by reference into these
subdivision regulations, and an applicable open space type
shall be utilized.
7. Integrate with Natural Resource Management. The
location and design of the stormwater management system
shall be closely integrated with the Citys Natural Resource
Inventory and Assessment, to maintain and enhance
the Citys Natural areas, including respecting the unique
geology, soils, landscape cover, slopes, and long-term
maintenance objectives of Conservation Areas.
8. Stormwater Sewer System. Stormwater sewer
systems shall be utilized as needed to convey heavy rainfall
events beyond the requirements defined in herein, and
at locations where naturalized stormwater treatment is
infeasible.
9. System Design Hierarchy. The design of the
stormwater management system for all sites shall use the
following hierarchy of methods of managing stormwater.
a. Natural Resource Conservation. Preserve and do
not negatively affect natural resource features of the
development site, including wetlands, Open Water, and
woodlands.

negatively affect existing natural streams, channels, and
drainageways.
c. Vegetated Swales. Primarily utilize open, vegetated Swales
to convey stormwater runoff.
d. Natural Infiltration. Preserve the natural infiltration and
storage characteristics of the site.
e. Water Quality Structures. As needed, utilize structural
measures that provide water quality and quantity control.
f. Structural Conveyance. Utilize structural measures that
provide only quantity control and conveyance in instances
where vegetated Swales and natural infiltration are
infeasible.
C. Design Standards.
1. Design of Stormwater Facilities. Minimum
design standards for stormwater facilities shall follow
the Memphis Shelby County Stormwater Design Manual,
the City of Lakeland Subdivision Regulations, and The

Management and Pollution Control Ordinance, whichever
is the more stringent. Detention Volumes and Maximum
Release Rates are specified below.
2. Detention Volume. The required detention volume shall
be that volume necessary, given the hydraulic characteristics
of the primary outlet structure, to attenuate the postdevelopment
mass outflow of water from the structure
from hour 11 to hour 18 of the 24-hour storm to a level not
to exceed the pre-development mass outflow for the same
time period for both the 2-year and 5-year, 24-hour storms.
3. Maximum Release Rate. The release rate from any
detention facility shall be for the site for the same storm
prior to the proposed development. The peak outflow
rate from the 2 year-24 hour storm, 10 year- 24 hour storm
and 25 year-24 hour storm shall not exceed that of the
site prior to development. Detention facilities shall have a
primary discharge structure capable of accommodating the
24-hour storms up through the 25-year with an emergency
overflow capable of handling at least the 100-year, 24-hour
post-development discharge unless waived by the Planning
Commission.
4. Storm Sewer Design Requirements. Design storm
frequency for land use/development type for storm sewer
systems shall be as follows:

B. Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
A Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (SESC) Plan
is required in accordance with the General Criteria
established in the Tennessee Department of Environment
and Conservation Erosion Sediment Control Handbook,
A Guide for Protection of State Waters through the use
of Best Management Practices during Land Disturbing
Activities, distributed by Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation, Second Edition March
2002 and any future amendments to same, is hereby
adopted. The handbook shall be used to develop the SESC
Plan and as guidance in methods and materials in the
installation and construction of erosion control measures as
shown on the approved plan.
1. The SESC Plan shall be designed and worded
to address all potential field conditions to ensure
compliance with the intent of these regulations.
2. The SESC Plan shall be stamped and sealed by a
professional engineer.
3. The SESC Plan, at minimum, shall include the
following:
a. A list and brief description of each control measure
that will be used.
b. A scaled site map clearly showing the existing and
proposed contour lines, drainage ways, north arrow
and location and type of each erosion and sediment
control measure.
c. An implementation sequence indicating the
order in which the erosion and sediment control
activities will take place.
d. An inspection and maintenance schedule for all
disturbed areas, material storage areas and erosion
and sediment controls that were identified in the
plan. This schedule shall identify, at a minimum,
all erosion and sediment control measures to be
inspected every seven (7) calendar days and within
24 hours of any storm event exceeding 1/2-inch
precipitation.
e. Designated areas for equipment maintenance and
repair.
f. Provisions for waste receptacles at convenient
locations, the regular collection of waste, protected
storage areas for chemicals, paints, solvents,
fertilizers and other potentially toxic materials and

the SESC Plan shall be submitted with the
Construction Plans process.
a. The City Engineers signature of approval is
required on all SESC Plans.
b. Approval of the Construction Plans shall constitute
approval of the SESC Plan.
5. Other Permits. All other required permits must
be obtained from other federal, state, and local
governments. Copies of approvals from other
agencies shall be provided to the City to assure
compliance.
C. Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Techniques.
1. Phasing and Disturbance.
a. Minimize the extent of the area exposed at one
time and the duration of the exposure.
b. Stabilize disturbed areas immediately after soil
exposure or disturbance or after finish grade has
been attained.
c. Verify that flows of water redirected from
construction areas or generated by construction
activity do not enter or cross Protection Zones
unless no other path exists, refer to II.12.
Crossing Protection Zones shall be minimized and
consolidated.
157
II. Neighborhood Development Regulations
Section 13 - Soil Erosion and Sediment Control During Construction
d. No soil storage piles shall be located with a
downslope drainage length of less than thirty-five
(35) feet from wetlands, channels, detention basins
or drainage Swales.
(1) Cover or vegetate (with an appropriate grass
matrix) soil stock piles that remain on site
longer than two weeks.
(2) Filter fence or equivalent shall be installed
at a minimum distance of ten (10) feet from
stockpile edge to reduce water build-up behind
fence and potential failure of sediment control
structure.
(3) Do not store soil stockpiles within Critical Root
Zone of remaining trees or within protection
areas.
e. SESC shall remain in place and in functioning
condition for the duration of construction activity
and until the areas that they protect are completely
stabilized.
f. At the completion of the project, stormwater
management facilities shall be inspected by the City
to determine any cleaning or flushing of trapped
sediment which may be required due to erosion.
The responsibility for any needed cleaning or
flushing lies with the site developer.
2. Erosion Control Practices:
a. Apply perimeter control practices such as silt
fences or earthen dikes to protect the disturbed
area from offsite runoff and to filter concentrated
runoff from the site to prevent sedimentation
damage to areas below/downslope of the
development site.
b. Remove sediment from storm water before it
leaves the site by allowing runoff to pond in
controlled areas (traps or basins) or by using
vegetative cover, silt fences or hay bales.
c. Keep runoff velocities low and retain runoff on the
site.
d. Direct upslope water to other rainwater facilities to
avoid disturbed areas.
e. Transport surplus surface runoff down steep
slopes through lined channels or piping. Ensure
appropriate conditions at the bottom of the slope
to avoid any impact from piped or channeled water
and diffuse the energy and volume of the storm
flow.
f. Straw bales or silt fence filters are required around
inlet structures, catch basins, manholes, and other
stormwater management facilities and structures.
g. Construction entrances shall be limited to two per
site and shall be kept clean during the process.
h. Washing or cleaning of equipment shall be
relegated to a designated area with appropriate
controls.
i. Examples of acceptable temporary structural
SESC controls include diversion, silt fences, straw
bale barriers, storm drain inlet protection, outlet
protection, sediment traps, sediment basins, slope
drains, subsurface drains, riprap, check dams,
level spreaders, paved flumes, construction road
stabilization and temporary gravel construction
entrances and exits.
j. Examples of acceptable vegetative SESC include
vegetative buffer zones, protection of trees,
temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching,
topsoiling, erosion & sediment control blankets
and surface roughening. Sod is not an acceptable
vegetative SESC control.
k. If it is necessary to remove topsoil, remove sod and
grass before stripping and reuse topsoil on site.
(1) Grade and shape topsoil stockpiles to drain
surface water and cover stockpiles to prevent
erosion by wind or water.
(2) Do not stockpile topsoil within Protection
Zones.
(3) If supplemental topsoil is needed beyond what
is available on site, obtain from a local source.
3. Revegetation and Stabilization.
a. When natural drainage ways, including stream
channels, are disturbed, revegetate stream
banks with suitable native vegetation, and with
appropriate soil stabilization and establishment
practices.
b. All disturbed areas shall be stabilized with
appropriate temporary or permanent measures
within seven (7) calendar days of final grading
or when left idle for more than seven (7) days,
excluding maintained haul roads, sediment basins,
site runoff storage facilities, and utility corridors
less than twenty (20) feet in width.
c. If work is discontinued for thirty (30) days or more
in a disturbed area before the project is completed,
appropriate interim controls shall be initiated
within seven (7) calendar days from the day that
work was discontinued.
4. Inspection and Maintenance
a. Inspect, maintain, and repair SESC measures
during construction until permanent vegetation
has been established.
b. Damaged and ineffective erosion control measures
shall be repaired, replaced or supplemented within
forty-eight (48) hours of discovery or as soon as
field conditions allow.
c. Straw bales and silt fences shall be inspected
weekly and after rainfall event in excess of one
half inch to determine required repairs and/or
replacement. As a minimum, straw bales are to be
158
II. Neighborhood Development Regulations
Section 13 - Soil Erosion and Sediment Control During Construction
replaced every three (3) months or more frequently
as required by the City. If tributary drainage area
is greater than one acre, sediment basins shall be
constructed in addition to using straw bales and silt
fences.
D. Post-Construction Restoration.
1. Vegetation native to the site or plant community
shall be restored in areas affected by construction
activities. Temporary vegetation, sufficient to stabilize
the soil, shall be required on all disturbed areas as
needed to prevent soil erosion.
2. Following development, the infiltration capacity shall
be restored and compaction of soils shall be reduced
by breaking up compaction, adding organic matter,
and planting vegetation.

which a Facade has clear, transparent windows on each
story.
1. Arcades, Storefronts, and Shopfronts Buildings.
(Refer to Figure 3.F-1)
a. Transparency Measured by Floor. On buildings
with an arcade, storefront, or shopfront Base
Type, Transparency is measured with a separate
percentage for the Ground Story Transparency and
the Upper Story Transparency.
b. Ground Story Transparency. Transparency is
measured on the Facade per requirements defined
in III.3.C Base Types.
c. Upper Story. The Upper Story Transparency level
is measured by story, from floor to floor. Refer to
III.3.C Base Types for the requirements.

2. Porch and Stoop Buildings. (Refer to Figure 3.F-2)
a. Transparency Measured by Facade. On residential
buildings with a porch or stoop Base Type,
Transparency is measured as a percentage of the
entire Facade and not by story.
b. Ground and Upper Stories. Transparency is
measured along the full Facade, including the
Facade of Half Stories. Refer to III.3.N through
W for the requirements.
3. Maximum Area of No Transparency. On front and
corner side Facades of applicable Building Types,
no rectangular area greater than thirty (30) percent
of the each storys Facade shall be blank, without
Transparency. This area is measured from floor to
floor of each story.
G. Measuring Coverage.
The following details how Impervious Surfaces on a Lot
are measured, including both Building Coverage and total
Site Coverage (Refer to Figure 3.G-1).
1. Building Coverage. The percentage of a Lot covered
by all structures, both principal and accessory.
2. Impervious Site Coverage. The percentage of a
Lot covered by all structures, both principal and
accessory; pavement; and other Impervious Surfaces.
3. Semi-Pervious Site Coverage. Within each Building
Type, an additional percentage of a Lot may be
surfaced in a Semi-Pervious material. Examples of
Semi-Pervious materials include but are not limited
to permeable pavers, permeable asphalt, and buildings
or portions of buildings covered by Green Roofs.

288
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 7 - Stormwater Management
B. General Design Principles.
Stormwater management systems are encouraged
to utilize the following principles. Figures 7.E.3
and 7.E.4 illustrate potential systems on a small
scale.
1. Design and construction of stormwater
management systems shall conform to all
specifications and procedures established by the
City by code, ordinance, or policy.
2. Treat Stormwater as a Valuable Resource. All
stormwater shall be treated as a valuable
resource not as a waste product. Stormwater
shall be collected, stored, and reused to reduce
surface water runoff.
3. Replicate Natural Hydrology. The stormwater
management system shall replicate the predevelopment
natural hydrology of the site,
protecting natural drainageways, following the
natural topography of the site, and preserving
the natural infiltration characteristics of the site.
4. Treat Stormwater Where It Falls. All stormwater
shall be managed close to where it falls on
the site, reducing the need for lengthy, single
purpose conveyance.
5. Minimize Discharge. The system shall minimize
surface water discharge in smaller, more
frequent rainfall events, and minimize the
downstream impact of larger, more intense rain
events which are far less frequent.
6. Integrate Stormwater and Open Space. All
stormwater management systems shall be an
integral part of the neighborhood design and
the open space design within the neighborhood,
and shall serve the dual function of naturally
managing the stormwater and creating usable
open space. Applicable open space types of this
ordinance shall be utilized.
7. Integrate with Natural Resource Management.
The location and design of the stormwater
management system shall be closely integrated
with the Citys Natural Resource Inventory and
Assessment, to maintain and enhance the Citys
Natural areas, including respecting the unique
geology, soils, landscape cover, slopes, and longterm
maintenance objectives of Conservation
Areas.
8. Stormwater Sewer System. Stormwater sewer
systems shall be utilized as needed to convey
heavy rainfall events beyond the requirements
defined in herein, and at locations where
naturalized stormwater treatment is infeasible.
9. System Design Hierarchy. The design of the
stormwater management system for all sites
shall use the following hierarchy of methods of
managing stormwater.
a. Natural Resource Conservation. Preserve and do
not negatively affect natural resource features of
the development site, including wetlands, Open
Water, and woodlands.
b. Existing Natural Drainageways. Preserve and do
not negatively affect existing natural streams,
channels, and drainageways.
c. Vegetated Swales. Primarily utilize open,
vegetated Swales to convey stormwater runoff.
d. Natural Infiltration. Preserve the natural
infiltration and storage characteristics of the
site.
e. Water Quality Structures. As needed, utilize
structural measures that provide water quality
and quantity control.
f. Structural Conveyance. Utilize structural
measures that provide only quantity control
and conveyance in instances where vegetated
Swales and natural infiltration are infeasible.
C. Design Standards.
1. Design of Stormwater Facilities. Minimum
design standards for stormwater facilities shall
follow the Memphis Shelby County Stormwater
Design Manual, the City of Lakeland Zoning
Ordinance, and The Lakeland Municipal Code,
Title 13, Chapter 6, Storm Water Management
and Pollution Control Ordinance, whichever is
the more stringent. Detention Volumes and
Maximum Release Rates are specified below.
2. Detention Volume. The required detention
volume shall be that volume necessary, given
the hydraulic characteristics of the primary
outlet structure, to attenuate the postdevelopment
mass outflow of water from
the structure from hour 11 to hour 18 of the
24-hour storm to a level not to exceed the predevelopment
mass outflow for the same time
period for both the 2-year and 5-year, 24-hour
storms.
3. Maximum Release Rate. The release rate from
any detention facility shall be for the site for the
same storm prior to the proposed development.
The peak outflow rate from the 2 year-24 hour
storm, 10 year- 24 hour storm and 25 year-24
hour storm shall not exceed that of the site
prior to development. Detention facilities shall
have a primary discharge structure capable of
accommodating the 24-hour storms up through
the 25-year with an emergency overflow capable
of handling at least the 100-year, 24-hour post-
289
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 7 - Stormwater Management
development discharge unless waived by the
Planning Commission.
4. Storm Sewer Design Requirements. Design storm
frequency for land use/development type for
storm sewer systems shall be as follows:
a. Residential - 25 years;
b. Commercial/business/industrial - 25 years;
For drainage swales, lined channels, and natural
channels the system shall be designed to
carry the 100 year 24 hour storm and have the
capacity to convey storm runoff without life
hazard or property damage.
The methodology for hydrologic and hydraulic
design calculations for the pre-development
and post-development conditions for the design
storms is specified in the Memphis Shelby
County Stormwater Design Manual.
5. Conservation Area Requirements. Refer to
the Subdivision Regulations, Conservation
Area Requirements section. No stormwater
management facilities shall be located within
a Conservation Area Type A open space, nor
shall they be permitted with designs that are
detrimental to such open spaces.
6. Existing Water Features. Existing streams, lakes,
and wetlands shall not be modified for use as
stormwater detention or retention.
a. On-stream impoundments shall be prohibited.
b. Stream Buffer Requirements. Refer to the Zoning
Ordinance Streamside Management Buffers
section. No stormwater management facilities
shall be located within streamside buffers, nor
shall they be detrimental to such buffers, unless
a plan with appropriate mitigation is authorized
by the MPC.
c. Drainage to Lakes and Wetlands. Site drainage
patterns shall not be substantially altered to
decrease or increase the tributary area to lakes
or wetlands.
d. Existing wetlands shall not be used as stormwater
detention basins.
e. Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the
purposes of stormwater management facilities
unless it is demonstrated that the existing
wetland is low in quality and the proposed
modifications shall maintain or improve its
habitat and ability to perform beneficial
functions.
(1) Low quality wetlands are those that have been
substantially disturbed, usually reflected in low
native species diversity and habitat quality.
(2) All runoff shall be pretreated prior to discharge
and the runoff shall enter the wetland as
subsurface flow.
7. Easement Standards. Easements and/or Rights-of-
Way for stormwater facilities shall be of sufficient
width to permit installation, maintenance, or
repair within the confines of the Easement or
Right-of- Way without relocation of or other
unreasonable interference with other public
utilities. Easements shall be granted to the City
of Lakeland or another party defined in the
Operations and Maintenance Plan as the party
responsible for maintenance. .
8. Stormwater detention and surface infiltration
basins shall be designed as naturalized basins for
multiple uses including stormwater detention,
habitat enhancement, and passive recreational
use. Basins shall not be designed solely for
stormwater detention purposes.

Insurance Program and in order to do so must
meet the requirements of 60.3(d) of the Federal
Insurance Administration Regulations found at
44 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-88 Edition) and subsequent
amendments.
b. Areas Subject to Flooding. Areas of the City
of Lakeland are subject to periodic inundation
which could result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
c. Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by the
cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains,
causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and by uses in flood hazard areas which are
vulnerable to floods; or construction which is
inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
3. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this
Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This
Ordinance is designed to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to
water or erosion hazards, or which cause damaging
increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
community facilities, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains,
stream channels, and natural protective barriers
that accommodate flood waters
d. Control filling, grading, dredging and other
development that may increase erosion or flood
damage
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or
which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
4. Objectives. The objectives of this Ordinance are:
a. To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of
it citizenry.
b. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly
flood control projects
c. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and undertaken at the
expense of the general public.
d. To minimize prolonged business interruptions
e. To minimize damage to public facilities and
utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges
located in floodable areas
f. To help maintain a tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas to
minimize blight in flood areas
g. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that
property is in a floodable area
h. To maintain eligibility for participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
B. Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this Ordinance shall be interpreted as to give them
the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
Ordinance its most reasonable application.

principal structure and, for the purpose of this
section shall conform to the following:
a. Accessory structures shall not be used for human
habitation.
b. Accessory structures shall be designed to have low
flood damage potential.
c. Accessory structures shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
d. Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
which otherwise may result in damage to other
structures.
e. Utilities and service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or otherwise
protected from intrusion of floodwaters.
Act. The statutes authorizing the National Flood Insurance
Program that are incorporated in 42 U.S.C. 4001-4128.

III. Zoning Regulations
Section 11 - Floodplain Overlay District
developments (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the
lesser, include within such proposals base flood
elevation data.
d. Standards For Areas Of Special Flood Hazard Zones
AE With Established Base Flood Elevation But
Without Floodways Designated  Located within
the areas of special flood hazard established in
Section 3, where streams exist with base flood
data provided but where no floodways have been
provided, (Zone AE) the following provisions apply:
(1) Certification for Encroachments. No
encroachments, including fill material, new
structures or substantial improvements shall
be located within areas of special flood hazard,
unless certification by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within
the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles.
(2) Elevating or Flood-proofing. New construction
or substantial improvements of buildings shall
be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations
established in accordance with Section 3.
e. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and
AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood
hazard established in Section 3 are areas designated
as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths
of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate;
therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential buildings and nonresidential
buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least thirty
inches above the flood depth number specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet,
above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood
depth number is specified, the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be elevated, at least
three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided
in accordance with standards of Section 3 and
elevated buildings.
(2) All new construction and substantial
improvements of nonresidential buildings
may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. the
structure together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities must be flood proofed and
designed water tight to be completely flood
proofed to at least one (1) foot above the
specified firm flood level with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and the effects of buoyancy.
(a) If no depth number is specified, the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be flood
proofed to at least three (3) feet above
the highest adjacent grade. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the
provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the city engineer as set
forth above and as required in Section 3.
(b) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided
around slopes to guide floodwaters around
and away from proposed structures.
(c) The administrator shall certify the elevation
or the highest adjacent grade, where
applicable, and the record shall become a
permanent part of the permit file.
(3) Drainage Paths. Adequate drainage paths shall
be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters
around and away from proposed structures.
f. Standards for Areas Protected by Flood Protection
System (A-99 Zones). Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in Section 3.B are
areas of the one hundred (100)-year floodplain
protected by a flood protection system but where
base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have
not been determined. Within these areas (A-99
Zones), all provisions of Section 3 shall apply.
g. Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard
with Established Base Flood Elevation and With
Floodways Designated. Located within the areas
of special flood hazard established in Section 3 are
areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition,
the area must remain free of encroachment in order
to allow for discharge of the base flood without
increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore
the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including
earthen fill material, new construction,
substantial improvements or other
313
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 11 - Floodplain Overlay District
developments within the regulatory floodway.
Development may be permitted however,
provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practices that
the cumulative effect of the proposed
encroachments or new development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not result in any increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood
level, velocities or floodway widths during
the occurrence of a base flood discharge at
any point within the community. A registered
professional engineer must provide supporting
technical data and certification thereof.
(2) New construction or substantial improvement of
buildings shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provision of Section 3.
h. Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard with
Established Base Flood Elevations but Without
Floodways Designated (AE Zones)- Located within
the City of Lakeland established in Section 3 where
streams exist with base flood data provided but
where no floodways have been designated (Zones
AE) the following provisions apply
(1) No encroachments, including fill material, new
structures or substantial improvements shall
be located within areas of special flood hazard,
unless certification by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot an any point within
the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles
(2) New construction or substantial improvements
of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed
to elevations established in accordance with
Section 3.
i. Standards for Streams Without Established Base
Flood Elevations or Floodways (A Zones). Located
within the areas of special flood hazard established
in article iii, where streams exist, but no base flood
data has been provided (A Zones), or where a
floodway has not been delineated, the following
provisions shall apply:
(1) When base flood elevation data or floodway
data have not been provided in accordance with
Section 3, then the city engineer shall obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any scientific or
historic base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, in
order to administer the provisions of Section 3.
Only if data is not available from these sources,
then the following provisions (b & c) shall apply:
(2) No encroachments, including structures or
fill material, shall be located within an area
equal to the width of the stream or twenty
feet, whichever is greater, measured from the
top of the stream bank, unless certification by
registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one (1) foot at any
point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic
engineering principles.
(3) In special flood hazard areas without base flood
elevation data, new construction or substantial
improvements of existing shall have the lowest
floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) elevated no less than three (3)
feet above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate
the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall
be provided in accordance with the standards of
Section 3 and elevated buildings.
j Standards for Subdivision. Subdivisions and
other proposed new developments, including
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, shall be
reviewed to determine whether such proposals will
be reasonably safe from flooding. All subdivision
proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage. If a subdivision proposal
or other proposed new development is in a floodprone
area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to
ensure that:
(1) Public Utilities and Facilities. All subdivision
proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
(2) Drainage. All subdivision proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
(3) Base Flood Elevation Data. Base flood elevation
data shall be provided for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
which is greater than fifty (50) lots and/or five (5)
acres.
314
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 11 - Floodplain Overlay District
(4) Streets. The lowest point of all subdivision
streets shall be no less than twelve (12) inches
above base flood elevations.
(5) Design  Subdivision designs will include a
routing of the 100 year storm through the
development. Minimum finish floor elevations
will be set by the developers engineers on
critical lots to ensure thirty (30) inches above the
100 year storm is maintained.
4. Variance Procedures.
(1) The City of Lakeland Board of Appeals shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances
from the requirements of this Chapter.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see
definition) upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structures continued designation
as a historic structure and the variance is the
minimum to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
(3) In passing upon such applications, the Board of
Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations,
all relevant factors, all standards specified in
other sections of this Ordinance, and:
(a) The danger that material may be swept onto
other property to the injury of others.
(b) The danger to life and property due to
flooding or erosion;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility
and its contents to flood damage;
(d) The importance of the services provided by
the proposed facility to the community.
(e) The necessity of the facility to a waterfront
location, in the case of a functionally
dependent facility;
(f ) The availability of alternative locations, not
subject to flooding or erosion damage, for
the proposed use.
(g) The relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area.
(h) The safety of access to the property in times
of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(i) The expected heights, velocity, duration,
rate of rise and sediment transport of the
flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site, and;
(j) The costs of providing governmental services
during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
(4) Upon consideration of the factors listed above,
and the purposes of this Ordinance, the Board
of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances, as it deems necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this Ordinance.
(5) Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
b. Conditions for Variances.
(1) Minimum Relief Necessary. Variances shall be
issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum relief necessary.
(2) Justification of Need. Variances shall only
be issued upon (1) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (2) a determination that
failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and (3) a determination
that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or Ordinances.
(3) Written Notice. Any applicant to whom a
variance is granted shall be given written notice
that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood level will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance,
and that such construction below the base
flood level increases risks to life and property.
(4) Record Keeping and Reporting. The City
Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.

III. Zoning Regulations
Section 12 - Streamside Management Buffers
A. General Requirements.
1. Intent. It is the intent of this section to establish
a Streamside Management Buffer to restrict
development and limit land use adjacent to all
perennial streams and rivers in Lakeland. The
purposes of the Streamside Management Buffer
are: to protect public and private water supplies, to
trap sediment and other pollutants in surface runoff,
to promote bank stabilization, to protect riparian
wetlands, to minimize the impacts of floods, to
prevent increases or decreases in base flow, to protect
wildlife habitat, and to generally maintain water
quality. The quality of the groundwater that is used
for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes in
the City of Lakeland and Shelby County, Tennessee
is connected with the quality of the surface water in
the streams and rivers of Lakeland. Furthermore, the
Board of Commissioners finds that the protection
of the streams and rivers of Lakeland is vital to the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens.
2. Applicability. This Article shall apply to the
following:
a. This Article shall apply to all proposed development
except for that development which meets variance
criteria as outlined in Section G of this Article.
b. This Article is intended to modify the location
of new development in relation to streams and
other water resources but not to modify its
overall density. The provisions here shall apply
to the construction of any building or any land
disturbance resulting from or in connection with
any activity or use requiring any of the following:
i. Building Permit
ii. Board of Zoning Appeals (Variance)
iii. Special Exception approval
iv. Subdivision/Planned Development/Site Plan
approval
v. Grading Permit/Land Disturbance Permit.
c. This Article shall apply to all timber harvesting
activities, except those timber harvesting operations
which are implementing a forest management plan
that has been deemed to be in compliance with this
Article.
d. This Article shall apply to surface mining
operations except that the design standards shall
not apply to active surface mining operations that
are operating in compliance with an approved
surface mining permit issued by the State of
Tennessee.
e. Except as provided in Section G of this Article, this
Article shall apply to all parcels of land, structures,
and activities that are causing or contributing to:
i. Pollution, including nonpoint source pollution,
of the waters of the State of Tennessee
ii. Erosion or sedimentation of stream channels
iii. Degradation of aquatic or riparian habitat
3. The standards and regulations set forth in this
Article are created under the authority of the City of
Lakelands zoning powers granted by Sections 13-7-
201 through 13-7-210, Tennessee Code Annotated,
to provide for the establishment of districts within
the corporate limits of the City of Lakeland. In the
event of a conflict between or among any provision
of this Ordinance, or any other ordinances of the
City of Lakeland, the requirement that is most
restrictive and protective of water quality shall apply.
4. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the

conditions, or disapprove the boundaries and related
conditions pertaining thereto. The decision of the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final.
C. Streamside Management Buffer Use and
Regulations.
1. Streamside Management Buffer District
The Streamside Management Buffer (hereinafter
referred to as SMB) is an overlay buffer zone that
encompasses all land within fifty (50) feet unless
additional buffer is required due to the size of the
drainage basin served by the stream on either side
of all streams in the City of Lakeland, measured as a
horizontal line extending perpendicular from the top
of the stream bank immediately adjoining the subject
parcel(s). The SMB must be maintained in a naturally
vegetated state. Any property or portion thereof that
lies within the SMB is subject to the restrictions of
the SMB as well as any and all zoning restrictions that
apply to the tax parcel as a whole.
2. Distinct Sections within Streamside Management
Buffer. The Streamside Management Buffer shall be
composed of two distinct zones, with each zone
having its own set of allowable uses and vegetative
targets as specified in this Article (see Figure 12.C-1).
1. Zone 1. Streamside Section
i. The function of the streamside section is to
protect the physical and ecological integrity of
the stream ecosystem.
ii. The streamside section will begin at the edge
of the stream bank of the active channel and
extend a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from
the top of the bank.
iii. Allowable uses within the streamside section
are highly restricted to:
1. flood control structures;
2. utility rights-of-way;
3. footpaths; or
4. road crossings, where permitted.
iv. The vegetative target for the streamside section
is undisturbed native vegetation.
2. Zone 2. Outer Section
i. The function of the outer section is to protect
key components of the stream, to prevent
encroachment into the SMB, filter runoff from
residential and commercial development, and to
provide transition between upland development
and the streamside section.
ii. The outer section will begin at the outer edge of
the streamside section and extend a minimum
of twenty-five (25) feet plus any additional
streamside management buffer width as
specified in Section D of this section.
iii. There shall be no septic systems, permanent
structures or impervious cover, with the
exception of paths, within the outer zone.

D. Design Standard For Streamside
Management Buffer.
1. Design Standards for Streamside Management
Buffer.
a. A streamside management buffer for a stream
system shall consist preferably of a dense, native,
deep-rooted, ground-plain vegetation along with
open grown large, overstory forest trees planted
no closer than 40 feet on center of land extending
along both sides of a stream and its adjacent
wetlands, floodways or slopes. The streamside
management buffer width shall be adjusted to
include contiguous sensitive areas, such as steep
slopes or erodible soils, where development or
disturbance may adversely affect water quality,
streams, wetlands or other water bodies.
b. The streamside management buffer shall begin at
the top edge of the stream bank.
c. The required width for all streamside management
buffer(s) (i.e., the base buffer width) encompassing
both Zone 1 and Zone 2 as more fully described
below shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet,
with the requirement to expand the streamside
management buffer depending on stream order,
size of drainage basin, percent slope, floodway, and
wetlands or critical area considerations as provided
for in this Article.
d. In third order and higher streams, add twenty-five
(25) feet to the base buffer width.
e. Streamside management buffer width shall be
modified to account for steep slopes. If the average
percent slope within the baseline fifty (50) foot
buffer is fifteen (15) percent or above, an additional
buffer width in Zone 1, as described in Table
12.D-1, shall apply. In those cases, the streamside
management buffer width will be adjusted in
accordance with Table 12.D-1 below.
f. Streamside management buffers shall be extended
to encompass the entire floodway and a buffer with
a minimum of fifty (50) feet beyond the edge of
the floodway.
g. Streamside management buffers shall be modified
to account for the size of the drainage basin the
stream is serving. An additional buffer width in
Zone 1 (in addition to that prescribed in Table
12.D-1 below), as described in Table 12.D-2
below, shall apply. In those cases, the streamside
management buffer will be adjusted in accordance
with Table 12.D-2 below. The additional buffer
width required in Table 12.D-2 may be combined
with the additional buffer width requirements
contained in Table 12.D-1 upon approval by the
City Engineer.
h. When wetland or critical areas extend beyond
the edge of the required streamside management
buffer width, the streamside management buffer
shall be adjusted so that the buffer consists of the
extent of the wetland plus a twenty-five (25) foot
buffer extending beyond the wetland edge.
2. Water Pollution Hazards. The following land uses
and/or activities are designated as potential water
pollution hazards, and must be set back in addition to
the streamside management buffer base width from
any stream or water body by the distance indicated
below:
a. Storage of hazardous substances - (500 feet)
b. Above ground or underground petroleum storage
facilities - (500 feet)
c. Drainfields from onsite sewage disposal and
treatment systems (i.e. septic systems)  (250 feet)
d. Raised septic systems - (250 feet)
e. Solid waste landfills or junkyards  (500 feet)
f. Confined animal feedlot operations - (500 feet)
g. Subsurface discharges from a wastewater treatment
plant - (250 feet)

E. Streamside Management and
Maintenance
1. Management Practices in Streamside Management
Buffer.
a. The streamside management buffer, including
wetlands and floodways, shall be managed to
enhance and maximize the unique value of these
resources. Management includes specific limitations
on alteration of the natural conditions of these
resources. The following practices and activities are
restricted within Zones 1 and 2 of the SMB, except
with approval by the Planning Commission:
i. Clearing of existing vegetation except for
clearing, cutting, or prescribed burning
associated with an approved buffer management
plan or practice and/or at the recommendation
or approval of the Natural Resources Director.
Where prescribed burning of the buffer
vegetation is not allowed and/or not feasible,
annual cutting shall be performed.
ii. Soil disturbance by grading, stripping, or other
practices
iii. Filling or dumping
iv. Drainage by ditching, underdrains, or other
systems

that no economically feasible alternative is
available.
2. The right-of-way should be the minimum
width needed to allow for maintenance
access and installation.
3. The angle of the crossing shall be
perpendicular to the streamside
management buffer in order to minimize
clearing requirements.
4. The minimum number of road crossings
should be used within each subdivision,
and no more than one roadway crossing
is allowed for every one thousand (1,000)
linear feet of streamside management buffer
running parallel with the stream channel.
ii. Stormwater management:
1. An analysis needs to be conducted to ensure
that no economically feasible alternative
is available and that the project is either
necessary for flood control, or significantly
improves the water quality or habitat in the
stream.
2. In new developments, onsite and
nonstructural alternatives will be preferred
over larger facilities within the SMB.
3. When constructing stormwater
management facilities (i.e., BMPs), the area
cleared will be limited to the area required
for construction and adequate maintenance
access.
4. Material dredged or otherwise removed
from a BMP shall be stored outside the
SMB.
5. Where the Streamside Management Buffer
is greater than five (5) percent slope,
concentrated stormwater discharges shall
discharge directly to the water body and
energy dissipation shall be provided to
prevent scour, using techniques approved by
the City Engineer.
6. Where the Streamside Management Buffer
is less than or equal to five (5) percent slope,
concentrated stormwater discharges shall
be allowed to be directed to the Streamside
Management Buffer Zone 2 Outer Section
provided that the energy of the discharge
shall be dissipated using trench level
spreaders or other measures approved by
the City Engineer. Trench level spreaders
shall be constructed on the contour and
the peak discharge rates through the level
spreader shall not exceed 0.01 to 0.02
cubic feet per second (cfs) per foot of level
spreader.

management, water quality, and habitat
benefits).
iii. Stream restoration projects, facilities and
activities approved by the City Engineer, and
Planning Commission are permitted within the
SMB.
iv. Water quality monitoring and stream
gauging are permitted within the streamside
management buffer, as approved by City
Engineer or Natural Resource Director.
v. Prescribed burning shall be allowed within
the streamside management buffer as part of
an approved buffer management plan or upon
approval by the Natural Resources Director.
Applicant or property owner is responsible for
obtaining any required County permits and
notifying the appropriate authorities before
burns are conducted.
2. Maintenance of Streamside Management Buffer
a. Individual trees within the SMB in danger of
falling, causing damage to dwellings or other
structures, or causing blockage of the stream
may be removed upon approval by the Natural
Resource Director or City Engineer.
b. Other timber cutting techniques approved by the
City and/or State of Tennessee may be undertaken
within the SMB under the advice and guidance
of City and/or State of Tennessee if necessary to
preserve the forest from extensive pest infestation,
disease infestation, or threat from fire.
c. In order to support the establishment of an
adequate layer of ground-plain vegetation, the
forest canopy may be thinned to reduce groundplain
shading (to as little as 50% canopy cover) as
part of an approved buffer management plan or
upon approval by the Natural Resources Director.
F. Plan Requirements and Administration.
1. Plan requirement. In accordance with Section A of
this Article, a plan approved by the City Engineer and
Planning Commission is required for all development,

regarding the presence and location of protective
covenants for streamside management buffer and
shall contain information on the management
and maintenance requirements for the streamside
management buffer for the new property owner.
b. An offer of dedication of a streamside management
buffer to the City shall not be interpreted to mean
that this automatically conveys to the general
public the right of access to this area.
9. Annual inspection of streamside management
buffers. The City may inspect established streamside
management buffers annually for evidence of
sediment deposition, erosion, or concentrated flow
channels and corrective actions taken to ensure
the integrity and functions of the streamside
management buffer.
10. Successional growth in streamside management
buffer allowed. Streamside Management Buffers may
be allowed to grow into their vegetative target state
naturally, but methods to enhance the successional
process such as active reforestation, selective forest
thinning, or prescribed burning may be used when
deemed necessary and appropriate by the Natural
Resource Director and City Engineer to ensure the
preservation and propagation of the streamside
management buffer. Streamside Management Buffers
may also be enhanced through reforestation or
other growth techniques as a form of mitigation for
achieving preservation requirements.
G. Exceptions and Variances.
1. Exceptions
a. This Article shall apply to all proposed
development except for activities that were
completed prior to the effective date of this Article
and had received the following:
i. A valid, unexpired permit in accordance with
development regulations;
ii. A current, executed public works agreement;
iii. A valid, unexpired building permit; or
iv. A waiver in accordance with current
development regulations.

Existing nonconforming buildings and uses
may be continued but the existing building
footprint or use shall not be expanded or
enlarged unless approved by the Planning
Commission. Discontinued nonconforming
uses may be resumed within one (1) year
from such discontinuance but not thereafter
unless approved by the Planning Commission,
provided, however, that no change or
resumption of use shall be more detrimental
to any streamside management buffer than
the existing or former nonconforming use, as
measured against the intent and objectives of
this Article.
c. This Article shall not apply to agricultural
operations that are covered by approved BMPs
as defined by the Tennessee Department of
Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Livestock operations are subject to limited
application of this Article relative to the protection
of Streamside Management Buffer from significant
degradation of the stream system and accelerated
streambank erosion from livestock.
2. Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a
variance for the following:
a. Those projects or activities for which it can be
demonstrated that strict compliance with the
ordinance would result in a practical difficulty;
b. The requirements of the SMB represent an extreme
hardship for the landowner such that little or no
reasonable economic use of the land is available
without reducing the width of the SMB;
323
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 12 - Streamside Management Buffers
c. The size, shape or topography of the property, as
of the effective date of this Article, is such that it is
not possible to construct a single-family dwelling
without encroaching upon the SMB;

g. The repair and maintenance of public
improvements where avoidance and minimization
of adverse impacts to associated aquatic ecosystems
have been addressed; or
h. Those developments which have had buffers or
conservation easements applied in conformance
with previously issued requirements.
3. Variance from required streamside management
buffer width. Variances from required streamside
management buffer widths for development may also
be granted, if deemed appropriate by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, provided, however, the streamside
management buffer width may be reduced at some
points as long as the average width of the streamside
management buffer meets the minimum requirement.
This averaging of the streamside management
buffer may be used to allow for the presence of an
existing structure or to recover a lost lot, as long as
the streamside management buffer (Zone I) is not
disturbed or encroached upon and no new structures
are built within the one hundred (100)-year floodplain
unless otherwise permitted by the Floodway
regulations contained in the Zoning Ordinance. Under
no circumstance shall the streamside management
buffer be less than twenty-five (25) feet (the buffer
required for Zone 1).
4. Application for variance required. The applicant shall
submit a written request for a variance to the Board
of Zoning Appeals at least thirty (30) days prior to the
hearing. The application shall include specific reasons
justifying the variance and any other information
necessary to evaluate the proposed variance request.
The Board may require an alternative analysis
that clearly demonstrates that no other feasible
alternatives exist and that minimal impact will occur as
a result of the project or development. Each applicant
for a variance must provide documentation that
describes in detail:
a. Existing site conditions, including the status of the
protected area; and
b. The needs and purpose for the proposed project;
and
c. Justification for seeking a variance, including how
buffer encroachment will be minimized to the
greatest extent possible; and
d. A proposed mitigation plan that offsets the
effects of the proposed encroachment during site
preparation, construction and post-construction
phases.
5. Requirements from Board of Zoning Appeals. In
granting a request for a variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require site design, landscape planting,
fencing, signs, and water quality best management
practices to reduce adverse impacts on water quality,
streams, wetlands, floodways and floodplains. All
landscape, fencing and signage plans shall be subject
to applicable review and approval via subdivision and/
or zoning processes defined in Article I, as determined
by the Code Administrator.
6. Conditions for granting a variance. Any variance
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals will meet, at
a minimum, the following conditions:
a. The width of the SMB is reduced only by the
minimum extent necessary to provide relief; and
b. Land disturbing activities must comply with
the requirements of the Erosion and Sediment
Control Ordinance of the City of Lakeland and
all applicable best management practices. Such
activities shall not impair water quality, as defined
by the federal Clean Water Act and the rules
governing water quality of the State of Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation;
and
c. As an additional condition of issuing the variance,
the Board of Zoning Appeals may require water
quality monitoring downstream from the site of

the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final.
H. Enforcement.
In addition to any other enforcement right provided herein,
the City may bring civil action to restrain a violator from
proceeding with any development or land disturbance
pending the completion of the proceedings provided in this
Article, to restrain the violator from violating any provision
of this Article and to require the violator to restore at his/her
expense any damage to the Streamside Management Buffer
which he/she caused. The violator shall be liable to the City
for all costs, including attorney fees, which the City may
324
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 12 - Streamside Management Buffers
incur in bringing such an action. Alternatively, the City may
seek damages from the violator in the amount necessary
to repair any damage to the Streamside Management
Buffer and may also recover any costs and its attorney fees
incurred in obtaining a recovery of damages.
I. Severability.
Should any section, subsection, clause, or provision of this
Article be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this
Article in whole or any part thereof other than the part so
declared to be invalid.
325
III. Zoning Regulations
Section 13 - Site Lighting Requirements
A. Intent and Purpose
It is the intent of this Chapter to encourage lighting
practices and systems that will minimize light pollution,
glare, light trespass; conserve energy and resources
while maintaining night-time safety, utility, security and
productivity; and curtail the degradation of the night
time visual environment. The purpose of this section is
to establish regulations to allow for outdoor illumination
levels that are appropriate for the visual task, safety and
security while minimizing the undesirable side effects of
excessive illumination such as glare, sky glow and light
pollution. Over time, it is the intent that this section
will allow for reasonably uniform illumination levels in
the community. It is also the purpose of this section to
establish design criteria for outdoor lighting fixtures that
will enhance the visual and aesthetic character of the City
of Lakeland.
B. Applicability
1. New Uses. All proposed new land uses,
developments, buildings, structures, or building
additions of twenty-five percent (25%) or more in
terms of additional dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement
specified herein, either with a single addition or
cumulative additions subsequent to the effective date
of this provision, shall meet the requirements of
this Chapter for the entire property. This includes
additions which increase the total number of required
parking spaces by twenty-five percent (25%) or more.
For all building additions of less than twenty-five
percent (25%) cumulative, the applicant shall only
have to meet the requirements of this Chapter for
any new outdoor lighting provided.
2. Change in Use/Intensity  Whenever the use of
any existing building, structure, premises is changed
to a new use, or the intensity of use is increased
through the incorporation of additional dwelling
units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other
units of measurement specified herein, and which
change in use or intensification of use creates a
need for increase in the total number of required
parking spaces of twenty-five percent (25%) or more,
either with a single change or cumulative changes
subsequent to the effective date of these provisions,
then all outdoor lighting facilities shall meet the
requirements of this Chapter for the entire property.
For changes of use or intensity which require an
increase in parking of less than twenty-five percent
(25%) cumulative, the applicant shall only have to
meet the requirements of this Chapter for any new
outdoor lighting provided.
C. Definitions
The following words and terms related to outdoor lighting
are defined as follows:
Direct Illumination. Illumination resulting from light
emitted directly from a lamp, luminary, or reflector
and is not light diffused through translucent signs or
reflected from other surfaces such as the ground or
building faces.
Foot Candle. A unit of measure for luminance. A unit of
luminance on a surface that is everywhere one foot
from a uniform point source of light of one candle
and equal to one lumen per square foot.
Full Cut-Off Type Fixture. A luminaire or light fixture that
by design of the housing does not allow any light
dispersion or direct glare to shine above 90 degrees,
horizontal plane from the base of the fixture.
Fully-shielded Light Fixture. A light fixture that is shielded
in such a manner that light rays emitted by the
fixture, either directly from the lamp or indirectly
from the fixture, are projected below a horizontal
plane running through the lowest point on the fixture
where light is emitted.
Glare. The sensation produced by lighting that causes an
annoyance, loss in visual performance and visibility
to the eye. The magnitude of glare depends on such
factors as the size, position, brightness of the source,
and on the brightness level to which the eyes are
adapted.
Horizontal Luminance. The measure of brightness from
a light source, usually measured in foot candles or
lumens, which is taken through a light meters sensor
at a horizontal position.
Illuminance. The quantity of light measured in foot
candles or lux.
Light Trespass. Light from an artificial light source that
is intruding beyond the boundaries of the property
upon which the lighting is intended to serve.
Lumen. Unit used to measure the actual amount of visible
light which is produced by a lamp as specified by the
manufacturer.
Luminaire. A complete lighting unit, including a lamp or
lamps together with the parts designed to distribute
the light, to position and protect the lamps, and to
connect the lamps to the power supply.

parking lot luminaires) and light fixtures installed on
the sides of buildings or other structures, when not
shielded from above the structure itself as defined
in subsections 2 and 3 below, are to be included in
the total outdoor light output by simply adding the
lumen outputs of the lamps used;
2. Outdoor light fixtures installed under canopies,
building overhangs, or roof eaves where the center
of the lamp or luminaire is located at least five (5)
feet but less than ten (10) feet from the nearest edge
of the canopy or overhang are to be included in the
total outdoor light output as though they produced
only one-quarter (1/4) of the lamps rated lumen
output;
3. Outdoor light fixtures located under the canopy
and ten (10) or more feet from the nearest edge of a
canopy, building overhang, or eave are to be included
in the total outdoor light output as though they
produced only one-tenth (1/10) of the lamps rated

be equivalent to or greater than two hundred (200)
feet or two hundred percent (200%) of the height of
the tower, whichever is greater; provided, however,
in the case of self-supporting lattice or guyed towers
the minimum distance from the base of the tower to
any right-of-way and adjoining property line shall
be equivalent to or greater than two hundred fifty
(250) feet or three hundred percent (300%) of the
height of the tower, whichever is greater. Guys
shall be placed no closer than seventy-five (75) feet
from a right-of-way or adjoining property line. No
buildings or structures shall be located within the
setback area of any required yard, thereby providing
a clear fall zone for the tower to any right-of-way
and adjoining property line. The setbacks for all
associated appurtenances, including buildings,
cabinets, structures and facilities, shall correspond
with the minimum setback requirements established
for the zoning district in which the use is proposed.
2. Separation Distance Between Towers. Separation
distances between towers shall be applicable for and
measured between the proposed tower and preexisting
towers. The separation distances shall be

within existing power transmission line towers, shall
be encouraged whenever possible.
a. The applicants proposal for a new wireless
transmission facility shall not be approved unless
it can be documented by the applicant that the
proposed equipment planned for the proposed
tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or
approved tower located within a minimum distance
of ten hundredths (.10) miles due to one or more
of the following reasons:
(1) The planned equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of existing and approved
towers, considering existing and planned
use of those towers cannot be reinforced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment
at a reasonable cost.
(2) The planned equipment would cause radio
frequency (FR) interference with other existing
or planned equipment for these towers, and
the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
(3) Existing or approved towers do not
have space on which planned equipment
can be placed so it can function effectively
and reasonably in parity with other similar
equipment in place or approved.
(4) Geographic service requirements.
b. The applicant shall also address the extent to
which shared use of the proposed tower will
be allowed in the future. A letter of intent
committing the tower owner and his successors
to allow shared use of the tower, if an applicant
agrees in writing to pay any reasonable charge for
shared use, shall be filed with the City, prior to any
building permit being issued.

equipment buildings, located in or abutting property
zoned residential (either immediately adjacent to
such property or across a public roadway), special
care shall be taken to minimize the effects on the
adjacent residential area. The following shall be
considered minimum standards:
a.A minimum of fifty (50)-foot buffer strip shall be
required on the outer perimeter of the property,
abutting property currently zoned for residential,
office or commercial use or development. No
internal roads or driveways, parking areas,
structures or storage of materials shall be allowed
within the buffer strip. This standard shall not
supersede any existing or future agreements or
regulations which may provide for a greater buffer
strip than outlined in subsection K.1. of this
Section.
b. The buffer strip shall consist of plantings and
physical features sufficient to screen the view
beginning at a specified level, reduce glare and
noise, and provide greater privacy for nearby
residential uses. The buffer shall be initially
installed for the permanent year-round protection
of adjacent property by visually shielding internal
activities from adjoining property from ground
level view to a minimum height of six (6) feet. A
landscaping plan detailing the type, substance,
design, width, height, opacity, growing period
to maturity, time schedule for installation, and
responsibility for perpetual maintenance of the
buffer strip shall be submitted to the Design
Review Commission for consideration of a
recommendation.
c. The landscaping provisions of this Section may be
varied or reduced if the proposed plan provides for
unique and innovative landscaping treatment or
physical features that, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, meet the intent and purpose of this
Section. In instances where significant physical
features exist (i.e., railroads, major roads and
interstates, hillsides, preserved wooded areas, and
utility easements, etc.) which in the opinion of the
Planning Commission provided adequate buffering
between land uses, the existing buffers may be
used to meet landscaping requirements of this
Section.
d. Security fencing shall be required and shall comply
with the regulations set forth in Article III, Section
5(Q) of this Code for fencing. Security fencing
(wood only) shall be required around the area of

requested by the user, in compliance with the
Fence Regulations contained in this code shall
be constructed, in addition to, and behind the
required wood fencing.
e. Wireless transmission facilities mounted on a
building or structure in a commercial district shall
be screened and/or designed to blend in visually
with the roof and/or structure and surroundings
where mounted. Such methods and materials shall
only require approval by the Planning Commission
with a recommendation from the Design Review
Commission.
f. Prior to issuance of a building permit, security
acceptable to the City (such as a maintenance
bond, letter of credit or similar security) shall
be required to ensure completion of landscaping
and screening provisions as outlined in the plan
approved by the Planning Commission. The
security shall be posted in an amount equal to
one hundred ten percent (110%) of the total
cost of the materials and installation of such
improvements. This security shall be required for
a period of one (1) year following the issuance of
a Certificate of for the building, or one (1) year
following the completion of construction of the
wireless transmission facility if no Certificate of
Completion is required.
2. Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other
Structures, or Alternative Technology. No new tower
shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning
Commission that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology that does not require the use of
towers or structures can accommodate the applicants
proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit
information requested by the Planning Commission
related to the availability of suitable existing towers,
other structures or alternative technology. Evidence
submitted to demonstrate at no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology can accommodate

Section 2 - Traffic Impact Study
A. Traffic Impact Study.
1. Completed by a Professional. Traffic impact studies
shall be conducted and signed by a Tennessee
registered professional engineer experienced in
traffic engineering.
2. Applicability. An Applicant shall undertake a traffic
impact study as part of the land development
application (refer to I.4 Process Criteria and
Application) completed for developments resulting
in more than 75 new peak hour vehicle trips on
the adjacent street. A traffic impact study may
be required for developments generating less
than 75 new peak hour trips when the site plan
indicates the need, when the traffic from the site
would impact a local problem area (high crash
location, congested area, etc), or when determined
by the City Engineer. Examples of the types of
development that would generate more than 75
new peak hour trips on the adjacent street would
include the following.
a. More than sixty-nine (69) single-family
residential lots or units.
b. Seven thousand (4,500) square feet of shopping
center (gross leasable area).
c. Sixty-seven thousand (50,000) square feet of
general office (gross floor area).
3. Traffic Engineer. When traffic studies are warranted
a fee shall be paid to the City for the cost of the
study prepared by an independent traffic engineer.
This fee will be due and paid in full from the
developer to the City prior to the traffic engineer
beginning work for the City.
a. The traffic engineer shall be selected by the
City and shall work directly for the City in the
preparation of the study.
b. The traffic engineer will use the scope of
services adopted by the City.
c. The City will utilize the services of the traffic
engineer to review traffic issues relating to the
development.
d. The traffic engineer shall provide the City a
negotiated fee to cover the costs associated
with traffic studies on each development.
4. Study Components. All traffic impact studies shall
be prepared to contain the following information
about the site and the project. The City Engineer
shall have the authority to request the evaluation or
addition of further information, if a more extensive
analysis is warranted.
a. Proposed Development.
(1) Description of development including
the study area, project location, off-site or
background development in the project
vicinity, proposed land use/ zoning and
intensity (number of dwelling units, square
footage, etc.), project phasing and timing,
and proposed site plan.
(2) Identification of project opening date, date
of full build out, and horizon year for traffic
analysis. Typical study horizon years will
be opening day, date of full build out and
occupancy (if it is not the same as opening
day), and five years after full build out
and occupancy. If a project is expected to
generate more than 1000 peak hour trips and
if the proposed development will produce
more trips than the land use contained in
the City of Lakeland adopted Land Use Plan,
then the study horizon year will be the same
year as the horizon year of the Metropolitan
Planning Organizations Long Range
Transportation Plan.
b. Existing Conditions.
(1) Identification of existing land uses and
zoning of the subject property and of
adjacent properties;
(2) Identification of nearby properties that have
been identified for redevelopment or that
have approved plans for redevelopment;
(3) Identification of the existing and future
roadway system in the vicinity of the project.
Include existing and future laneage, and
existing traffic control
(4) Documentation of existing traffic volumes
and operations. Turning movement counts
are to be provided for the peak hours of
operation of the proposed development
and the peak hours of traffic for the adjacent
street. Depending on the proposed use,
weekend counts may be required.
(5) Documentation of existing transportation
alternatives (bike, pedestrian, transit,
transportation system management
programs)
c. Projected Traffic
(1) Site traffic
1. Identify trip generation rates utilized.
All trip generation rates are to be in
accordance with the latest edition of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
Trip Generation Manual, unless otherwise
approved by the Engineer.
2. Documentation of trip distribution
methodology and diagram of proposed
distribution.
Land Development Regulations 353
FINAL DRAFT January 2013
IV. Appendix
3. Identify modal splits used for the proposed
development.
4. Documentation and diagram of trip
assignments.
5. Internally captured trips are to be
determined based on methods included
in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook (most
recent edition).
(2) Non-Site Traffic
1.Identify current year traffic volumes
2. Document methodology for projecting
non-site traffic to the study horizon year.
3. Document anticipated non-site traffic due
to approved or planned area developments,
including methodology for determining trips
generated, trip distribution, modal split, and
trip assignment.
4. Determine estimated volume of total nonsite
traffic.
5. Determine appropriate percentage of passby
trips based on methods included in the
ITE Trip Generation Handbook (most recent
edition).
(3) Total Traffic  Determine the total traffic for
each horizon year, including both site and
non-site traffic.
d. Analyses
(1) Site Access  determine number, type, and
location of site access points. Location and
type of access points should also consider
other roads and access points in the vicinity
of the proposed project.
(2) Determine limits of analyses  The study
boundaries and limits of analysis will be
determined based on the number of peak
hour trips expected to be generated by
the proposed development. The following
guidelines will be used unless otherwise
determined by the City Engineer:
 Less than 200 Peak Hour Trips  Adjacent
intersections (if corner location) and within
1000 feet of all access points
 Between 200 and 500 Peak Hour Trips  all
signalized intersections within ½ mile of the
Section 2 - Traffic Impact Study
property lines of the site and all unsignalized
intersections within ¼ mile of the site.
 Greater than 500 Peak Hour Trips  all
signalized and unsignalized intersections
within1 mile of site property lines.
(3) Capacity and Level of Service  determine
the capacity and level of service of the
roadways and intersections within the study
boundaries for the following conditions:
1. Existing Conditions
2. Background Conditions  existing traffic
plus growth to each horizon year
3. Total Traffic Conditions  existing plus
background plus site total traffic for each
horizon year.
(4) Provide an assessment of the safety issues for
the development
(5) Provide an assessment of site circulation and
parking
e. Improvement Analyses  conduct analyses of
the conditions listed below to determine the
improvements required due to the proposed
development, if any. For these analyses,
Level-of-Service D or better is considered
to be acceptable for intersection analyses.
Improvements shall also consider multi-modal
improvements such as pedestrian paths, bicycle
routes, or transit. Multi-modal improvements
shall comply with the Lakeland Comprehensive
Plan.
(1) Improvements to accommodate existing
traffic  if the existing conditions analyses
reveals intersections or roadway segments
that will operate at an unacceptable Level-of-
Service (LOS), determine the improvements
required for those intersections or roadway
segments to operate at an acceptable LOS.
(2) Improvements to accommodate background
traffic  conduct analyses of the background
traffic for each horizon year to determine
if any of the intersections or roadway
segments within the study area will
operate at an unacceptable LOS and, if
so, the improvements required for these
intersections or roadway segments to
operate at an acceptable LOS.
(3) Total Traffic  conduct analyses of the
total traffic for each horizon year to
determine if any of the intersections or
354
IV. Appendix
roadway segments within the study area
will operate at an unacceptable LOS, and
if so, the improvements required for these
intersections or roadway segments to
operate at an acceptable LOS.
Analyses should clearly indicate the
improvements required due to the proposed
development. The analyses shall include
a determination of any changes to traffic
control devices that may be required for the
proposed development, including traffic
signals. If there are improvements that are
already planned or programmed within
the study area, the study shall document
the status of those improvements and the
schedule of those improvements relative to
the horizon years of this study.
f. Recommendations and Summary  provide
a summary of the assumptions and analyses
contained above and a list of recommended
improvements required to accommodate the
proposed development. These improvements
may contain recommendations for road
improvements, changes to intersection traffic
control, intersection improvements, or multimodal
improvements.
g. Appendices  provide copies of all traffic counts,
worksheets, analyses, or other items used to
prepare this study.

should be indicated for removal, including hazard trees, damaged or dying trees, and invasive
species shall not achieve credit. Also, for trees under 10 dbh, no credit shall be achieved.
For trees from 10  13.9 dbh occurring within a 100 linear segment along the scenic corridor,
10% of the minimum planting level required for large or medium overstory trees in that segment
is achieved for each tree of this size.
For trees from 14  19.9 dbh occurring within a 100 linear segment along the scenic corridor,
20% of the minimum planting level required for large or medium overstory trees in that segment
is achieved for each tree of this size.
For trees from 20  25.9 dbh occurring within a 100 linear segment along the scenic corridor,
30% of the minimum planting level required for large or medium overstory trees in that segment
is achieved for each tree of this size.
For trees from 26  33.9 dbh occurring within a 100 linear segment along the scenic corridor,
40% of the minimum planting level required for large or medium overstory trees in that segment
is achieved for each tree of this size.

hazardous tree within the time specified in the
written notice from the city, such failure shall
constitute a violation of this division and shall
be punishable in accordance with State Law and
the provisions of this ordinance.
(v) If the responsible party fails to remove a
hazardous tree within the time specified in
the written notice from the city, and if the city
determines that the hazardous tree constitutes
an imminent threat to the property of others or
to the general public or could result in damage
to overhead lines or obstruction of streets,
the city shall have the right to enter upon the
property and remove the tree, and all costs
incurred by the city in such regard shall be due
and payable from the responsible party to the
city upon demand, and, if not paid, the city

To hear and decide applications for variance from
the terms of this Ordinance, but only where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of specific piece of property which at the time
of adoption of this Ordinance was a lot of record;
or where, by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions, physiographic conditions, soil physiology,
or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or
conditions of a piece of property the strict application
of the provisions of the Ordinance would result
in exceptional difficulties or the exceptional and
undue hardship upon the owner of such property,
provided that such relief may be granted without
the substantial detriment to the public and without
substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this
Ordinance. Financial disadvantage to the property
owner is no proof of hardship within the purpose
of this ordinance and as further explained below.
The Board shall not grant a variance unless it makes
findings based upon evidence presented to it as
follows:
a. Physical or topographical conditions - The particular
physical surroundings, shape, or topographic
conditions of the specific property involved would
result in a particular hardship upon the owner as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict application of this Ordinance were carried out.
b. Relationship to other properties within the district -
The conditions upon which the petition for variance
is based would not be applicable, generally, to
other property within the same district.
c. Permitted activity - The variance will not authorize
activities in a zoning district other than those
permitted by this Ordinance.
d. Financial implications - The variance is not based
solely on financial returns.
e. Self-created hardship - The alleged difficulty or
hardship has not been created by any person
having an interest in the property after the effective
date of this Ordinance.
f. Special privilege - Granting the variance will not
confer on this applicant any special privilege that is
denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures,
or building in the same district.
g. Minimum variance required - The variance is the
minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
h. Effect on public welfare - Granting the variance will
not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
to other property or improvements in the area in
which property is located.
