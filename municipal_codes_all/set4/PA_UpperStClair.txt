to bring the provisions into conformity with the desired policies of the Board of Commissioners,

Code as if the ordinances so changed had been previously formally amended to read as such. All

established for the proper and efficient conduct of municipal affairs. The purpose of these boards
is to perform duties of a continuing nature in specific areas as designated by this Administrative
Code, the Home Rule Charter or other ordinances of the township.
§ 15.2. Establishment of administrative boards; authority.
15.2.1. The boards designated in the following Articles have been previously
established by ordinance or are established by this Administrative Code. Additional boards shall,

performed by one (1) or more of the existing boards.
§ 15 BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS § 15
15-5
15.2.2. Those boards specified as being administrative boards in this
Administrative Code have been or are hereby established within the requirements of the statutes
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the laws of the Township of Upper St. Clair. Those
boards designated as administrative boards shall have authority only in the specific areas of
responsibility granted to such boards by the statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by
this Administrative Code, by the Home Rule Charter or by other ordinances of the township.
§ 15.3. Expenditure of public funds; contracts.3
No administrative board shall have the authority to spend township funds unless provided
for in the budget, specifically approved by the Board of Commissioners and subsequently
approved by the Township Manager or a member of the administrative staff authorized so to do
by the Manager. The Manager shall assign employees of the township to serve as liaison to and
provide staff services to the boards. No administrative board shall have the power to enter into

to the expiration of his appointed term by a majority vote of the Board of Commissioners or in
accordance with the laws of the commonwealth applicable to such board.
15.4.3. Compensation. No member of any administrative board shall be
compensated for his duties.
15.4.4. Indemnification. [Added 2-1-82 by Ord. No. 986]
15.4.4.1. Each member shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with any adverse action by reason of the fact that he is or was a
member if the member acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
best interests of the township and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the member did not act in good faith and

respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct
was unlawful.
15.4.4.2. To the extent that the member has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any adverse action, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith as of right. In all
other instances, indemnification should be made by the township only as authorized in a specific
case upon a determination that the indemnification of the member is proper in the circumstances
because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth above. Such determination shall
be made by the Board of Commissioners.
15.4.4.3. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding shall be paid by the township in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Commissioners in a specific case upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the member to repay such an amount unless it shall ultimately be
determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the township as provided herein.
15.4.4.4. The indemnification provided by this subsection shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled by
any contract or as a matter of law.
15.4.4.5. The indemnification shall continue as to such person who has
ceased to be a member and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of

stating his reasons therefor.

GENERAL REFERENCES
Definitions and rules of interpretation - See Ch. 3.
Personnel system - See Ch. 33.
§ 23.1. Statement of principles.
The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct
themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed. The people have a right to expect
that every public official and employee will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to
preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents. Such confidence and
respect can best be promoted if every public official and employee, whether paid or unpaid and
whether elected or appointed, will uniformly:
23.1.1. Treat all citizens with impartiality, fairness and equality under the law.
23.1.2. Avoid both actual and potential conflicts between his private self-interest
and the public interest.
§ 23.2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
§ 23 UPPER ST CLAIR CODE § 23

monetary or other material benefit to the official or employee or to any person employing
or retaining the services of the official or employee. "Financial interest" shall not include
cases where the official or employee is a party to or is associated with a party to a
transaction with the township when such official or employee has no possible influence
in the transaction.
OFFICIAL or EMPLOYEE - Any person elected or appointed to, or employed or
retained by, any public office or public body of the township, whether paid or unpaid and

from close business association, whether or not any financial interest is involved.

23.4.2. Disclosure and disqualification. All officials and employees shall, upon
taking office, file a disclosure statement of all areas of financial interest or personal interest as
hereinafter set forth in § 23.7. Whenever the performance of his official duties shall require any
official or employee to deliberate and vote on any matter involving his financial or personal
interest, he shall publicly disclose the nature and extent of such interest and disqualify himself
from participating in the deliberation as well as in the voting.
§ 23 ETHICS, CODE OF § 23

employment with or render services for any party in connection with any transaction with any
public body. Except where authorized by law, no official or employee shall hold any other

present office, and no former official or employee shall hold any appointive compensated
position as an official or employee until one (1) year after the expiration of the term for which he
was elected or appointed. No official or employee shall be prohibited, under this subsection,
from serving on any public body or on any intergovernmental agency or council of government
which would be in furtherance of his duties and responsibilities as an official or employee, but
no additional pay shall be received for any such services. This subsection shall not prohibit the
Township Manager from serving as the Township Secretary simultaneously.

appear on behalf of any private person, other than himself, before any public body.

be considered a gift or favor.

relative-in-law.
23.4.8. Service as attorney. No official or employee shall serve as attorney for a

permitted to serve a party in any matter in which the township is an adverse party or has an
adverse interest during his tenure and for at least one (1) year subsequent to his retirement,
resignation or removal as Township Attorney, but nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of
Commissioners from appointing the succeeding Township Attorney from the same firm.
23.4.10. Purchases or sales by official or employee. No official or employee shall
be a purchaser in any sale involving the township; nor shall an official or employee be a vendor,

negotiated collective bargaining agreements or individual employee agreements. The
2Editor’s Note: See Ch. 15, Boards and Commissions, Art. III.
3Editor’s Note: For provisions pertaining generally to public access to township records and the
preservation of records, see Ch. 11, Administrative General Provisions §§ 11.6 and 11.7.
§ 33 PERSONNEL SYSTEM § 33
33-5
accumulated annual vacation leave must be taken within a one-year period following the year in
which it was earned. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable collective bargaining
agreement, vacation leave may be taken in advance with the prior approval of the department
head and Township Manager, but shall be limited to not more than one (1) week; provided that
upon termination of employment of an employee, any vacation leave taken by such employee but
not earned shall be deducted from the final paycheck. Employees will not be paid for vacation
leave in lieu of taking such vacation leave, except under the provisions established for
termination. The vacation leave year for each employee is established in accordance with their
employment anniversary date. If an employee, while on vacation leave, is hospitalized or
becomes sick, their vacation leave may be charged to sick leave, if documented by a physician's
certificate.
33.8.2. Sick Leave. [Amended 7-5-88 by Ord. No. 1335] Regular full-time
employees are entitled to sick leave, to be earned annually and to be accumulated in accordance
with negotiated collective bargaining agreements or individual employee agreements.
Presentation of a certificate from a physician is required for paid sick leave extending beyond
three (3) consecutive working days unless otherwise provided in an applicable collective
bargaining agreement. In cases where absence due to illness is frequent but such days of absence
are not necessarily consecutive, an employee may be required to present a physician's certificate
substantiating such illness, from their personal physician or from a physician designated by the
Township, by request of the Department Head and the Township Manager. If a medical
certificate satisfactory to the Department Head and Township Manager is not provided, the sick
leave will be charged to vacation leave or to unpaid leave, and the employee may be subject to
further disciplinary action. Sick leave will not be granted for any reason other than illness or
injury. Abuse of sick leave privileges will subject employees to disciplinary action.
The above limitations may be waived under certain unusual circumstances and with the
approval of the Township Manager.
Employees must exhaust their sick leave prior to utilizing the sickness and accident
benefits and/or long term disability benefits provided under contracts or individual employment
agreements.
Extended sick leave, without pay, may be granted at the discretion of the Township
Manager upon presentation of a physician's certificate, which shall include the expected duration
of leave. Said leave shall be for a period not to exceed one (1) year after all applicable sick leave
and disability benefits have been exhausted. When the employee's physician certifies that the
employee is able to return to work and if it is not possible for the township to restore the
employee to his or her former position, the employee will be offered any available position
suitable to his or her skills, training or ability, in the discretion of the Township Manager, unless
circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to reemploy the
employee. If an employee does not notify the Township of the expected return date, or if the
§ 33 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 33
33-6
employee does not contact the township regarding return to work at the conclusion of the sick
leave, this will be deemed a voluntary resignation. 4
33.8.3. Emergency Leave. [Amended 7-5-88 by Ord. No. 1335] Regular fulltime
employees may receive leave with pay for catastrophic accidents or serious illness in the
immediate family for a period of time not to exceed five (5) consecutive days. Emergency leave
must be approved by the Township Manager prior to taking said leave.
33.8.4. Payment for unused vacation leave upon termination of employment.
Upon termination of employment, an employee is entitled to payment for unused current annual
vacation leave, less any deduction for sick leave used but not earned.
33.8.5. Jury Duty. [Amended 7-5-88 by Ord. No. 1335] An employee called for
service on a jury will be granted leave with full pay, less any compensation received for jury
duty, for the duration of the period for which they serve, without charge against annual vacation
leave. Parking or mileage fees will be retained by the employee.
33.8.6. Military Leave. [Amended 7-5-88 by Ord. No. 1335] Regular full-time
employees called to temporary or summer training duty with the armed forces as part of a
military program elected in lieu of active duty, shall be entitled to leave for a period not to
exceed two (2) calendar weeks per year. The township shall pay the employee their full pay
during the obligatory two-week service period. Leave without pay for a period not to exceed two
(2) calendar weeks per year may be granted to employees who, at their own option, enlist, reenlist,
or volunteer for training duty beyond that needed to discharge the United States
Government's military demands. A regular full-time employee called to extended active duty
with the armed forces who does not volunteer for service beyond the period for which called and
who returns to the township service within thirty (30) days of release from military service, shall
be granted the status of leave without pay, for that period and shall have credited to them the
amount of sick leave accrued prior to military service.
33.8.7. Official duty leave. An employee who is absent from his normal duty
station work while on official business of the township or while participating in training courses
to which he has been sent by the township or while attending professional conferences and
meetings authorized by the Township Manager shall be granted leave with full pay without
charge against annual vacation leave.
33.8.8. Non-Medical Leave Without Pay. [Amended 7-5-88 by Ord. No. 1335]
With the approval of the Department Head and the Township Manager, leave without pay may
be granted for a period not to exceed four (4) consecutive weeks. Written requests for leave
without pay, in excess of four (4) weeks and not more than one (1) year may be given special
consideration by the Township Manager. No leave without pay for more than one (1) year shall
be considered. The request for leave shall specify the date of return to work. If it is not possible
for the township to restore the employee to his or her former position, the employee will be
offered any available position suitable to his or her skills, training and ability, in the discretion of

§ 33 PERSONNEL SYSTEM § 33
33-7
the Township Manager, unless circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or
unreasonable to re-employ the employee. If an employee does not contact the Township
regarding return to work at the conclusion of the leave of absence, this will be deemed a
voluntary resignation.

1335] Non-exempt employees, who are required to work on a holiday or who must participate
in special overtime duties not included in the regular annual work program will be granted
compensatory time off at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) hours of compensatory time for
each hour of overtime worked in accordance with collective bargaining agreements or, for nonbargaining

property, or if the building or structure comes within the provision of Section 403.84(b), the
Code Official may prepare a Notice of Condemnation describing the unsafe conditions which

Occupancy or issuance of an Order to Discontinue Occupancy, any condemned portion of a
building or structure (whether or not any other portion of a building or structure is in unsafe
condition) constitutes or contains an exit which is required by law or ordinance, or is, in the
opinion of the Code Official, a necessary means of egress.

Official will reissue or renew any Certificate of Occupancy which may have been revoked, or
upon application, will issue a new certificate.
51.1.5.5.3. Authority to Abate. If, after expiration of the time
specified in the Notice of Condemnation, the owner, agent or PERSON in charge or control has
not abated the unsafe condition described in such Notice or has not appealed to the Board within
thirty (30) days of service of the Notice, as set forth in within this chapter or the Pennsylvania
§ 51 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 51

Official shall have authority to abate the unsafe condition by repairing, removing or demolishing
the building, structure, or part of the building or structure, at the expense of the TOWNSHIP.
Costs incurred in the repair, removal or demolition of a building or structure will be paid from
the treasury of the jurisdiction on certificate from the Code Official. These costs will be
recovered by the TOWNSHIP from the owner of the premises in an action of law in the Court of
Common Pleas. The TOWNSHIP will file the suit, with a statement of claim and a description
of the premises, at the Office of the Prothonotary of Allegheny County, so that it will be indexed
in the Judgment Docket and the TOWNSHIP will have a lien against the premises for the amount
of the claim.

condition cited in Notice of Condemnation, the Code Official shall have authority to decide

razed. If the Code Official decides to raze such building or structure and the owner thereof has
not, within thirty (30) days after condemnation, notified the Code Official in writing that the
owner desires to have all parts, appurtenances and materials removed from their place on the lot,
the Code Official shall have authority to allow the PERSON, firm, or corporation performing the
work of demolition to retain any and all such parts, appurtenances, and materials as payment or
part payment for the razing of the building or structure. If such parts, appurtenances and material
are placed on the lot, the owner will be required to use or dispose of them within fifteen (15)

No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the "INSURING AGENT")
doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named insured for
fire damage to a structure located within the Township of Upper St. Clair (hereinafter
"TOWNSHIP") where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies
exceeds Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000), unless the named insured or INSURING AGENT is
furnished by the TOWNSHIP with a municipal certificate pursuant to Section 508 (B) of Act 98
of 1992 and unless there is compliance with Section 508 (C) and (D) of Act 98 of 1992 and the
provisions of this Chapter.
§ 60.3. Payment of fire loss claims; transfer of insurance proceeds.
Where pursuant to Section 508 (B) (1) (I) of Act 98 of 1992, the TOWNSHIP issues a
certificate indicating that there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges
against real property, the INSURING AGENT shall pay the claim of the named insured,
provided however, that if the loss is agreed upon by the named insured and the INSURING
§ 60 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 60
60-2
AGENT equals or exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies
covering the building restructure, the following procedures must be followed:
60.3.1. The INSURING AGENT shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
designated officer of the TOWNSHIP in the aggregate of $1,000 for each $20,000 of a claim and
for each fraction of that amount of a claim, this section to be applied such that if the claim is
$20,000 or less, the amount transferred to the TOWNSHIP shall be $1,000; or

the INSURING AGENT, the named insured has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the
costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, the INSURING AGENT
shall transfer to the TOWNSHIP from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the
estimate.
60.3.3. The transfer of proceeds shall be on pro rata basis by all companies,
associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.
60.3.4. After the transfer, then named insured may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, and the
designated officer shall return the amount of the funds transferred to the TOWNSHIP in excess
of the estimate to the named insured, if the TOWNSHIP has not commenced to remove, repair or
secure the building or other structure.
60.3.5. Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the TOWNSHIP shall do the
following:
60.3.5.1. The designated officer shall place the proceeds in the separate fund
to be used solely as security against the total costs of removing, repairing, or securing the
building or structure which are incurred by the TOWNSHIP. Such costs shall include, without
limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the municipality in
connection with such removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceedings related
thereto; and
60.3.5.2. It is the obligation of the INSURING AGENT when transferring
the proceeds to provide the TOWNSHIP with the name and address of the named insured. Upon
receipt of the transferred funds and the name and address of the named insured, the designated
officer shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the
TOWNSHIP and notify the named insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be
followed; and
60.3.5.3. When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and orders of the
TOWNSHIP and the required proof of such completion received by the designated officer, and if
the TOWNSHIP has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall be
returned to the named insured. If the TOWNSHIP has incurred costs for repairs, removal or
§ 60 FIRE INSURANCE ESCROW § 60
60-3
securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess
funds remain, the TOWNSHIP shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured; and
60.3.5.4. To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the
TOWNSHIP pursuant to this Section, and not returned to the named insured, such interest shall
belong to the TOWNSHIP. To the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured,
interest earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the time that the
proceeds are returned.
60.3.6. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
TOWNSHIP to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the TOWNSHIP and the named insured from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or some other reasonable disposition of
the damaged property has been negotiated.
§ 60.4. Implementation of provisions; establishment of fees.
The TOWNSHIP Manager may adopt procedures and regulations to implement Act 98 of
1992 and this Chapter and the Board of Commissioners may establish reasonable fees to be
charged for municipal activities or services provided pursuant to Act 98 of 1992 and this

[HISTORY: Adopted as Chapter 64 by the Board of Commissioners of the Township of
Upper St. Clair on 8-4-14 by Ord. No. 2118.]
§ 64.1. Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the
Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety,
and the general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the Township
of Upper St. Clair does hereby order as follows.
§ 64.2. General Provisions.
64.2.1. Intent – The intent of this Ordinance is to:
64.2.1.1. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
64.2.1.2. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize FLOOD damage in the future.
64.2.1.3. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
§ 64 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 64
64-2
64.2.1.4. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents, by preventing excessive DEVELOPMENT in areas subject
to flooding.
64.2.1.5. Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
64.2.2. Applicability.
64.2.2.1. It shall be unlawful for any PERSON, partnership, business or

other improvement of a STRUCTURE, of which the cost equals or exceeds fifty-percent
(50%) of the market value of the STRUCTURE before the “START OF
CONSTRUCTION” of the improvement. This term includes STRUCTURES which have
incurred “SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE” regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a STRUCTURE to
correct existing VIOLATIONS of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code

§ 71 GRADING, EXCAVATION AND FILL § 71
71-9
71.6.2. Where, due to special circumstances and conditions, compliance with the
provisions of this Chapter would result in unnecessary hardship, the GRADING
ADMINISTRATOR may make such special reasonable exceptions thereto, upon
recommendation from the TOWNSHIP ENGINEER, as will not be contrary to the public
interest, and may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to adequately protect the public
interest.
§ 71.7. Expiration of Permit; Extension.
Every GRADING PERMIT shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the
work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within six (6) months or is not
completed within one (1) year from the date of issue, provided that the TOWNSHIP MANAGER
may, if the PERMIT HOLDER presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have
prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable
extension of time, and provided further that the application for the extension of time is made
before the date of expiration of the permit.
Any physical changes from the original plan uncovered in the SITE during the
construction such as surface water drainage, soil and BEDROCK dislocations, alteration of
ground water discharge or any other natural or man-made modification which would tend to
adversely affect the basis upon which the permit was issued, must be immediately reported to the
GRADING ADMINISTRATOR by the PERMIT HOLDER. If the circumstances dictate, the
GRADING ADMINISTRATOR shall revoke the permit or otherwise modify the conditions
upon which the permit was initially issued.
§ 71.8. Denial of Permit.
71.8.1. Where, in the opinion of the TOWNSHIP ENGINEER, the work as
proposed by the APPLICANT is likely to endanger any property or PERSON or any street or
alley or create hazardous conditions, the GRADING PERMIT shall be denied. In determining
whether the proposed work is likely to endanger property or streets or alleys or create hazardous
conditions, the TOWNSHIP ENGINEER shall give due consideration to: possible saturation by
rains, earth movements, runoff surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the stratification
and faulting of rock aquifers, springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
§ 71.9. Permit and Fees.

cost of $25,000 or more, the APPLICANT shall post a SECURITY acceptable to the
TOWNSHIP in the amount of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost to perform
the GRADING and remedial work. The cost estimate shall include the complete scope of work
needed to be performed by the APPLICANT to comply with this Chapter and shall be
determined by the TOWNSHIP ENGINEER.
71.10.1.1. For projects having an estimated cost to perform the work of less
than $25,000, SECURITY in the amount of fifty percent (50%) of the estimate as determined by
the TOWNSHIP ENGINEER shall be provided.
71.10.2. No SECURITY shall be required if SECURITY is posted for construction
and/or SITE improvements which already covers the cost of GRADING and other control
facilities.
§ 71.11. Inspections.
71.11.1. Application for the permit by the APPLICANT shall constitute consent to
enter the SITE for inspections at any time.
71.11.1.1. The GRADING ADMINISTRATOR shall, when requested by the
PERMIT HOLDER, make the inspections hereinafter required and shall either approve that
portion of the work which has been completed or notify the PERMIT HOLDER wherein the
same fails to comply with the provisions of this Chapter. Where it is found by inspection that the

§ 71.13. EXCAVATIONS.
Standards for EXCAVATIONS shall be as follows:
71.13.1. Maximum SLOPE steepness of a cut shall be two (2) horizontal to one (1)
vertical for minimizing EROSION and landslide HAZARDS. However, upon a determination
by a governmental review agency or a registered SOILS ENGINEER that the properties of the
types of soil on the SITE to be graded, as identified by the SOIL SURVEY, other standard
surveys, geological surveys or core borings, require special consideration, then maximum
SLOPES may then be determined as follows:
71.13.1.1. Landslide prone soils or unstable rock formations where existing
SLOPES are less than twenty-five percent (25%) shall have proposed cut SLOPES no steeper
than that are recommended by a registered SOILS ENGINEER. A document signed and sealed
by said ENGINEER shall be forwarded to the TOWNSHIP prior to approval of the GRADING
PERMIT. SOIL SURVEY map symbols for landslide prone soils include, but are not limited to:
UGD Urban land - Guernsey complex, gently sloping
0% - 8% SLOPE
UGD Urban land - Guernsey complex, moderately sloping
8% - 25% SLOPE
71.13.2. Cut SLOPES which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed
under a GRADING PERMIT, provided one (1) or both of the following is satisfied:
71.13.2.1. The material in which the EXCAVATION is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a SLOPE steeper than the SLOPE specified above for recognized soil conditions
on the SITE. A written statement, signed and sealed by a registered SOILS ENGINEER, stating
that the steeper SLOPE will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating a HAZARD will be
slight, must be submitted to the GRADING ADMINISTRATOR for evaluation.
71.13.2.2. A RETAINING WALL or other approved support designed,
signed and sealed by a professional structural ENGINEER and approved by the
ADMINISTRATOR, is provided to support the face of EXCAVATION.
71.13.3. The bottom edge of final SLOPES shall be set back a minimum of six (6)
feet from adjacent property lines, excepting side property lines and street right of way lines, in
which case the distance shall be a minimum of three (3) feet, in order to permit the normal
§ 71 GRADING, EXCAVATION AND FILL § 71
71-13
rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow for
location of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
71.13.4. Before commencing any EXCAVATION which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the PERSON making the EXCAVATION shall notify
in writing the owners of the adjacent property or buildings not less than three (3) days before
such EXCAVATION is to be made that the proposed EXCAVATION is to be started. Copies of
all such notices shall be supplied to the GRADING ADMINISTRATOR.
71.13.5. The GRADING ADMINISTRATOR may require an EXCAVATION to
be made with a cut SLOPE flatter than those specified above if he finds the material in which the
EXCAVATION is to be made is unusually subject to EROSION, or if other conditions exist
which, under applicable engineering practice, make such flatter cut SLOPE necessary for
stability and safety.
71.13.5.1. EXCAVATIONS adjacent to any footing, foundation or structure
shall not extend below the minimum angle of repose or natural SLOPE of the soil under the
nearest point of same unless such footing, foundation or structure is first properly underpinned or
otherwise protected against settlement.
§ 71.14. FILLS.
Standards for FILLS shall be as follows:
71.14.1. Maximum SLOPE steepness of a FILL shall be two (2) horizontal to one
(1) vertical in order to minimize EROSION and landslide HAZARDS. However, the
TOWNSHIP, on the advice and recommendation of a SOILS ENGINEER, may impose
conditions requiring that a FILL be constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two (2)
horizontal to one (1) vertical if the SOILS ENGINEER states that under the particular
circumstances involved, such flatter surface is necessary for stability and for the safety of
PERSONS and property.
71.14.2. FILL SLOPES which are steeper than those specified above may be
allowed under a GRADING PERMIT, provided one (1) or both of the following is satisfied:
71.14.2.1. The material of which the FILL is made is sufficiently stable to
sustain a SLOPE steeper than the SLOPE specified above for recognized soil conditions. A
written statement, signed and sealed by a registered SOILS ENGINEER, stating that the steeper
SLOPE will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating a HAZARD will be slight, must be
submitted to the GRADING ADMINISTRATOR for evaluation.
71.14.2.2. A RETAINING WALL or other approved support designed,
signed and sealed by a professional structural ENGINEER and approved by the GRADING
ADMINISTRATOR is provided to support the face of FILL.
§ 71 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 71

determined by the TOWNSHIP ENGINEER and specified on the GRADING PERMIT.
71.14.3.2. Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the FILL, including all embankments, planting and seeding areas, to a minimum
depth of six inches (6") to effectively conceal all materials used in the FILL other than clean soil
or earth. Prior to spreading topsoil, the subgrade shall be scarified to a depth of two inches (2")
to facilitate the bonding of the subsoil with the topsoil. If the filling operation is intermittent, the
TOWNSHIP ENGINEER may require that the top and exposed surfaces of the FILL be so
covered at the completion of each lift.
71.14.3.3. No FILL of any kind shall be placed over topsoil, trees, stumps or
other material which would create a nuisance, potential fire HAZARD or sanitary problem such
as decomposition which would attract rodents, termites or other pests.
71.14.3.4. FILL areas shall be prepared by removing organic material such as
vegetation and rubbish, and any other material determined by the GRADING
ADMINISTRATOR to prevent proper compaction and stability.
71.14.4. Where FILLS are located so that earth movement may result in personal
injury or damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys or buildings, the bearing value and stability
of the material under proposed FILLS and embankments shall be determined by subsurface
investigation performed by a SOILS ENGINEER.
71.14.5. All FILLS and embankments shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements set forth in the Public and Private Improvements Code, as well as any special
provisions as specified by a SOILS ENGINEER.
71.14.5.1. Rock may be incorporated into FILLS and embankments in layers
twenty-four (24) inches thick, maximum, with voids filled and a blanket of compacted FILL
separating one layer of rock from the next. Layers greater than twenty-four (24) inches thick
may be permitted by the GRADING ADMINISTRATOR upon submittal of a written statement,
signed and sealed by a registered SOILS ENGINEER, stating that incorporation of rocks of the
greater thickness will have sufficient stability.
71.14.5.2. Rock FILL shall not be placed near the bottom of foundations,
building caissons and subsurface utility installations. Suitable earth shall be reserved or provided
to cover rock FILL under proposed seeded or planted areas.
§ 71 GRADING, EXCAVATION AND FILL § 71
71-15
71.14.6. No unsuitable material, including but not limited to wood or SOLID
WASTE, shall be placed in FILL areas. Coal, boney, red dog, or expansive shale may in FILL
areas be permitted by the GRADING ADMINISTRATOR upon submittal of a written statement,
signed and sealed by a registered SOILS ENGINEER, stating that incorporation of these
materials will have sufficient stability.
71.14.7. On major FILLS or embankments, a toe bench to prevent erosion of soil
shall be constructed below the mantle under the toe of FILL. A porous drain and a discharge
pipe shall be installed on the bottom and the back wall of the toe bench.
71.14.8. The bottom edge of final SLOPES shall be set back a minimum of six (6)
feet from adjacent property lines, excepting side property lines and street right of way lines, in
which case the distance shall be a minimum of three (3) feet, in order to permit the normal
rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property or street and to allow for
location of proper drainage facilities and protective devices.
71.14.9. Pursuant to a determination by the GRADING ADMINISTRATOR that
the nature of a FILL or embankment so warrants, a compaction test shall be required at the end
of each eight inch lift, prior to the start of the next lift of material.
71.14.10. Within any IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREA, FILL, if used, shall:
71.14.10.1. Extend laterally at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line
from all points.
71.14.10.2. Consist of soil or small rock materials only. Sanitary landfills shall
not be permitted.
71.14.10.3. Be compacted to provide the necessary permeability and resistance
to EROSION, scouring or settling.

provide the following:
71.15.2.1. That the RETAINING WALL(S) not exceed a height of six feet
(6'), except where there is a showing of extraordinary circumstances.
71.15.2.2. If the plan incorporates terracing, the gradient of the SLOPE
between RETAINING WALLS shall not exceed two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical and that
the horizontal distance between walls be at least equal to the height of the RETAINING WALL.
71.15.2.3. Where a stable natural rock ledge is existing, as established by a
written statement from a registered, professional SOILS ENGINEER, a similar design of rock
ledge and ground SLOPE combination may be considered by the GRADING
ADMINISTRATOR.
71.15.3. When a RETAINING WALL is constructed to satisfy the requirements of
this ordinance and all other applicable codes (including, but not limited to the TOWNSHIP
Zoning and BUILDING CODES), a building permit will not be required in addition to the
GRADING PERMIT.
71.15.4. RETAINING WALLS must be designed and constructed in accordance
with sound engineering practice. The plans submitted for approval shall include a description of
proposed backfilling and subterranean drainage facilities and bear the seal of a professional

paved or lined with concrete, bituminous material, brick, half pipe, rubble or other suitable
material.
71.16.4. The GRADING ADMINISTRATOR may approve methods and materials
recommended by governmental agencies, professional ENGINEERS and ARCHITECTS, when
they are more suitable to the SITE in preventing damage. Private drainage facilities of any
nature shall be at least designed to accommodate the largest size storm that would occur on the
average of every ten (10) years.
§ 71.17. EROSION and Sedimentation Control.
The standards for soil EROSION and sedimentation control shall be as follows:
71.17.1. A soil EROSION and sedimentation control plan shall be prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Title 25, Environmental Resources, Chapter 102 Erosion
Control, and approved by the Allegheny County Conservation District (ACCD) prior to the
commencement of any GRADING or other regulated earth-disturbance activity, unless the
ACCD determines that said plan is not required.

material, the embankment foundation or the previous lift on which it
is to be placed is frozen. In the event that any fill which has already
been placed or the embankment foundation shall become frozen
before the next lift is placed, it shall be sacrificed and recomputed or
removed, to the approval of the Soils ENGINEER. Any soft spots
resulting form frost shall be removed or recomputed before new fill
material is placed, to the satisfaction of the Soils ENGINEER.
99.3.4.2.13.7. Moisture – if, in the opinion of the Soils
ENGINEER, fill material becomes too wet for the required
compaction, prior to commencing or continuing compaction
operations, the fill shall be dried by a method approved by the Soils
ENGINEER. If, in the opinion of the Soils ENGINEER, the fill
material becomes too dry for the required compaction, the fill shall
be moistened prior to commencing or continuing compaction
operations, by a method approved by the Soils ENGINEER.
99.3.4.2.13.8. Protection of Fill – protection of all compacted lifts
shall be responsibility of the Contractor. Damage to any compacted
lift, including those lifts previously tested and approved by the Soils
ENGINEER, occurring at any time during the course of construction,
caused by equipment, from moisture entering the embankment, or
from any other cause whatsoever, shall be fully repaired by the
Contractor prior to the placement of any overlaying materials, at his

test section at least ten (10) feet in length. Each open end of the test
section shall then be bulk headed with an appropriate adaptable plate,
one of which shall be fitted with a water valve and an air valve and
pressure gage. The bulkhead shall be attached to the pipe by an
approved method consistent with the type of pipe being tested.
Fabrication of the test section shall be performed in the field, and
shall be selected at random form the materials delivered to the job
site. Upon completion of the fabrication, the test section shall be
placed vertically and filled with water through the valve in the
bulkhead. When the test section has been completely filled with
water the water valve shall be closed and an appropriate source of
compressed air attached to the air valve. Air shall be added to the
test section until a pressure of 5 p.s.i. maintained for a period of 4
hours. After 4 hours, the pressure shall be released, without
expelling water, and the test section filled with the measured
amounts of water to determine the leakage for the test section.

test report.
99.3.7.2.11.2.2. Air Testing – all gravity sewers shall be
subject to a low pressure air test. The Contractor shall
furnish all the necessary labor, equipment and material to
perform the test. After flushing and removal of all
obstructions, the sections of sewer line shall be tested from
manhole to manhole. All openings, laterals, stubs, branches,
wyes, tees and pipe ends shall be securely capped or plugged
and adequately braced.
Air testing may be dangerous if, because of carelessness, a
line is improperly prepared for testing. An improperly
installed plug could cause a sudden explosion. No one shall
be allowed in the manholes during testing.
The air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged pipe until the
internal pressure reaches 5.0 p.s.i. for five (5) minutes.
Two minutes shall be allowed for a stabilization period
before proceeding further.
When the pressure is stabilized at 5.0 p.s.i. the air hose from
the control panel to the air supply shall be shut off or
disconnected.
§99.3 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.3
99-92
Additional pressures shall be applied to the above values to
compensate for ground water pressures on the pipe at the rate
of 0.5 p.s.i. per foot of water over the pipe.
Where L=Length of Pipe being tested.
If the time shown above for the designated pipe size elapses
before the air pressure drops 1.0 psi the section undergoing
the test shall have passed. The test may be discontinued once
the prescribed time has elapsed even though the 1.0 psi drop
has not occurred. If the section fails to meet these
requirements, the Contractor shall repair or replace the
materials and/or workmanship. The completed pipe
installation shall then be retested until the requirements of
this test are met.
99.3.7.2.11.2.3. Deflection Tests – after installation and
final backfill all pipelines constructed of flexible materials
shall be measured for vertical ring deflection by passing a test
ball or “go no go” Mandrel gauge through them to
demonstrate that the deflection is less that 5% of the diameter
of the pipe. [Amended 4-7-08 by Ord. No. 1996]
99.3.7.2.11.2.4. Weir Test – sanitary sewer may also be
required to be checked for actual infiltration by installation of
a V-notch Weir at the lower terminus of the new work, or
each section of new work. Measurements shall be made
immediately following periods of extended rain or when the
ground is saturated with water. The maximum infiltration
permitted for the system shall be 200 gallons per inch of pipe
diameter per mile of pipe per day. The sources of any
infiltration shall be determined and corrected.
99.3.7.2.11.2.5. Manhole Vacuum Test – after installation,
and preferably before backfill, manholes shall be tested for
leakage by the air vacuum method. All lift holes shall be
sealed. The pipes entering the manhole shall be plugged,

no displacement during placing of the concrete. All forms
shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to reuse and just prior to
placement of the concrete, the portion of the forms in contact
with the concrete shall be given a light coat of oil that will
not discolor the concrete.
99.3.9.2.3.1.4. Placing of Concrete—immediately prior to
placing the concrete, the subgrade shall be thoroughly
dampened so that it is moist throughout, but without puddles
of water. Concrete shall be placed in the forms as near to its
final position as practicable. Precautions shall be taken to not
overwork the concrete while it is still plastic. Concrete in
which an excess of water and fine material have been brought
to the surface will be rejected. The concrete shall be placed
in the forms and tamped and spaded just enough to compact
it firmly. The concrete may be compacted by means of
mechanical vibrators.

surface between the old and new pavements. There shall be a 1 foot
offset in each pavement course to permit each successive course to
overlap the lower existing course. Line cutting of existing
pavements shall be along neat, straight and even lines, and shall be
performed in such a manner so as not to damage the adjacent
pavement, which is to remain. The ENGINEER shall approve the
acceptability of the line cutting device and the method of operation,
and his decision shall be final.
§99.3 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.3
99-112
Unless specified otherwise or directed by the ENGINEER, the
following procedures shall be used:
99.3.10.2.3.2.1. Widening or Extension of Existing
Bituminous Pavements--line cut by approved method for
the full depth of the pavement prior to placement of any new
pavement. The existing bituminous surface shall be trimmed
to a neat true line with straight vertical edges free form
irregularities for a minimum depth of 1 ½ inches, and the
trimmed edges shall be treated with a light coating of
asphaltic cement or asphaltic emulsion immediately prior to
the installation of the new abutting bituminous concrete
surface course to provide a bond between the old and new
pavement. The new pavement surface shall be finished flush
with the adjacent pavement.

rectangular configuration. For all types of pavements
replacements, line cutting encompasses the disturbed area
and includes the required undisturbed pavement shelf as
specified herein.
99.3.10.2.3.2.3 . Bituminous Concrete Overlays—cut a
keyway no less than 24” wide by approved method where the
new pavement is to meet the existing pavement and around
inlets and manholes. The existing bituminous surface shall
be trimmed to a neat true line with straight vertical edges free
of irregularities for a minimum depth of one and one half (1
½) compacted inch. Sufficient pavement shall then be
removed to provide a minimum one and one half (1 ½)
compacted inch thickness of bituminous concrete overlay in
the area where the new pavement is to abut the existing
pavement. Immediately prior to the placement of the
bituminous concrete overlay the trimmed edges of the
existing pavement shall be treated with aphaltic emulsion to
bond the new pavement to the old pavement. The new
pavement surface shall be finished flush with the adjacent
pavement.

with mechanical equipment is impractical, spread and
compact by another acceptable method.
99.3.10.2.4.3.4 . If base course material is placed on existing
pavement as an overlay or build up, construct in compacted
layers.
99.3.10.2.4.3.5. If subgrade or subbase material become
mixed with the base course, remove the mixture; reshape and
recompact the subgrade and/or subbase; reconstruct the
unsatisfactory base course area.
99.3.10.2.4.3.6. Use calcium chloride only when and as
directed.
99.3.10.2.4.4. Initial Layer of Fine Material—spread an initial
layer of fine material uniformly over the subgrade, subbase or
existing pavement as a bed and filler; spread to a depth of 2 inches on
subgrade, or 1 inch on subbase or existing pavement. Do not place
this initial layer of fine material on wet, frozen or unsuitable
subgrade or subbase.
99.3.10.2.4.5. Construction Method I

approximately equal depth, with no layers less than 4 inches
nor more than 8 inches in depth.
99.3.10.2.4.5.3. Spread uniformly on the initial layers of
fine material to full width, unless otherwise specified. In area
inaccessible to spreading equipment, spread materials
directly form trucks. Remove segregated material and
replace with well-graded material. Do not spread the
material more than the distance completed in an average
day’s work ahead of choking and compacting.
§99.3 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.3
99-115
99.3.10.2.4.5.4 . Test each layer of material for surface

completed and the deficiencies have been corrected.
99.3.10.2.4.5.7. Roll parallel with the roadway centerline,
uniformly lap each preceding track, cover the entire surface
with the rear wheels, and continue until the material does not
creep or wave ahead of the roller wheels.
99.3.10.2.4.5.8 . Place red flags at the initial limits or
compacted coarse material completed. The flags will be
moved ahead as additional material is compacted. Do not
apply filler to the coarse material outside of the flag marked
sections.
99.3.10.2.4.5.9. Application of Fine Material—after
thoroughly compacting course material, spread material
uniformly over the surface with spreading equipment, to
assure filling voids. In areas inaccessible to equipment
spreading with a square-edged shovel may be allowed;
spread in a sweeping motion alternatively in opposite
directions, until the voids are filled. Do not end-dump the
material directly on the surface of the course material.
Immediately following the spreading, sweep and roll the
material until remaining voids in the course material are filled
and the base course is thoroughly compacted and set. Use
brooms attached to the roller and hand brooms. Loosen and
scatter excess fines formed in piles or cakes upon the surface.
99.3.10.2.4.5.10. Spread and roll the material in sections of
not less than 150 feet nor more than 1, 000 feet in length,

99.3.10.2.4.5.12. After completion of spreading and rolling
of fines, sprinkle with water and roll the surface of single
layer construction or roll the surface of each layer of multilayer
construction. Perform diagonal and cross rolling as
required or directed. Continue the sprinkling and rolling,
applying additional fines until voids are filled and a slight
wave of grout forms in front of the roller wheels. Use roller
attached brooms and hand brooms to distribute the grout
uniformly, filling the voids. Allow the rolled section to dry
before proceeding with the surface course. Sprinkle and
reroll the surface on succeeding days, as required, to
thoroughly bond and to provide a satisfactory base course.
The ENGINEER will determine the quantity of fines and
water required to produce a smooth, hard monolithic surface.
99.3.10.2.4.5.13. Sprinkle water, using acceptable methods.
99.3.10.2.4.6. Construction Method II
99.3.10.2.4.6.1. Use this method when compacting with
rollers and Vibratory equipment.
99.3.10.2.4.6.2 If the base course is more than 10 inches in
compacted depth, construct in 2 or more layers of
approximately equal depth, with no layer less than 5 inches
nor more than 10 inches in depth.
99.3.10.2.4.6.3. Spread the coarse material as specified in
Section 99.3.10.2.4.5.3 above.

coarse material has been set and keyed by vibration and
rolling, spread fine material uniformly over the surface in an
amount equal to about ½ of that required to fill the voids in
the coarse material. Operate the vibrator over the surface so
the fines settle into the voids. Spread and vibrate the
remaining fines in one or more applications to satisfactory fill
the voids; however, do not cause flotation of the coarse
aggregate. Use manual methods to fill areas not completely
filled by vibration.
§99.3 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.3
99-117
99.3.10.2.4.6.6 . Compacting and Bonding—after
completing the vibration of the fine material, sprinkle the
surface with water and roll. Continue the operation, as
specified in Sections 99.3.10.2.4.5.11 and 99.3.10.2.4.5.12
above.
99.3.10.2.4.7. Tests
99.3.10.2.4.7.1. Use a template cut to the required cross
section of the finished base coarse. Equip the templates with
metal or other vertical extensions attached to each end, so the
bottom of the template will be at the elevation of the top of
the base coarse. Test the cross section for surface
irregularities at intervals of not more than 25 feet.
99.3.10.2.4.7.2. Use a 10 foot straightedge to test for
longitudinal irregularities in the surface of the base coarse.
Hold the straightedge parallel to the road centerline in contact
with the surface. Move the straightedge from one side of the
base course to the other. Advance along the base course in 5
foot increments.
99.3.10.2.4.7.3 . Correct all surface irregularities exceeding
½ inch by loosening the surface and removing or adding
material as required. Compact the corrugated area and
surrounding surface by rolling.
99.3.10.2.4.7.4. Tests for Depth—cut or dig one test hole
to the full depth of the completed base coarse, where
directed, for each 3,000 square yards or less. The
ENGINEER will measure the depth of the base course. The
initial bed and filler layer of the fine material is considered
part of the base course for determining the final compacted
depth. Remove and replace any area in which the depth is
deficient by ½ inch or more. Additional test holes may be
required, if directed, to determine the limits of replacement
areas. After the depth has been measured, backfill test holes
with acceptable material and compact.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
[Added in its entirety 1-7-19 by Ord. No. 2201; Amended 6-3-19 by Ord. No. 2203]
99.4.2.15 This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Township of
Upper St. Clair Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
99.4.2.15.1. Statement of Findings – The Board of Commissioners of the
Township of Upper St. Clair finds that:
99.4.2.15.1.1. Inadequate management of accelerated RUNOFF of
STORMWATER resulting from development throughout a
WATERSHED increases RUNOFF volumes, flows and velocities,
contributes to EROSION and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of STREAMS and storm sewers, greatly increases the costs
of public facilities to carry and control STORMWATER, undermines
flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces GROUNDWATER RECHARGE, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
§99.4 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.4
99-148
99.4.2.15.1.2. A comprehensive program of STORMWATER
management (SWM), including regulation of development and
activities causing accelerated RUNOFF, is fundamental to the public
health, safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the
Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
99.4.2.15.1.3. STORMWATER is an important water resource that
provides GROUNDWATER RECHARGE for water supplies and
supports the base flow of streams.
99.4.2.15.1.4. The use of GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE (GI) and
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) are intended to address the
root cause of water quality impairment by using systems and
practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation
near where it falls to earth. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE practices
and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of predevelopment
hydrology.
99.4.2.15.1.5. Federal and state regulations require certain
municipalities to implement a program of STORMWATER controls.
These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for
STORMWATER discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) program.
99.4.2.15.2. Purpose – The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health,
safety, and welfare within the TOWNSHIP and its watershed by minimizing
the harms and maximizing the benefits described in §99.4.2.15.1. of this
Ordinance, through provisions designed to:
99.4.2.15.2.1. Meet legal water quality requirements under state
law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain,
reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of
this Commonwealth.
99.4.2.15.2.2. Preserve natural drainage systems.
99.4.2.15.2.3. Manage STORMWATER RUNOFF close to the
source, reduce RUNOFF volumes and mimic predevelopment
hydrology.
99.4.2.15.2.4. Provide procedures and performance standards for
STORMWATER planning and management.
§99.4 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.4
99-149
99.4.2.15.2.5. Maintain GROUNDWATER RECHARGE to
prevent degradation of surface and GROUNDWATER quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
99.4.2.15.2.6. Prevent scour and EROSION of STREAM banks and
streambeds.
99.4.2.15.2.7. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all
STORMWATER best management practices (BMPs) that are
implemented within the TOWNSHIP.
99.4.2.15.2.8. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit
requirements.
99.4.2.15.3. Statutory Authority – The TOWNSHIP is empowered to
regulate land use activities that affect RUNOFF by the authority of the Act
of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended, and/or the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864
(Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, The Stormwater
Management Act.
99.4.2.15.4. Applicability – All REGULATED ACTIVITIES and all
activities that may affect STORMWATER RUNOFF, including LAND
DEVELOPMENT and EARTH DISTRUBANCE ACTIVITY, are subject to
regulation by this Ordinance.
99.4.2.15.5. Repealer – Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of
the TOWNSHIP inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Ordinance is
hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
99.4.2.15.6. Severability – In the event that a court of competent
jurisdiction declares any section or provision of this Ordinance invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of
this Ordinance.
99.4.2.15.7. Compatibility with Other Requirements – Approvals issued
and actions taken under this Ordinance do not relieve the APPLICANT of
the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
99.4.2.15.8. Erroneous Permit – Any permit or authorization issued or
approved based on false, misleading or erroneous information provided by
an APPLICANT is void without the necessity of any proceedings for
revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant to such permit
or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by a board,
§99.4 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.4
99-150
agency or employee of the TOWNSHIP purporting to validate such a
violation.
99.4.2.15.9. Waivers
99.4.2.15.9.1. If the TOWNSHIP determines that any requirement
under this Ordinance cannot be achieved for a particular regulated
activity the TOWNSHIP may, after an evaluation of alternatives,
approve measures other than those in this Ordinance, subject to
§99.4.2.15.9.2. The proposed area of disturbance shall be less than
one (1) acre. The request for a modification or waiver shall originate
with the Landowner, shall be in writing, and shall accompany the
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN submitted to the
TOWNSHIP. The request shall provide the facts on which the
request is based, the provisions of the Ordinance involved, and the
proposed modification. The DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER
shall review the request to determine if it meets the requirements of
the Ordinance, including §99.4.2.15.9.2. below. If acceptable to the
TOWNSHIP, the TOWNSHIP may grant the waiver or modification.
99.4.2.15.9.2. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this
Ordinance may be approved by the TOWNSHIP if enforcement will
exact undue hardship because of unique physical circumstances or
conditions peculiar to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary or detrimental to the public
interest and will achieve the intended outcome, and that the purpose
of the Ordinance is preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique
physical circumstances or conditions and not to circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the Stormwater
Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden shall not be
considered a hardship. Modifications shall not substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property. A request for modifications shall be in writing and
accompany the STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN
submission, as directed in §99.4.2.15.9.1. above.
99.4.2.15.9.3. No waiver or modification of any regulated
STORMWATER activity involving earth disturbance greater than or
equal to one (1) acre may be granted by the TOWNSHIP.

retrofit projects that are solely intended to better manage RUNOFF
from existing development and are not part of new development or
redevelopment, are exempt from the STORMWATER management
provisions of this Ordinance. This does not exempt such projects
from any other municipal, state, or federal regulation.
99.4.2.15.14. SMALL PROJECTS
99.4.2.15.14.1. Table 1 and Table 2 present the TOWNSHIP’s
STORMWATER management requirements for SMALL
PROJECTS. For projects that propose additional IMPERVIOUS
AREA or earth disturbance to a parcel, the total proposed
IMPERVIOUS AREA and total proposed earth disturbance on the
parcel is subject to the requirements of this Ordinance.
IMPERVIOUS AREA is described in Section 99.4.2.15.12.5.

Comply with requirements of this
ordinance
99.4.2.15.14.2. Stormwater management for SMALL PROJECTS
will consist of capturing and detaining the first two inches of any
storm event. For SMALL PROJECTS, consider the following:
Two inches of rain results in the following volumes that need to be
captured and detained:
? 400 sq. ft. * 2 in./(12 in./ft.) * 7.48 gal/cu. ft. = 499 gallons of
detention storage.
§99.4 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.4
99-165
? 2,500 sq. ft. * 2 in./(12 in./ft.) * 7.48 gal/cu. ft. = 3,117 gallons of
detention storage.
Therefore, SMALL PROJECT detention requirements range from
499 gallons to 3,117 gallons.
99.4.2.15.14.3. Capture and detention can be accomplished by a
variety of methods, including, but not limited to:
99.4.2.15.14.3.1. Rain Barrels (could be drained through a
soaker hose)
99.4.2.15.14.3.2. Rain Gardens.
99.4.2.15.14.3.3. Stone Sumps (Dry Wells) and Infiltration
Trenches filled with clean, AASHTO No. 3 stone, 40% void
space.
99.4.2.15.14.3.4. Other Methods as approved by the
TOWNSHIP staff.
99.4.2.15.14.3.5. A combination of methods.
99.4.2.15.14.4. In all cases, the detention method shall be designed
to drain all accumulated RUNOFF not less than 24 hours and not
more than 72 hours after the end of the storm event. Appropriate soil
percolation conditions must be available for stone sumps and rain
gardens, and demonstrated by percolation tests.
99.4.2.15.14.5. A maintenance agreement must be signed by the
property owner to ensure the proper, continual inspection and
maintenance of the capture and detention method.
99.4.2.15.14.6. The property owner shall submit the following
STORMWATER management information for review by the
TOWNSHIP staff:
99.4.2.15.14.6.1. A written description of the proposed
project, including the dimensions of all proposed
IMPERVIOUS SURFACES.
99.4.2.15.14.6.2. A scale drawing showing existing and
proposed features of the property.
99.4.2.15.14.6.3. A written description of the proposed
STORMWATER management methods.
§99.4 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.4
99-166
99.4.2.15.14.6.4. Dimensioned drawings of the proposed
STORMWATER management methods and their locations.
99.4.2.15.14.6.5. A list of proposed IMPERVIOUS
SURFACES and their square footage.
99.4.2.15.14.6.6. Supporting documentation, such as
assumptions, calculations, rain barrel size, stone size,
percolation tests, etc.
99.4.2.15.14.6.7. Draft operation and maintenance
agreement.
99.4.2.15.14.7. Construction of the proposed improvements shall
not begin prior to receiving approval of the STORMWATER
management plan from the TOWNSHIP.
99.4.2.15.15. Volume Controls
99.4.2.15.15.1. The GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE and LOW
IMPACT DEVELOPMENT practices provided in the BMP Manual3
shall be utilized for REGULATED ACTIVITIES wherever possible.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in 99.4.2.15.15.1.1. or the Simplified Method in
99.4.2.15.15.1.2. below. Water volume controls shall be
implemented using the DESIGN STORM Method in
99.4.2.15.15.1.1. or the Simplified Method in 99.4.2.15.15.1.2.
below, or alternative design criteria as allowed by PA Code Title 25,
Chapter 102.
99.4.2.15.15.1.1. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the
BMP Manual3) is applicable as a method to any size of
regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions. The following shall be incorporated
into the CG-1 method:
99.4.2.15.15.1.1.1. Do not increase the postdevelopment
total RUNOFF volume for all storms
equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration
precipitation.
99.4.2.15.15.1.1.2. At least the first one inch of
RUNOFF from the net increase in IMPERVIOUS
SURFACES shall be permanently removed from the
RUNOFF flow, ie., it shall not be released into the
surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal
§99.4 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.4
99-167
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
INFILTRATION. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER
agrees, RUNOFF shall be detained in a facility
designed for a 24 to 72-hour dewatering time in an
area with a dedicated STORMWATER system (not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall
be detained in a facility designed for a 72-hour
dewatering time in an area contributory to a
combined sewer system before discharge to local
STORMWATER systems or the environment.
99.4.2.15.15.1.1.3. For modeling purposes:
99.4.2.15.15.1.1..3.1. Existing
(predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas
must be considered meadow in good
condition.
99.4.2.15.15.1.1.3.2. 20% of existing
IMPERVIOUS AREA, when present, shall be
considered meadow in good condition in the
model for EXISTING CONDITIONS.
99.4.2.15.15.1.2. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP
Manual3) provided below is independent of site conditions
and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not
followed. This method is not applicable to REGULATED
ACTIVITIES greater than one acre or for projects that
require design of STORMWATER storage facilities. For new
IMPERVIOUS SURFACES:
99.4.2.15.15.1.2.1. STORMWATER facilities shall
capture at least the first two (2) inches of RUNOFF
from the net increase in IMPERVIOUS SURFACES.
99.4.2.15.15.1.2.2. At least the first one inch of
RUNOFF from the net increase in IMPERVIOUS
SURFACES shall be permanently removed from the
RUNOFF flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the
surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
INFILTRATION. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER
§99.4 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.4
99-168
agrees, RUNOFF shall be detained in a facility
designed for a 24-hour dewatering time in an area
with a dedicated STORMWATER system (not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall
be detained in a facility designed for a 72-hour
dewatering time in an area contributory to a
combined sewer system before discharge to local
STORMWATER systems or the environment.
99.4.2.15.15.1.2.3. Wherever possible,
INFILTRATION facilities should be designed to
accommodate INFILTRATION of the entire
permanently removed RUNOFF; however, in all
cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently
REMOVED RUNOFF should be infiltrated.
99.4.2.15.15.1.2.4. This method is exempt from the
requirements of §99.4.2.15.16., Rate Controls.
99.4.2.15.16. Rate Controls
99.4.2.15.16.1. For areas not covered by a RELEASE RATE map
from an approved ACT 167 Stormwater Management Plan: Postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour
storm events. This Pre-development to Post-development control is
not to be misconstrued as the same as the “Conditional Direct
Discharge” areas on the RELEASE RATE maps. If it is shown that
the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated
by the pre-development analysis for 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-
year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been
met. Otherwise, the APPLICANT shall provide additional controls
as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak
flows should be computed using the methods included in the Chapter
titled “Stormwater Calculations and Methodology” of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
99.4.2.15.16.2. For areas covered by a RELEASE RATE map from
an approved ACT 167 Stormwater Management Plan: For the 1-, 2-,
5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24 hour storm events, the postdevelopment
PEAK DISCHARGE rates will follow the applicable
approved RELEASE RATE maps. For any areas not shown on the
RELEASE RATE maps, the post-development discharge rates shall
not exceed the pre-development discharge rates for the specified
design events. Peak flows should be computed using the methods
§99.4 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.4
99-169
included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP Stormwater Management BMP
Manual.
99.4.2.15.17. RIPARIAN BUFFERS
99.4.2.15.17.1. In order to protect and improve water quality, a
RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement shall be created and recorded as part
of any SUBDIVISION or LAND DEVELOPMENT that
encompasses a RIPARIAN BUFFER. The intent of this ordinance in
establishing a RIPARIAN BUFFER is to protect and improve
STREAM water quality. The RIPARIAN BUFFER is intended to
slow overland flow to the STREAM through the presence of native
grasses, trees and shrubs, allowing
INFILTRATION/GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; causing
deposition of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in
the buffer rather than in the STREAM; and reducing EROSION by
providing STREAM bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for
STREAMS; keeping waters cooler and reducing evaporation.
99.4.2.15.17.2. Except as required by PA Code Title 25 Chapter
102, the RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement shall be required for all
STREAMS (as defined in Article II) with a contributing
WATERSHED area of greater than ten (10) acres. The RIPARIAN
BUFFER Easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet
from the top of the streambank (on each side).
99.4.2.15.17.3. Minimum Management Requirements for
RIPARIAN BUFFERS.
99.4.2.15.17.3.1. No use or construction within the
RIPARIAN BUFFER shall be permitted that is inconsistent
with the intent of the RIPARIAN BUFFER as described in
99.4.2.15.17.1.
99.4.2.15.17.3.2. Existing NATIVE VEGETATION shall
be protected and maintained within the RIPARIAN BUFFER
Easement.
99.4.2.15.17.3.3. Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation
shall be actively removed and the RIPARIAN BUFFER
Easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and other
vegetation to create a diverse native plant community
appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.
99.4.2.15.17.4. The RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement shall be
enforceable by the TOWNSHIP and shall be recorded in the
§99.4 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.4
99-170
appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office, so that it shall run
with the land and shall limit the use of the property located therein.
The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and
shall count toward the minimum lot area required by Zoning, unless
otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.
99.4.2.15.17.5. Any permitted use within the RIPARIAN BUFFER
Easement shall be conducted in a manner that will maintain the
extent of the existing 100-year FLOODPLAIN, improve or maintain
the STREAM stability, and preserve and protect the ecological
function of the FLOODPLAIN.
99.4.2.15.17.6. STORMWATER drainage pipes shall be permitted
within the RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement, but they shall cross the
Easement in the shortest practical distance. Other structural
STORMWATER management facilities are not permitted within the
RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement.
99.4.2.15.17.7. The following conditions shall apply when public
and/or private recreation trails are permitted by the TOWNSHIP
within RIPARIAN BUFFERS:
99.4.2.15.17.7.1. It is preferred that trails be designed to be
permeable and for non-motorized use only; however,
impermeable trails are permitted provided they have adequate
drainage.
99.4.2.15.17.7.2. Trails shall be designed to have the least
impact on native plant species and other sensitive
environmental features.
99.4.2.15.17.8. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall
not be permitted within the RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement and
shall comply with setback requirements established under 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 73.
99.4.2.15.17.9. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the
RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement; however, work shall be performed
to minimize disturbance area and removal of trees. Restoration
within the RIPARIAN BUFFER Easement shall be with native
species of trees, grasses, and other plantings. One tree shall be
planted for each tree removed and the restoration shall be designed
by a Registered Professional with the requisite experience.
Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to cross the Easement
perpendicular to the Easement or in the shortest practical distance.
Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as required.

turning of vehicular traffic. A minimum radius of 30 feet is required for
DRIVEWAYS which permit trucks.
99.4.5.5.3. Where the STREET is curbed, DRIVEWAY approaches shall
be installed one and one-half (1 ½) inches above the adjacent highway or
gutter grade to maintain proper drainage. No filling of gutters shall be
permitted.
99.4.5.6. DRIVEWAY Classification – the ability of a DRIVEWAY to safely and
efficiently function as an integral component of a STREET system requires that its
design and construction be based on the amount and type of traffic that it is expected
to serve and the type and character of roadway which it accesses. DRIVEWAYS
are separated into 4 classifications, based on the amount of traffic that are expected
to serve. A description of each classification and typical examples of land uses
normally associated with each follows:
99.4.5.6.1. Minimum use DRIVEWAY, See Figure 99.5.5.6.1. A
DRIVEWAY normally used by not more than 25 vehicles per day, such as:
99.4.5.6.1.1. single family dwellings, duplex houses or
99.4.5.6.1.2. apartments with five units or less
99.4.5.6.2. Low volume DRIVEWAY, see Figure 99.5.5.6.2. A
DRIVEWAY normally used by more than 25 vehicles per day but not less
than 750 vehicles per day, such as:
99.4.5.6.2.1. office buildings
99.4.5.6.2.2. elementary and junior high schools
99.4.5.6.2.3. car washes
99.4.5.6.3. Medium volume DRIVEWAY, see Figure 99.5.5.6.3. A
DRIVEWAY normally used by more than 750 vehicles but less than 1500
§99.4 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE §99.4
99-186
vehicles per day, which does not normally require traffic signalization, such
as:
99.4.5.6.3.1. motels;
99.4.5.6.3.2. fast food restaurants; or
99.4.5.6.3.3. service stations and small centers or plazas
99.4.5.7. General DRIVEWAY Design – the design features described in this
section and illustrated in the attendant figures are to be used by the applicant in
designing the DRIVEWAY plans which accompany the application. Dimensions
shall be selected from the ranges of values shown on the appropriate figure, unless
site conditions warrant a deviation. The TOWNSHIP may require design details
which are more stringent than those specified in this chapter to insure the safe and
efficient operation of any proposed DRIVEWAY. Figures 99.5.5.6.1., 99.5.5.6.2.,
and 99.5.5.6.3. show two sets of design values. The applicant shall design his
DRIVEWAY using the values appropriate for the posted speed of the roadway being
accessed.
99.4.5.8. Angle of access DRIVEWAY approach – angle of access DRIVEWAY
approach shall include the following:
99.4.5.8.1. Access DRIVEWAY approaches used for two-way operation
shall be positioned at right angles, that is, 90°, to the STREET or as near
thereto as site conditions permit, except as authorized by the TOWNSHIP
upon recommendation of the Traffic ENGINEER.
99.4.5.8.2. When two access DRIVEWAYS are constructed on the same
property frontage and used for one-way operation, each of these
DRIVEWAYS may be placed at an angle less that a right angle, but not less
than 45° to the STREET, except that along divided STREETS where no
openings are allowed in the median the minimum angle of an exit
DRIVEWAY may be 30°.
99.4.5.9. DRIVEWAYS adjacent to intersections – DRIVEWAYS serving
properties located adjacent to a STREET intersection shall be subject to the
following:
99.4.5.9.1. There shall be a minimum 30 foot length tangent distance
between the intersecting STREET radius and the radius of the first permitted
DRIVEWAY.
99.4.5.9.2. The distance from the edge of pavement of the intersecting
highway to the radius of the first permitted DRIVEWAY shall be a
§99.4 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS CODE §99.4
99-187
minimum of 20 feet on curbed STREETS and 30 feet on uncurbed
STREETS.
99.4.5.9.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection may be waived only if the
intersecting STREET radius extends along the property frontage to the extent
that compliance is physically impossible.
99.4.5.10. Multiple DRIVEWAYS – Multiple DRIVEWAYS serving the same
property must be separated by a minimum distance of 30 feet measured along the
shoulder, ditch line, or curb.
99.4.5.11. Clear Sight Triangle – the area between the right-of-way line adjacent
to and on both sides of a DRIVEWAY shall be used as a clear sight triangle to
provide a physical barrier between the traveled way and activity on a private
property. This area shall remain free of any obstructions which may interfere with a
clear line of vision for entering or exiting vehicles. See Figure 99.5.1.3.2.7. for the
required clear sight triangle.
99.4.5.12. Sight Distance
99.4.5.12.1. Sight distance shall be measured from a height of the drivers
eye above the road surface is three and one-half (3 ½) feet and to an object
three and one-half (3 ½) feet in height. These conditions are for calculating
the site distance for DRIVEWAY of low volume STREET. The minimum
acceptable sight shall be computed from the following formula:
99.4.5.12.2. The minimum acceptable sight distance values shall be
computed from the following formula:
d=1.47Vt+V²/(30((a/32/2)±G)
d = minimum safe stopping sight distance (SSD)
V = Velocity of Vehicle (miles per hour)
t = Brake reaction time (2.5 seconds)
a = deceleration rate (11.2 ft/sec²)
G = percent of grade divided by 100
SSSD=1.47Vt + V²
30 (f ± g)
g = Percent grade of roadway divided by 100
SSSD = Minimum safe stopping sight distance (feet)
V = Velocity of vehicle (miles per hour)
t = Perception time of motorist (average = 2.5 seconds)
f = wet friction of pavement (average = 0.30)

quality of the WORK is in accordance with the
CONTRACT DOCUMENTS (subject to an
evaluation of the WORK as a functioning PROJECT
upon SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION, to the results
of any subsequent tests called for in the CONTRACT

subsequent inspections or tests, nullify any such
payment previously approved, to such extent as may
be necessary in his opinion to protect TOWNSHIP

drainage, locating the same as far as practicable in the center of the street or on either side of the
roadway or of the curblines thereof in any street, and such sewer or drainage system may be for
the service and use of properties on both sides of the street or on only one (1) side of the street in
which it is laid, as seems advisable to the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. [Amended 5-21-79
by Ord. No. 839]
106.2.2. The BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS may permit and, where necessary
for the public health, by ordinance require any owner of property benefitted, improved or
accommodated by sewers to make connections with such sewer or drainage system in such
manner as the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS may order for the purpose of discharge of such
drainage or waste matter as the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS may specify. The BOARD OF

connections.
§ 106.4. Location of sewers on private property.
Where it is reasonably impracticable, in the judgment of the BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS, in any part of such system, to carry such sewers or drains along the lines of
public streets or highways, the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS may locate and construct as
much of the same as is necessary through private lands and may acquire the necessary land or
right-of-way for such purpose by gift, purchase or by the exercise of the right of eminent domain.

ARTICLE III
Assessment of Costs
§ 106.10. Manner of assessment. [Amended 5-21-79 by Ord. No. 839]
The charge for any such sewer system construction in the TOWNSHIP shall be assessed
upon the properties benefitted, improved or accommodated in either of the following methods:
106.10.1. By an assessment, pursuant to TOWNSHIP ordinance against each lot or
piece of land benefitted, improved or accommodated by the sewer system, according to the footfront
rule, allowing such reduction in the case of corner properties and unusually shaped
properties, or in the case of those properties benefitted, improved or accommodated by more than
one (1) sewer, as the ordinance may specify. The ordinance may provide for equitable
assessments or adjustments when special conditions exist where an assessment for the full
frontage would be unjust. The TOWNSHIP MANAGER shall cause thirty (30) days' notice of
the assessment to be given to each party assessed, either by service on the owner or his agent or
by leaving such notice on the assessed premises. However, when the lot or piece of land is on a
comer it shall be assessed for its entire frontage abutting on any sewer, except that when such
property is a vacant lot or contains only a single-family dwelling it shall be assessed along the
shorter frontage and assessed along the longer frontage abutting on a sewer, commencing at a
point no closer to the comer than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet. When the TOWNSHIP
shall have determined to assess properties in proportion to frontage, any property benefitted,
improved or accommodated by the sewer which shall not be lawfully subject to such manner of
assessment, or as to which such manner of assessment shall not reasonably measure the benefit
to such property, shall be assessed by the TOWNSHIP in accordance with the method herein
provided in Subsection 2 of this section; but each such benefitted, improved or accommodated
property shall be assessed with not less than the whole amount of the benefit accruing to it and
legally assessable.
106.10.2. By an assessment against the several properties benefitted, improved or
accommodated by the sewer to the extent of such benefits. The amount of the charge on each
property shall be ascertained as provided in this chapter for the assessment of benefits.
§ 106.11. Procedure for assessment of benefits. [Amended 5-21-79 by Ord. No. 839]
The BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS shall have the right, when selecting the method of
assessment provided by § 106.9.2. rather than the foot-front rule provided by § 106.9.1., to either
petition the Court of Common Pleas for appointment of viewers to assess benefits or to
determine itself, at a public hearing, the equitable assessment of cost for the construction of any
system of sewers or drains to any property benefitted, improved or accommodated by such
sewer. In all cases where the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS shall neglect for a period of six
(6) months after the completion of the sewer system to either ordain assessments by frontage
under § 106.9.1., present a petition for appointment of viewers, or to themselves open public
hearings to determine the benefits, the taxpayers of the TOWNSHIP whose property evaluation
as assessed for taxable purposes within the TOWNSHIP shall amount to fifty percent (50%) of
§ 106 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 106
106-12
the total property evaluation as assessed for taxable purposes within the TOWNSHIP may
present a petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for the appointment of
viewers to assess benefits, or may file such a petition to the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS for
the commencement of public hearings. In all cases where such taxpayers shall, within three (3)
months of the adoption of any ordinance levying an assessment under the foot-front rule, by
petition state to the Court of Common Pleas that such assessment insufficiently represents the
benefits accruing to abutting properties, they may include in such petition a prayer for the
appointment of viewers to assess benefits or may petition for the Commissioners to commence
public hearings to reevaluate the assessment. If the taxpayers desire to petition to the Court of
Common Pleas, the Court shall thereupon appoint three (3) disinterested persons from the
County Board of Viewers, none of whom shall be a resident of that portion of the TOWNSHIP
which is accommodated by the sewer in question, and the viewers so appointed shall proceed
with action for the assessment of damages and benefits.
§ 106.12. Lien for assessment; costs of proceedings. [Amended 5-21-79 by Ord. No.
839]
After the amount of the assessment charged upon the several properties serviced by a
particular sewer has been established by one (1) of the three (3) methods available to the
TOWNSHIP, it shall be the duty of the TOWNSHIP MANAGER to file municipal liens for the
assessments covered by such ordinance or confirmation within the time and in the manner
provided by law, the same to be subject in all respects to the general law providing for the filing
and recovery of municipal liens. The amounts of all assessments shall be payable to the
TOWNSHIP MANAGER for the use of the TOWNSHIP. The BOARD OF COMMISSIONER
shall also make out bills for the amounts charged against each property, which bills shall be
forthwith sent to all property owners benefitted by the sewer. Any costs for publication of notices
for proceedings before the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS or before a board of viewers shall
be paid by the TOWNSHIP.3

necessary with respect thereto, and may make its approval of such plans subject to any
alterations, changes or modifications. Any plans, when so approved, shall be signed on behalf of
the TOWNSHIP by such officer as the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS may designate, and
shall be filed in the TOWNSHIP offices where the same shall be available for public inspection.
106.13.4. No drain, ditch, watercourse or drainage facilities shall be constructed,
altered, stopped, filled up, confined, paved or otherwise interfered with, except in strict
accordance with plans so approved by the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, or with further
plans subsequently approved by it in the same manner.

judgment are necessary to carry the water from the streets or highways.
106.14.2. It shall be unlawful for any person to stop, fill up or confine, pave or
otherwise interfere with any such drain or ditch, watercourse or drainage facilities, or to divert or
change the course thereof, without the approval of the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS as
herein provided.

premises at all reasonable times to inspect or to perform any duty imposed by this code; provided
that is such premises are occupied, the TOWNSHIP MANAGER or his designated representative
shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such entry is refused, the TOWNSHIP
MANAGER or his designated representative shall have recourse to every remedy provided by
law to secure entry.

TELEVISING INSPECTION cannot be performed because of weather conditions. In this case,
the applicant shall provide the Township with security in the name of the Township in an amount
established by Chapter 57, “Fees,” to guarantee that the DYE TEST and/or CLOSED CIRCUIT
TELEVISING INSPECTION of the sanitary SEWER LATERAL will be performed. The
applicant will cause the DYE TEST and/or CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISING INSPECTION of
the sanitary SEWER LATERAL to be performed within fourteen (14) days of written
notification from the Township which will be given at such time as weather conditions make the
DYE TEST and/or CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISING INSPECTION of the sanitary SEWER
LATERAL possible. In addition, the applicant shall provide the Township with a signed, written
acknowledgement from the purchaser agreeing to correct, at the purchaser’s sole expense, any
violations discovered as a result of a subsequent DYE TEST and/or CLOSED CIRCUIT
TELEVISING INSPECTION of the sanitary SEWER LATERAL. Nothing in this subsection
shall prohibit any purchaser from requiring the applicant to reimburse the purchaser for any costs
incurred; provided, however, that primary liability for correction of any illegal connection or
failure of A CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISING INSPECTION shall run with the land, and no
agreement between the applicant and the purchasers shall affect the Township’s enforcement
powers or excuse the current owner from performance; or [Amended 9-5-17 by Ord. No. 2175]

TEMPORARY EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE, provided the applicant provides the Township
with all of the following:
106.48.2.1. A bona fide executed contract between the applicant and a
registered licensed plumber to complete the necessary remedial work.
§ 106 SEWERS AND DRAINS § 106

118.5.1.5. A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by co-tenants; however, if any of the

made directly from the grantor to all of the possible beneficiaries that are entitled to receive the
property or proceeds from the sale of the property under the trust, whether or not such beneficiaries
are contingent or specifically named. A trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by
reference to the heirs of the trust settlor as determined by the laws of the intestate succession shall
not disqualify a transfer from the exclusion provided by this clause. No such exemption shall be

party was his principal, no tax would be imposed under this Article.
Where the DOCUMENT by which title is acquired by a grantee or
STATEMENT OF VALUE fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or
for the benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is the property of
the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this

Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of time during any TAX YEAR

sources within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION is less than twelve thousand ($12,000)

payment of the TAX:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the United

States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania

B. Procedure to Claim Exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services TAX may
annually file an exemption certificate with the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION and
with the person's EMPLOYER affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive EARNED INCOME and NET PROFITS from all sources within the
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION of less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a
copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall
have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION for the year prior to the
fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the TAX.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION or except as required by clause (2), the EMPLOYER
shall not withhold the TAX from the person during the calendar year or the
remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies,
EMPLOYERS shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily
available to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform
form provided by the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the TAX, upon notification to an EMPLOYER by the person or by the
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION that the person has received EARNED INCOME
and NET PROFITS from all sources within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION
equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the TAX exemption for that calendar
year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of EARNED INCOME within
the municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars
($12,000) in that calendar year, an EMPLOYER shall withhold the local services
TAX from the person under clause (3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the TAX
becomes subject to the TAX for the calendar year under clause (2), the
EMPLOYER shall withhold the TAX for the remainder of that calendar year. The
EMPLOYER shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under clause (2), a lump sum equal to the amount of
TAX that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll
§ 118 TAXATION § 118
118-25
period. The amount of TAX withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll
periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the
TAX under this clause is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person
shall be liable for any outstanding balance of TAX due, and the POLITICAL
SUBDIVISION may pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in clause (2), it is the intent of this subsection that
EMPLOYERS shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates,
monitoring TAX exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from the local
services TAX.
C. Refunds. The Township of Upper St. Clair, in consultation with the COLLECTOR
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any TAX
paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord
with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and
interest on overpayments. Refunds made within seventy-five days of a refund request or
seventy-five days after the last day the EMPLOYER is required to remit the TAX for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed one
dollar ($1): The Township of Upper St. Clair or the COLLECTOR shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
§ 118.25. Duty of employers to collect.
A. Each EMPLOYER within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION, as well as those
EMPLOYERS situated outside the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION but who engage in
business within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION, is hereby charged with the duty of
collecting the TAX from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him
within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION and making a return and payment thereof to the
COLLECTOR. Further, each EMPLOYER is hereby authorized to deduct this TAX for
each employee in HIS or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or
commission and whether or not all such services are performed within the POLITICAL
SUBDIVISION.
B. A person subject to the TAX shall be assessed by the EMPLOYER a pro rata share of
the TAX or each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an OCCUPATION.
The pro rata share of the TAX assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be
determined by dividing the rate of the TAX levied for the calendar year by the number of
payroll periods established by the EMPLOYER for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an EMPLOYER shall round down the amount of the TAX
collected each payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the
TAX shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person
118-26
§ 118 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 118
is engaging in an OCCUPATION, except as provided in Paragraph D of this Section, for
purposes of this paragraph, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the
TAX levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services TAX by more than one
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an EMPLOYER shall refrain from withholding
the TAX if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal EMPLOYER
that includes the name of the EMPLOYER, the length of the payroll period and the
amount of the TAX withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is
from the employee's principal EMPLOYER and the employee will notify other
EMPLOYERS of a change in principal place of employment within two weeks of its
occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
E. The TAX shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52) on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS within which a
person may be employed. The POLITICAL SUBDIVISION shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No EMPLOYER shall he held liable for failure to withhold the TAX or for the
payment of the withheld TAX money to the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION if the failure to
withhold TAXES arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the
employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal office or where the
employee is principally employed. Further, an EMPLOYER shall not be liable for
payment of the local services TAX in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
EMPLOYER if the EMPLOYER complies with the provisions of Paragraph B of Section
231-9.1 of this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance
with this article.
G. EMPLOYERS shall be required to remit the local services TAXES thirty days after
the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 118.26. Returns.
Each EMPLOYER shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the TAX on
forms to be supplied to the EMPLOYER by the COLLECTOR. If an EMPLOYER fails to file
the return and pay the TAX, whether or not the EMPLOYER makes collection thereof from the
salary, wages or commissions paid by HIM or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter
in this article, the EMPLOYER shall be responsible for the payment of the TAX in full as though
the TAX had been originally levied against the EMPLOYER.
§ 118.27. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
§ 118 TAXATION § 118
118-27
In each TAX YEAR, each EMPLOYER shall use HIS or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such TAX shall be deducted and paid over to
the COLLECTOR on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each calendar quarter of
each such TAX YEAR.
§ 118.28. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed INDIVIDUAL who performs services of any type or kind or engages
in any OCCUPATION or profession within a primary place of employment within the
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION shall be required to comply with this article and pay the pro rata
portion of the TAX due to the COLLECTOR on or before the thirtieth day following the end of
each quarter.
§ 118.29. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or employed in more than
one political subdivision.
A. The situs of the TAX shall be the place of employment on the first day the person
becomes subject to the TAX during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged
in more than one OCCUPATION, that is, concurrent employment, or an OCCUPATION
which requires the person working in more than one POLITICAL SUBDIVISION during
a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local services TAX shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION in which a person maintains HIS or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION in which the person resides and
works if the TAX is levied by that POLITICAL SUBDIVISION;
(3) Third, the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION in which a person is employed and
which imposes the TAX nearest in miles to the person's home.
In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year declaring
that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all
other POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS.
§ 118.30. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All EMPLOYERS and self-employed INDIVIDUALS residing or having their places of
business outside of the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION but who perform services of any type or
kind or engage in any OCCUPATION or profession within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION do,
by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and
regulations promulgated under this article with the same force and effect as though they were
118-28
§ 118 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 118
residents of the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION. Further, any INDIVIDUAL engaged in an
OCCUPATION within the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION and an employee of a nonresidential
EMPLOYER may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed person, and in
the event HIS or her TAX is not paid, the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION shall have the option of
proceeding against either the EMPLOYER or employee for the collection of this TAX as
hereinafter provided.
§ 118.31. Administration of tax.
A. The COLLECTOR shall be appointed by resolution of the POLITICAL
SUBDIVISION. It shall be the duty of the COLLECTOR to accept and receive payments
of this TAX and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by HIM from each
EMPLOYER of self-employed person, together with the date the TAX was received.
B. The COLLECTOR is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of this
article and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal approval, to proscribe,
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the
administration and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the examination
of payroll records of any EMPLOYER subject to this article, the examination and
correction of any return made in compliance with this article and any payment alleged or
found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the COLLECTOR shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998 (municipalities
may detail their appeal processes).
C. The COLLECTOR is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll records of
any EMPLOYER in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an EMPLOYER
or, if no return was made, to ascertain the TAX due. Each EMPLOYER is hereby directed
and required to give the COLLECTOR the means, facilities and opportunity for such
examination.
§ 118.32. Suits for collection.
A. In the event that any TAX under this article remains due or unpaid 30 days after the
due dates above set forth, the COLLECTOR may sue for the recovery of any such TAX
due or unpaid under this article, together with interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the TAX is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% on the
amount of such TAX shall be calculated beginning with the due date of the TAX and a
penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such TAX for nonpayment thereof. Where
suit is brought for the recovery of this TAX or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the
INDIVIDUAL liable therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
§ 118.33. Violations and penalties.
§ 118 TAXATION § 118
118-29
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this article, or
whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in HIS or her custody and control
setting forth the number of employees subject to this TAX who are in HIS or her employment, or
whoever fails or refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and costs of
prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than
30 days. The action to enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any EMPLOYER who shall have failed or who refuses to file a
return required by this article.
§ 118.34. Interpretation.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall he construed to empower the POLITICAL
SUBDIVISION to levy and collect the TAX hereby imposed on any OCCUPATION not
within the taxing power of the POLITICAL SUBDIVISION under the Constitution of the
United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the TAX hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be held by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States
or of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to any INDIVIDUAL, the
decision of the court shall not affect or impair the right to impose or collect said TAX or
the validity of the TAX so imposed on other persons or INDIVIDUALS as herein
provided.

§ 118.46. Excluded TRANSACTIONS.
118.46.1. Subject to the requirements of paragraph 118.46.2, below, the tax imposed by

118-38
§ 118 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 118

parties take shares greater in VALUE than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
118.46.1.6. A transfer between husband and wife, between PERSONS who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided the property or interest therein
subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to the

brother or sister or spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a brother or
sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild, except that a

made directly from the grantor to all of the possible beneficiaries that are entitled to receive the
property or proceeds from the sale of the property under the trust, whether or not such beneficiaries
are contingent or specifically named. A trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by
reference to the heirs of the trust settlor as determined by the laws of the intestate succession shall
not disqualify a transfer from the exclusion provided by this clause. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the RECORDER OF DEEDS is presented with a copy of the trust instrument that
clearly identifies the grantor and all possible beneficiaries.
118.46.1.8.1. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee

that beneficiary. However, any transfer of REAL ESTATE from a LIVING TRUST during the

party were his principal, no tax would be imposed under this Article.
Where the DOCUMENT by which title is acquired by a grantee or
STATEMENT OF VALUE fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or
for the benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is the property of
the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this

a debt of the grantee or a transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.

§ 118.48. ACQUIRED COMPANY.
118.48.1. A REAL ESTATE COMPANY is an ACQUIRED COMPANY upon a
change in the ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change:
118.48.1.1. does not effect the continuity of the company; and

FLOOD in the FIS are hereby established as FLOODPLAIN ZONING
DISTRICTS in accordance with the following ZONING DISTRICT
CLASSIFICATIONS:
Short Name Full Name/Description
FW Floodway ZONING DISTRICT: the areas identified as
floodways in the FIS.
FF Flood-Fringe ZONING DISTRICT: the areas identified as

revision of any FLOODPLAIN area identified in the FIS may be made without
prior approval from the FIA.
130.5.2.2.1. The FW (Floodway ZONING DISTRICT) is delineated for
purposes of this chapter using the criteria that a certain area within the
FLOODPLAIN must be capable of carrying the waters of the ONEHUNDRED-
YEAR FLOOD without increasing the water surface
elevation of that FLOOD more than one (1) foot at any point. The areas
included in this area are specifically defined in the Floodway Data Table
contained in the FIS.

130.5.2.2.3.2. The APPLICANT shall also delineate a floodway
area and provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate that the
proposed activity, together with all other existing and anticipated
DEVELOPMENT, USES, and activities, will cause no increase in
the water surface elevation of the ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR
FLOOD. The engineering principal of equal reduction of
conveyance shall be used to make the determination of increases in
flood heights. [Amended 10-2-95 by Ord. No. 1684]
130.5.2.2.3.3. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of

§130.25 AIRPORT HAZARD DISTRICT [Entire Section Added 10-1-12 by Ord. No.
2074]
130.25.1 Purpose: The purpose is to create an AIRPORT HAZARD Overlay
District that considers safety issues around the Allegheny County Airport, regulates and restricts
the HEIGHTS of constructed STRUCTURES and objects of natural growth, creates appropriate
zones, establishing the boundaries thereof and providing for changes in the restrictions and
boundaries of such zones, creates the permitting process for USE within said zones and provides
for enforcement, assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and judicial review.
130.25.2. Relation to Other Zone Districts.
130.25.2.1. The AIRPORT HAZARD Overlay District shall not modify the
boundaries of any underlying ZONING DISTRICT. Where identified, the
AIRPORT HAZARD Overlay District shall impose certain requirements on land
USE and CONSTRUCTION in addition to those contained in the underlying
ZONING DISTRICT.
130.25.3. Permit APPLICATIONS.
130.25.3.1. As regulated by Act 164 and defined by 14 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 77.13(a) (as amended or replaced), any person who plans to erect
a new STRUCTURE, to add to an existing STRUCTURE, or to erect and
§ 130.21-25 ZONING § 130.21-25
130-425
maintain any object (natural or manmade), in the vicinity of the airport, shall first
notify the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s (PennDOT) Bureau of
Aviation (BOA) by submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an
OBSTRUCTION review of the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement
thereof. The PennDOT’s BOA response must be included with this permit
APPLICATION for it to be considered complete. If PennDOT’s BOA returns a
determination of no penetration of airspace, the permit request should be
considered in compliance with the intent of this Overlay Ordinance. If the
PennDOT’s BOA returns a determination of a penetration of airspace, the permit
shall be denied, and the project sponsor may seek a VARIANCE from such
regulations as outlined in §130.25.4.
130.25.3.2. No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace
parts of existing STRUCTURES which do not enlarge or increase the HEIGHT of
an existing STRUCTURE.
130.25.3.3. No notice or review under this section is required for any of the
following CONSTRUCTION or alteration:
130.25.3.3.1. Any object that would be shielded by existing
STRUCTURES of a permanent and substantial character or by natural
terrain or topographic features of equal or greater HEIGHT, and would be
located in the congested area of a city, town, or settlement where it is
evident beyond all reasonable doubt that the STRUCTURE so shielded
will not adversely affect safety in air navigation.
130.25.3.3.2. Any antenna STRUCTURE of 20 feet or less in HEIGHT
except one that would increase the HEIGHT of another antenna
STRUCTURE.
130.25.3.3.3. Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or
landing aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device, of a type
approved by the Administrator, or an appropriate military service on
military airports, the location and HEIGHT of which is fixed by functional
purpose.
130.25.3.3.4. Any CONSTRUCTION or alteration for which notice is
required by any other FAA regulation.
130.25.4. VARIANCE.
130.25.4.1. Any request for a VARIANCE shall include documentation in
compliance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 77 Subpart B (FAA Form
7460-1 as amended or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a
VARIANCE will depend on the determinations made by the FAA and
§130.21-25 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 130.21-25
130-426
PennDOT’s BOA as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable air space. In
particular, the request for a VARIANCE shall consider which of the following
categories the FAA has placed the proposed CONSTRUCTION in:
130.25.4.1.1. No Objection – The subject CONSTRUCTION is
determined to not exceed OBSTRUCTION standards and
marking/lighting is not required to mitigate potential hazard. Under this
determination a VARIANCE shall be granted.
130.25.4.1.2. Conditional Determination – The proposed
CONSTRUCTION/alteration is determined to create some level of
encroachment into an AIRPORT HAZARD AREA which can be
effectively mitigated. Under this determination, a VARIANCE shall be
granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating measures as
described in §130.25.7 – AIRSPACE OBSTRUCTION Marking and
Lighting.
130.25.4.1.3. Objectionable – The proposed CONSTRUCTION/
alteration is determined to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A
VARIANCE shall be denied and the reasons for this determination shall
be outlined to the APPLICANT.
130.25.4.2. Such requests for VARIANCES shall be granted where it is duly
found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the public
interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and
will be in accordance with the intent of this ordinance.
130.25.5. USE Restrictions.
130.25.5.1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the TOWNSHIP CODE,
no USE shall be made of land or water within the AIRPORT HAZARD Overlay
District in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational
signals or radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult
for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise endanger or interfere
with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the Allegheny
County Airport.
130.25.6. Pre-Existing NON-CONFORMING USES.
130.25.6.1. The regulations prescribed by this section of the TOWNSHIP
CODE shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or
alteration of any STRUCTURE or TREE not conforming to the regulations as of
§ 130.21-25 ZONING § 130.21-25
130-427
the effective date these regulations are adopted by the TOWNSHIP of Upper St.
Clair, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a NON-CONFORMING
USE. No NON-CONFORMING USE shall be structurally altered or permitted to
grow higher, so as to increase the non-conformity, and a NON-CONFORMING
USE, once substantially abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance,) may
only be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
130.25.7. AIRSPACE OBSTRUCTION Marking and Lighting.
130.25.7.1. Any permit or VARIANCE granted pursuant to the provisions of
this section of the TOWNSHIP CODE may be conditioned according to the
process described in §130.25.4 to require the owner of the STRUCTURE or
object of natural growth in question to permit the municipality, at its own
expense, or require the person requesting the permit or VARIANCE, to install,
operate, and maintain such marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure
both ground and air safety.
130.25.8. Severability.
130.25.8.1. If any of the provisions of this section of the TOWNSHIP CODE
or the APPLICATION thereof to any person or circumstance are held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the CODE
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or APPLICATION, and to
this end, the provisions of this section of CODE are declared to be severable.

OF COMMISSIONERS, ZONING APPROVAL will be issued by the ZONING
ADMINISTRATOR.
130.36.4. Procedure for approval of amendments to PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
after FINAL APPROVAL or RECORDING. Any amendment to a PLANNED
DEVELOPMENT submitted after FINAL APPROVAL for recording which does not
violate any of the conditions or requirements of the TENTATIVE APPROVAL or of the
ZONING DISTRICT classification may be approved at an open meeting of the BOARD
OF COMMISSIONERS after recommendation by the COMMISSION provided, if the
amendment entails only a minor adjustment to the location of a STRUCTURE or to an
improvement of a minor LOT LINE change but does not entail any enlargement of a
STRUCTURE or any increase in the number of DWELLING UNITS, then such
amendment may be approved by the ZONING ADMINISTRATOR. Amendments
involving substantive changes or modifications to conditions must require a PUBLIC
HEARING following PUBLIC NOTICE as required by §130.36.2.3. of this Chapter.
Upon approval of the amendment, the recorded FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN must be
amended and rerecorded to conform to the amendment. [Amended 10-1-90 by Ord. No.
1453]
130.36.5. The time for recording of a FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN granted FINAL
APPROVAL by the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS is governed by the provisions of
Chapter 114, entitled “SUBDIVISION and LAND DEVELOPMENT,” Article III,
§114.20.1. [Added 4-4-83 by Ord. No. 1024]
130.36.6. Upon completion of the PUBLIC and PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS in a
FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, the provisions of Chapter 114, entitled
“SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT,” §§114.17, 114.23, and 114.24, shall
apply to the release of the SECURITY required under § 130.36.3.1.10. . [Added 4-4-83
by Ord. No. 1024]
130.36.7. The release of the SECURITY required under §130.36.3.1.10. is governed by
Chapter 114, entitled “SUBDIVISION and LAND DEVELOPMENT,” and the
§ 130.35-39 ZONING §130.35-39
130-461
acceptance of PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS and the required maintenance bond is
governed by §114.23. thereof. [Added 4-4-83 by Ord. No. 1024]
130.36.8. The remedies available to the TOWNSHIP to effect completion of PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENTS are governed by Chapter 114, entitled, “SUBDIVISION and LAND
DEVELOPMENT,” Article VI, §114.19. [Added 4-4-83 by Ord. No. 1024]
130.36.9. The provisions of Subsections 130.36.5., 130.36.6., 130.36.7., and 130.36.8.
above are intended to make uniform the requirements of this chapter and the
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT Chapter. Whenever the above-cited
provisions of the SUBDIVISION Ordinance are amended, those amendments will be
incorporated into this chapter as of the effective date of the amendment. [Added 4-4-83

§ 130.37. PLANNED SHOPPING CENTER, OFFICE CENTER AND INDUSTRIAL
PARK DEVELOPMENT.
130.37.1. Administration. PLANNED SHOPPING CENTER, OFFICE CENTER and
INDUSTRIAL PARK DEVELOPMENTS are permitted as CONDITIONAL USES and
LAND DEVELOPMENTS granted by the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. [Amended
10-1-90 by Ord. No. 1453]
130.37.2. Procedure for application and approval of a CONDITIONAL USE for
PLANNED SHOPPING CENTER, OFFICE CENTER and INDUSTRIAL PARK
DEVELOPMENTS. The procedure for the application and approval of a PLANNED
SHOPPING CENTER, OFFICE CENTER and INDUSTRIAL PARK DEVELOPMENT
is the same as the procedure for PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS as set
forth in §130.36., except that requirements for the APPLICATION FOR TENTATIVE
APPROVAL or the APPLICATION FOR FINAL APPROVAL, which specifically relate
to residential LOT USE requirements (i.e. DWELLING UNIT DENSITY), will not be
submitted in the APPLICATION FOR TENTATIVE APPROVAL or FINAL
APPROVAL. The procedure set forth in §130.36. must also satisfy the requirements of
Chapter 114 of the CODE entitled SUBDIVISION and LAND DEVELOPMENT. All
other LOT USE requirements, engineering and design requirements, recording
requirements and the procedural requirements of TENTATIVE and FINAL APPROVAL
will be considered part of the CONDITIONAL USE and LAND DEVELOPMENT
procedure as applied to PLANNED SHOPPING CENTER, OFFICE CENTER and
INDUSTRIAL PARK DEVELOPMENTS. [Amended 10-1-90 by Ord. No. 1453]
130.37.3. [Amended 4-7-86 by Ord. No. 1194] Discretion of grant modifications. The
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS shall consider whether proposed modifications
contained in the application to any of the applicable requirements of this chapter will
make for a more efficient, attractive and harmonious PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. If
such modifications, in the judgment of the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, constitute a
more beneficial USE of the SITE than provided for under the provisions of this Chapter,
§ 130.35-39 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 130.35-39
130-462
then the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS may grant the modifications. However, in the
IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREA, the following provisions will apply:
130.37.3.1. No modification will be granted for any CONSTRUCTION,
DEVELOPMENT, USE or activity within any Floodway ZONING DISTRICT
(FW) that would cause any increase in the ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD
elevation.
130.37.3.2. Under no circumstances will a modification be granted to the
prohibitions of § 130.21.4., entitled “DEVELOPMENT which may endanger
human life prohibited.”
130.37.3.3. Whenever a modification is granted to construct a STRUCTURE
below the ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD elevation, the TOWNSHIP shall
notify the APPLICANT in writing that:
130.37.3.3.1. The granting of the modification will result in increased
premium rates for FLOOD insurance; and
130.37.3.3.2. The modification increases the risk to life and property.
130.37.4. Standards and conditions for PLANNED OFFICE CENTER, PLANNED
SHOPPING CENTER and PLANNED INDUSTRIAL PARK DEVELOPMENTS.
130.37.4.1. PLANNED SHOPPING CENTER DEVELOPMENTS must be
provided in accordance with the provisions of Article IV for the ZONING
DISTRICT in which they are authorized and the foregoing Subsections 130.37.1.,
130.37.2., and 130.37.3.
130.37.4.2. PLANNED OFFICE CENTER DEVELOPMENTS must be
provided in accordance with the provisions of Article IV for the ZONING
DISTRICT in which they are authorized and the foregoing Subsections 130.37.1.,
130.37.2., 130.37.3.
130.37.4.3. PLANNED INDUSTRIAL PARK DEVELOPMENTS must be

ARTICLE VII
NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 130.40. Intents and purposes.
130.40.1. If, within the ZONING DISTRICTS established by this chapter or due to
amendments that may later be adopted, there exist LOTS, STRUCTURES or USES of
LOTS which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments,
this chapter permits those nonconformities. Such USES are incompatible with
AUTHORIZED USES in the ZONING DISTRICTS involved. Further, nonconformities
may not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other
SIGNS, STRUCTURES, or USES prohibited elsewhere in the same ZONING
DISTRICT, unless the ZONING HEARING BOARD may determine that the
enlargement, expansion or extension is necessitated by the natural expansion and growth
of trade.
130.40.2. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter requires a change in the
PLANS, CONSTRUCTION or designated USE of any STRUCTURE on which actual
CONSTRUCTION was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter and upon which actual CONSTRUCTION had been diligently
commenced. “Actual CONSTRUCTION” means the placing of CONSTRUCTION
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, except that where
demolition or removal of an existing STRUCTURE has substantially begun preparatory
to rebuilding, such demolition or removal is actual CONSTRUCTION, provided that
work is diligently carried on until completion of the STRUCTURE involved.
§ 130.41. NONCONFORMING LOTS.
130.41.1. In any ZONING DISTRICT in which SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS
are permitted, a SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING and customary ACCESSORY
BUILDINGS may be erected on any single NONCONFORMING LOT if the LOT is in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other LOTS in the same
ownership (provided that YARD dimensions and other requirements not involving LOT
AREA or LOT WIDTH, or both, of the LOT must conform to the regulations for the
ZONING DISTRICT in which such LOT is located). This provision applies even though
such LOT fails to meet the requirements for LOT AREA or LOT WIDTH, or both that
are generally applicable in the ZONING DISTRICT. Variation of YARD requirements
may be obtained only through action of the ZONING HEARING BOARD as provided
for by Article VIII, §130.54. [Amended 4-4-83 by Ord. No. 1024]
130.41.2. If two (2) or more NONCONFORMING LOTS or combinations of LOTS
and portions of LOTS with continuous frontage are in single ownership, and if all or part
of the LOTS do not meet the requirements for LOT WIDTH and LOT AREA as
§ 130.40-49 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 130.40-49
130-482
established by this chapter, the LOTS involved will be considered an undivided LOT for
the purposes of this chapter. No portion of the undivided LOT may be used or sold
which does not meet LOT WIDTH and LOT AREA requirements established by this
chapter, nor may any division of the LOT be made which leaves remaining any LOT not
meeting the requirements of this chapter.
§ 130.42. NONCONFORMING USES of LOTS.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lawful USE of a
LOT exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or
amended, such USE may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
130.42.1. No such NONCONFORMING USE may be enlarged or increased or
extended to occupy a greater LOT AREA than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless the ZONING HEARING BOARD
determines that the enlargement or extension is necessary by the natural expansion and
growth of trade of the NONCONFORMING USE.
130.42.2. No NONCONFORMING USE may be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the LOT occupied by such USE at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter.
130.42.3. If any such NONCONFORMING USE of a LOT ceases for any reason for
a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, any subsequent USE of such LOT
must conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the ZONING DISTRICT in
which such LOT is located.
§ 130.43. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful STRUCTURE exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter that could not be built under the requirements of this chapter, such STRUCTURE
may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
130.43.1. No such STRUCTURE may be enlarged or otherwise have any
STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS made to it in a way which increases its nonconformity,
except when the ZONING HEARING BOARD may determine undue hardship and may
authorize a reasonable modification of such STRUCTURE.
130.43.2. Should such STRUCTURE be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it may not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. In the event that
such damage or destruction is fifty percent (50%) or less than the replacement cost of the
STRUCTURE, it may be restored if such restoration is started within twelve (12) months
of the date of damage.
§ 130.40-49 ZONING § 130.40-49
130-483
130.43.3. Should such a STRUCTURE be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it must therefore conform to the requirements of the ZONING DISTRICT in
which it is located.
130.43.4. In addition to the requirements of §130.43.1., 130.43.2., and 130.43.3.
STRUCTURES existing in any IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREA prior to March 5,
1984, may continue, provided that no expansion or enlargement of any existing
STRUCTURE will be allowed within any identified Floodway ZONING DISTRICT that
would cause any increase in FLOOD heights. [Added 4-7-86 by Ord. No. 1194]
§ 130.44. NONCONFORMING USE of STRUCTURES.
If a lawful USE of a STRUCTURE or of a STRUCTURE and LOT in combination exists
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be allowed in the
ZONING DISTRICT under this terms of this chapter, the lawful USE may be continued, subject
to the following provisions:
130.44.1. No existing STRUCTURE devoted to a USE not permitted by this chapter
in the ZONING DISTRICT in which it is located may be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or otherwise have any STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS made to it
except in changing the USE of the STRUCTURE to an AUTHORIZED USE in the
ZONING DISTRICT in which it is located, unless the ZONING HEARING BOARD
determines that the enlargement, extension, CONSTRUCTION, reconstruction or
STRUCTURAL ALTERATION is necessitated by the natural expansion and growth of
trade of the NONCONFORMING USE.
130.44.2. Any NONCONFORMING USE may be extended throughout any part of a
STRUCTURE which was manifestly arranged or designed for such USE at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such USE may be extended to occupy any
LOT or portion of a LOT outside such STRUCTURE, except on a LOT or portion of a
LOT owned at the time the use became NONCONFORMING.
130.44.3. Any STRUCTURE or STRUCTURE and LOT in combination in or on
which a NONCONFORMING USE is superseded by an AUTHORIZED USE must
thereafter conform to the regulations for the ZONING DISTRICT in which such
STRUCTURE is located, and the NONCONFORMING USE may not thereafter be
resumed.
130.44.4. When a NONCONFORMING USE of a STRUCTURE or STRUCTURE
and LOT in combination is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months or for
eighteen (18) months during any three-year period, it shall be presumed that the use is
abandoned and the APPLICANT (owner) shall have the burden of presenting evidence to
show that the use was not abandoned. [Amended 4-1-96 by Ord. No. 1708]
§ 130.40-49 UPPER ST. CLAIR CODE § 130.40-49
130-484
130.44.5. Where nonconforming status applies to both the USE and the
STRUCTURE on the LOT, removal or destruction of the NONCONFORMING
STRUCTURE must eliminate the NONCONFORMING USE on the LOT.
§ 130.45. Repairs and maintenance.
Nothing in this chapter prevents the strengthening or restoring to safe condition of any
STRUCTURE or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
safety of the populace.
§ 130.46. USES approved under CONDITIONAL USE provisions.
Any USE for which a CONDITIONAL USE is approved in accordance with Article VIII,
§130.55., of this chapter, is not a NONCONFORMING USE but a conforming USE in the
ZONING DISTRICT.
§ 130.47. Standards for Change from One Nonconforming Use to Another
Nonconforming Use.
A change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use may be authorized
by the ZONING HEARING BOARD provided the new USE is no more detrimental to both the
purposes of the ZONING CODE and the neighborhood than is the USE that is to be discontinued
and replaced. [Added 10-6-97 by Ord. No. 1750]

chapter, and Chapter 114 entitled SUBDIVISION and LAND DEVELOPMENT
including but not limited to the names of all the legal or beneficial owners of the
APPLICANT if the APPLICANT is a corporation or a partnership. [Amended 10-1-90
by Ord. No. 1453]
130.50.3. In approving an APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT the ZONING
ADMINISTRATOR may require such changes in PLANS for CONSTRUCTION,
addition, STRUCTURAL ALTERATION or USE of such STRUCTURES or LOTS as
may be necessary to assure compliance with this chapter.
130.50.4. ZONING APPROVAL for any STRUCTURE or USE may be revoked
and withdrawn by the ZONING ADMINISTRATOR if the holder of the ZONING
APPROVAL has failed to comply with the requirements of this chapter or with any
conditions attached to the issuance of the ZONING APPROVAL; and the holder of the

ZONING APPROVAL for a SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING no later than thirty (30)
days after receiving the APPLICATION.
130.50.6. If no APPLICATION for a grading or BUILDING PERMIT to undertake
work described in an APPLICATION for ZONING APPROVAL for STRUCTURAL
ALTERATION or erection of STRUCTURES, has been submitted within twelve (12)
months of issuance of ZONING APPROVAL for STRUCTURAL ALTERATION or
erection of STRUCTURES, said ZONING APPROVAL will expire automatically
without written notice to the DEVELOPER unless the BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
extends the ZONING APPROVAL upon written request of the DEVELOPER received
prior to its expiration. The maximum extension permitted is one (1) twelve month
extension. [Amended 4-4-83 by Ord. No. 1024]
130.50.7. Although all other zoning requirements must be met, no ZONING

two (2) feet or more in diameter. [Added 7-76-93 by Ord. No. 1585]
§ 130.51. ZONING APPROVAL for OCCUPANCY and USE.
130.51.1. It is unlawful to use or occupy any STRUCTURE or LOT or part thereof
until ZONING APPROVAL has been issued by the TOWNSHIP. ZONING
APPROVAL shall state that the proposed USE of the STRUCTURE or LOT conforms to
the requirements of this chapter.
130.51.2. No NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE, USE or LOT may be
maintained, renewed, changed, or otherwise have any STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS

ZONING ADMINISTRATOR, owners of NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, USES
or LOTS shall apply for ZONING APPROVAL. All ZONING APPROVAL for
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, USES or LOTS must state specifically wherein
the nonconformity differs from the provisions of this chapter.
130.51.3. Where ZONING APPROVAL for OCCUPANCY and USE is necessary
to allow an OCCUPANCY PERMIT to be issued pursuant to the BUILDING CODE, and
where a BUILDING PERMIT has been issued, ZONING APPROVAL for

applicable ZONING DISTRICT regulations.
130.51.5. Where ZONING APPROVAL for OCCUPANCY and USE is necessary
in order to allow an OCCUPANCY PERMIT to be issued pursuant to the BUILDING
CODE for a new or changed USE of a LOT and where no BUILDING PERMIT is
required, an application for ZONING APPROVAL for OCCUPANCY and USE must be
made directly to the office of the ZONING ADMINISTRATOR. [Amended 4-4-83 by
