Huron, South Dakota

PREFACE 
    The Huron, South Dakota Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1964, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    This Code was republished by Municipal Code Corporation in May 2009. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with the 2009 republication, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up-to-date through Ordinance Number 2199-18-74, passed January 7, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with the 2009 republication, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with the 2009 republication, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with the 2009 republication, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Electronic Submission.

Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(2)  EXISTING USES. Before any existing use, structure, or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted in violation to the provisions of this chapter, within any zone hereby created, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on March 12, 1951 or the effective date of any amendment, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such permits shall be granted. 
(3)  NONCONFORMING USES ABANDONED OR DESTROYED. Whenever the city engineer or the building inspector determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty per cent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, (a) no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations, and (b) whether application is made for a permit under this paragraph or not, the city engineer or the building inspector may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip such object as may be necessary to conform to the regulations or, if the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree shall neglect or refuse to comply with such an order after ten days notice thereof, the city engineer or building inspector may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, or equipped, and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the object or the land wherein it is or was located. Unless such an assessment is paid within ninety days from the service of notice thereof on the agent or owner of such object or land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes. Except as indicated herein, all applications for permits for replacement, change, or repair of non-conforming uses shall be granted. 
(4)  VARIANCES. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the governing body of the City of Huron for a variance from such regulations. Such variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. 
(5)  HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable, effectuates the purpose of this chapter, and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the City of Huron, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

The review hearing and final decision shall take place within the applicable sixty (60) or ninety (90) day review period which shall begin on the date a complete application is submitted to the department. 
c.  The planning and zoning commission must approve, by majority vote of all members, an SCF application upon finding that the proposed installation has no reasonable alternative which better fits the location and design requirements of this chapter. The commission shall deny an application which does have a reasonable alternative which better fits the location and design requirements of this chapter. For an alternative to be reasonable, the alternative must be technically feasible, economically feasible, and must not impose an undue burden. 
d.  After the planning and zoning commission has made a determination on an SCF application, the department shall issue an SCF permit if the application was approved. If denied, the department shall provide a notice of final decision including the grounds upon which the planning and zoning commission denied the application. 
D.  Small Cell Facility Permit Applications. 
1.  Application Form. The director shall designate or develop an application form for an SCF permit. An application may include requests for new or replacement utility poles or SCF support structures. The director shall allow for applications to be consolidated pursuant to this section. Each applicant must submit a complete application for each permit desired. 
2.  Consolidated Applications. Each SCF permit request in a consolidated application shall be considered individually. 
3.  All applications for the placement of an SCF, including modification or construction of a utility pole or SCF support structure, submitted under this chapter shall include the following: 
a.  Photo Simulations. A photo simulation of a reasonably representative installation type that includes to-scale visual simulations that show unobstructed before-and-after construction daytime views from at least two angles, together with a map that shows the location of the proposed installation, including all equipment. A separate set of such materials shall be required for any design which is materially different. 
b.  Noise Study. A noise study for the SCF if (i) requested by the city, (ii) the proposed site is within twenty (20) feet of a residential structure, and (iii) the application proposes to utilize equipment which may produce a persistent or chronic audible tone at such distance. 
c.  Radio Frequency (RF) Emissions Compliance.

E.  General Standards. 
1.  Utility Pole Design. An existing utility pole may be replaced or extended to accommodate small cell facilities subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Replacement and New Utility Poles. Replacement utility poles shall be substantially similar to the width, color, and material of the original or adjacent utility poles. The city may approve minor deviations up to the minimum additional height needed to allow for the required clearance from electrical wires to accommodate an antenna or antennas and may also approve minor deviations up to fifty percent (50%) of the pole width at its base, not to exceed thirty inches (30"), when housing equipment is placed within the pole base. Replacement utility poles shall be located as close as possible to the existing utility pole, and the replaced utility pole shall be removed. Replacement street lights and poles shall conform to the adopted streetscape design standard for the zoning district. New utility poles shall mimic the design of a replacement utility pole that is most suitable for the proposed location. 
b.  Replacement and Existing Utility Pole Height. The height of any antennas at the top of a replacement or existing utility pole or any pole extender, shall be no higher than the greater of either 50 feet or the height of such utility pole or SCF support structure plus 10 percent. 
c.  Equipment Concealed. Whenever technically feasible, antennas, cabling, and equipment shall be fully concealed within a pole, or otherwise camouflaged to appear to be an integrated part of a pole. 
d.  Flush-Mounting and Pole-top Antennas. When technically feasible, antennas will be flush-mounted on a pole, which means either: (i) mounted directly to the pole with no gap other than that which may be required for screws, bolts, or similar hardware; (ii) located at the top of the pole; or side mounted by mounted arm as needed for required clearance. Canisters attached to the top of a pole shall not exceed the diameter of the pole, unless technically required, and then shall not be more than fifty percent (50%) greater than the diameter of the pole at the point of attachment or up to 16" in diameter, whichever is greater. 
e.  Antenna Design. Each antenna shall be located in an enclosure of no more than three (3) cubic feet in volume, or in case of an antenna that has exposed elements, the antenna and all of its exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no more than three (3) cubic feet. 
f.  No Illumination. Small cell facilities shall not be illuminated except for small status LEDs installed by the manufacturer. Such LEDs may not be of a nature which is likely to distract a vehicle or pedestrian due to brightness, size, blinking, other similar condition, or any combination thereof. 
g.  Generators and Battery Backup. Generators are not permitted for small cell facilities. A battery backup may be permitted if it is concealed consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
h.  Cabinet Location and Dimensions. Any equipment cabinet for a small cell facility shall utilize the smallest cabinet enclosure that is technically feasible to enclose the equipment. Disconnect switches may be located outside of the primary equipment cabinet. 
i.  Painting, Coating, or Finish Material. The exterior of an SCF shall be painted, coated, or be of a material which draws minimal attention from an observer. For example, an SCF painted in blaze orange or safety green is highly likely to draw attention and be distracting. An SCF finished with polished aluminum is more likely to be distracting than an SCF finished with matte grey paint. 
2.  Ground-Mounted Equipment. To allow full use of the public rights-of-way by pedestrians, bicyclists, and other users, all ground-mounted equipment, excluding antennas, shall, to the extent feasible, be either (i) undergrounded, (ii) incorporated into street furniture, or (iii) concealed in the base of a pole, and in all cases shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction standards, and any applicable state or federal regulations in order to provide clear and safe passage within the public rights-of-way. The location of any ground-mounted equipment shall also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction standards, and any applicable State or federal regulations in order to provide clear and safe passage within the public rights-of-way. 
3.  Building-Mounted Small Cell Facilities. Antennas may be mounted to a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building's architectural theme. 
a.  Balanced Design. Small cell facilities attached to the side or roof of buildings shall employ a symmetrical, balanced design for all façade-mounted antennas. Subsequent deployments on a structure's exterior will be required to ensure consistent design, architectural treatment and symmetry with any existing small cell facilities on the same side of the structure. 
b.  Architectural Preservation. The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is prohibited unless demonstrated to be unavoidable. 
c.  Complementary Architecture. New architectural features, such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal an antenna or antennas, may be used only if the new feature complements the architecture of the existing building. 
d.  Mounting Brackets. Small cell facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building. 
e.  Concealment. Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed conduit, cabling and wiring is prohibited. 
f.  Matching Paint. Small cell facilities, and all visible mounting hardware, shall be painted and textured to match adjacent building surfaces. 
g.  Permission. All installations of a small cell facility shall have permission from the utility pole or SCF support structure owner to install the small cell facility on such utility pole or SCF support structure. Nothing in this section affects the need for an applicant seeking to place a small cell facility on a utility pole or SCF support structure that is not owned by the city to obtain from the owner of the utility pole or SCF support structure any necessary authority to place the small cell facility, nor shall any provision of this section be deemed to affect the rates, terms, and conditions for access to or placement of a small cell facility on a utility pole or SCF support structure not owned by the city. This Section does not affect any existing agreement between the Department and an entity concerning the placement of small cell facilities on any city-owned utility pole or SCF support structure. 
4.  Preferred Projecting or Marquee Sign. Small cell facilities replicating a projecting or marquee sign must comply with the city's sign regulations. All antennas shall be completely screened by the façade of the sign. All cables and conduit to and from the sign shall be routed from within a building wall. Cable coverings may be allowed on the exterior of the building wall in limited circumstances and in situations where the coverings are minimally visible and concealed to match the adjacent building surfaces. 
5.  Parking Lot Lighting. Small cell facilities are permitted as attachments to or replacements of existing parking lot light fixtures. The design of the parking lot light fixture shall be in accordance with applicable municipal code and construction standards, except that a pole extender up to five (5) feet in height may be utilized. 
6.  Purely Aesthetic Standards. To the extent that a requirement is purely aesthetic, an SCF applicant shall not be required to meet a more burdensome standard than other users of the right-of-way. Other users of the right-of-way shall meet the purely aesthetic standards of this chapter for new or replacement deployments to the extent which is technically and economically feasible.

Chapter 18.43 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

18.43.100 - AUTHORIZATION, FACTS, PURPOSE AND METHODS 
18.43.110 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Dakota has in SDCL 9-36 and 7-18-14 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Commission of the City of Huron, Beadle County, South Dakota, does ordain as follows: 
    The City of Huron elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid Act, provides that areas of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.120 - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Huron are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.130 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.140 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.200 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
(1)  Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one percent annual chance (one hundred-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
(2)  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a onw percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
(3)  Area of special flood related erosion hazard is the land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After the detailed evaluation of the special flood related erosion hazard area; in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined. 
(4)  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, or AR/A. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard". 
(5)  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
(6)  Base flood elevation (BFE). Is the water surface elevation of the one percent annual chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas.

(12)  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
(13)  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
(14)  Existing structures. See "existing construction". 
(15)  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
(16)  Flood or flooding means: 
(a)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(i)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(ii)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(iii)  Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(b)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition. 
(17)  Flood elevation determination means a determination by the floodplain administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year. 
(18)  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the FEMA Flood Insurance Administrator has delineated the special hazard areas applicable to the community. 
(19)  Flood insurance study or flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood related erosion hazards.

(25)  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
(26)  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(a)  Listed individually or listed as a historic district in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

(27)  Letter of map amendment (LoMA). A LoMA is an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LoMA results from an administrative procedure that involves the review of scientific or technical data submitted by the owner or lessee of property who believes that property who believes the property has incorrectly been included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LoMA amends the currently effective FEMA map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(28)  Letter of map revision based on fill (LoMR-F). A LoMR-F is an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LoMR-F states FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area. 
(29)  Levee means a manmade structure usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
(30)  Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
(31)  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements. 
(32)  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
(33)  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
(34)  Map means the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for a community issued by the agency. 
(35)  Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
(36)  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
(37)  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
(38)  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(a)  Built on a single chassis; 
(b)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

(39)  Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
(40)  Special flood hazard area: See "area of special flood hazard". 
(41)  Special hazard area means an area having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, AH, or E. 
(42)  Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(43)  Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance purposes, means: 
(a)  A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof that is affixed to a permanent site; 
(b)  A manufactured home, also known as a mobile home or modular home, is a structure: built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or 
(c)  A travel trailer without wheels built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. 
For the purposes of this section "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle as defined above, except as described in paragraph (c) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
(44)  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(45)  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or 
(b)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
(46)  Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. 
(47)  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the FEMA NFIP Floodplain Administrator's Manual is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(48)  Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.400 - ADMINISTRATION 
18.43.410 - Establishment of floodplain development permit. 
(1)  A floodplain development permit shall be obtained from the floodplain administrator, fully completed, turned in and approved by the floodplain administrator (and FEMA if required) before any construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 18.43.320. A property receiving a letter of map amendment (LoMA) or letter of map revision based upon fill (LoMR-F) from FEMA must also obtain a floodplain development permit. Applicants are responsible to file requests for a LoMA or LoMR-F with FEMA and to pay all required fees. Applicants within the City of Huron and in the joint jurisdictional planning and zoning area surrounding the city on land zoned other than "AG" Agriculture or "AFPD" Ag Fringe Protection District are responsible to report the status of their requests for LoMA or LoMR-F to the city. 
(2)  Floodplain development permits are required for: Construction of any structure/building, installation of any permanent or temporary culvert, excavation, filling, paving, drilling, driving of piles, mining, dredging, land clearing, grading, permanent storage of materials and/or equipment, temporary stream crossings, or activities by government agencies (such as roads, bridges and structures, buildings.) 
(3)  Some "small projects" are exempt from the requirement to request development permits. Examples of "small projects" include: planting a garden, farming, putting up a mailbox, and erecting a flagpole. These projects will not impede the flow of floodwaters across a property. 
(4)  Permit Procedures. Application for a floodplain development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by the city and will include, but not be limited to: Plans drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations; existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and, the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required: 
(a)  Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; 
(b)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed; 
(c)  A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of Section 18.43.500; and 
(d)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(5)  Where base flood elevations are utilized, all new construction, substantial improvements and other development must comply with requirements of this section. Flood elevation documentation will be provided to the city on the FEMA Elevation Certificate (as shown in the FEMA NFIP Floodplain Administrator's Manual.) 
(6)  Floodplain Development Permit Review. Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
(a)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(b)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(c)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(d)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(e)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(f)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, drinking water and storm sewer systems; 
(g)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(h)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(i)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and 
(j)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.420 - Elevation certificate. 
    Use of a completed "elevation certificate" on a form provided to the city will ensure that the city is informed of the elevations of construction in and adjacent to the floodplain. The applicant is required to complete the form and set the elevations with the assistance of an engineer, architect or land surveyor signing off on the form. The engineer, architect or land surveyor will survey the site and set elevations to ensure that the elevation of the floodplain is known and that the lowest floor elevation of the proposed or expanding structure is at least one foot above the base flood elevation or that structure with a slab on grade or crawl space has the lowest floor at least three feet above the base flood elevation. Elevation certificates are required for new buildings and for substantial improvements/additions to existing buildings located in or adjacent to the floodplain. The city will use the FEMA Form 81-31 (from the FEMA NFIP Floodplain Administrator's Manual) as its "elevation certificate." 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.430 - Floodplain encroachment or "no rise" certificate. 
    All projects in the floodplain must undergo an encroachment review to determine their effect on flood flows and to ensure that the project will not cause any additional flooding. The City of Huron requires that encroachments will not be allowed in the floodplain if that encroachment might cause any increase in flood levels. Any proposed development or construction in the floodplain must be documented with an engineering analysis before the city will issue any permits related to the project. The proposed project request and "no-rise" certificate must be accompanied by the required technical data and must be signed by a registered professional engineer. The study will be based on the standard step-backwater computer model used to develop the one hundred-year floodway shown on the appropriate flood insurance rate map and the Beadle County Flood Insurance Study. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.440 - Floodproofing certificate. 
    Floodproofing means making a building watertight or substantially impermeable to floodwaters and is only allowable for nonresidential buildings. Designs for floodproofing must account for flood warning time, uses of the building, mode of entry to and exit from the building and site, floodwater velocities, flood depths, debris impact potential and flood frequency. According to FEMA regulations, floodproofed buildings must still have their lowest floor elevation at least one foot above the base flood elevation in order to receive credit for the purposes of flood insurance. The City of Huron requires that a "floodproofing certificate" be completed for any floodproofed nonresidential structure located in or adjacent to a floodplain. The "floodproofing certificate" must be signed by a registered professional engineer. The city will use FEMA Form 81-65 (from the FEMA NFIP Floodplain Administrator's Manual) as its "floodproofing certificate." 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.450 - Designation of the city engineer as the floodplain administrator. 
    The Huron City Engineer or his designee is hereby appointed the Huron Floodplain Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management within the municipal limits of the City of Huron and for land zoned other than AG "Agriculture" or "AFPD" Ag Fringe Protection District in the joint jurisdictional planning and zoning area surrounding the City of Huron. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.460 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    Duties and responsibilities of the Huron Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Review floodplain development permit applications to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(3)  Review, approve or deny all applications for floodplain development permits required by adoption of this chapter. 
(4)  Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required. 
(5)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. 
(6)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the South Dakota Department of Public Safety, Office of Emergency Management, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(7)  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(8)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 18.43.320, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Section 18.43.500. 
(9)  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood at any point within the community. 
(10)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12 National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (conditional letter of map revision). 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.470. - Variances. 
(1)  Variances in General. For the purposes of this chapter, a variance is a granting of relief from the requirements of this chapter and the FEMA floodplain regulations. Because a variance can create an increased risk to life and property, variances from flood elevation or other requirements in the flood ordinance should be rare. Granting variances is a local decision that must be based on local ordinances, state law and NFIP criteria. 
(a)  Variances are based on the general criteria of the general principal of zoning law in that they pertain to a particular piece of property and are not personal in nature. 
(b)  City of Huron Floodplain Ordinance Jurisdiction: 
(i)  The Huron Floodplain Administrator will hold a public hearing on variances to this chapter for applications for any property located within the Huron municipal boundary and make a recommendation to the Huron City Commission for their action. 
(ii)  The joint city and county planning commission with the Huron Floodplain Administrator will hold a public hearing on variances to this chapter for applications for any property located within the joint jurisdictional zoning area that are zoned other than "AG" Agriculture or "AGFP" Agricultural Fringe Protection District. 
(iii)  Beadle County has jurisdiction in areas zoned "AG" Agriculture or "AGFP" Agricultural Fringe Protection within the joint jurisdictional planning and zoning area surrounding the city; and over the balance of Beadle County. 
(c)  The Huron City Commission shall hold a hearing on variance applications according to their jurisdiction as noted above. Within the joint zoning jurisdiction the city commission and the county commission will each act on the recommendations of their respective floodplain administrators and/or planning commissions. To be in agreement in either approving or denying an application for a variance in the joint jurisdiction zoning area, both governing boards must act similarly to either approve or deny the request. If the governing board decisions do not agree, then the variance request shall be denied. 
(d)  Variances can only be granted for a parcel with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the floodplain ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or surrounding property owners. Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels; and the characteristics must pertain to the land, not to any structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
(e)  Variances should be granted only on a structure-by-structure review. Variances shall not be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions or entire subdivisions. 
(f)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum deviation necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief from the local, state or federal requirements. A variance request is a request to vary from the rules, not to ignore the rules. 
(g)  The record of every approved variance must include a copy of a written notice provided to the applicant that the issuance of a variance to construct a building with the lowest floor below the base flood elevation may result in increased flood insurance premium rates and that such construction below the base flood elevation may increase risk to life and property. This notification shall be maintained with the permanent record of all variance actions and will be part of the report made annually to FEMA. 
(h)  A copy of every approved variance application including variance findings, conditions and authorization will be recorded in the Beadle County Register of Deeds Office. This record will provide a means of permanent notification to future or prospective owners about the terms and conditions of the variance. 
(i)  All applications for variances to the controls of this chapter shall be accompanied by an application fee of one hundred dollars. 
(j)  Variances can only be granted in accordance with the NFIP variance criteria (44 CFR 60.6 (a). 
(k)  All variance actions shall be maintained in City of Huron files. Documentation to be retained shall include justification for their issuance. 
(l)  Notification of hearing on the application will be sent to landowners one-quarter mile (one thousand three hundred twenty feet) upstream of the application. The city may notify landowners in the immediate area of the proposed project who may be impacted by possible changes in the base flood elevation adjacent to the stream or area where the applicant proposes construction in or adjacent to the flood hazard area. 
(m)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed at or below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. Variances can only be issued if the floodplain administrator and city commission can make a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in any increased flood heights. 
(n)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Section 18.43.130). 
(o)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(p)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(i)  The applicant showing good and sufficient cause for granting the variance; 
(ii)  The applicant showing that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(iii)  The applicant showing that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  Variance Procedure. 
(a)  Applications for variances to the floodplain ordinance shall be provided, in full, to the floodplain administrator. Incomplete applications will not be considered. The floodplain administrator will hold a public hearing on the application and make a recommendation to the Huron City Commission. The applicant will have an opportunity to provide emphasis to items presented in their written variance application at the public hearings held by the floodplain administrator [and] the Huron City Commission. 
(b)  Every variance application shall address or provide: 
(i)  Applications for variances shall be provided to the floodplain administrator in writing and shall state the specific local, state or federal ordinance or regulation that the applicant wants relief from, and 
(ii)  The applicant must explain, in writing, good and sufficient cause for the variance, and 
(iii)  Printed maps that identify the specific location where the variance may apply, and 
(iv)  Written legal description and street address of the specific location where the variance may apply, and 
(v)  An elevation certificate (completed by a registered professional engineer, licensed architect or registered land surveyor) for the property in question, and 
(vi)  The applicant is required to identify elevations on the project site and to identify the base flood elevation on or adjacent to the proposed project site. 
(c)  The city engineer acting as the Huron Floodplain Administrator will hold a public hearing on the applicant's requested variance(s) from the requirements of the floodplain ordinance. The Huron Floodplain Administrator will take into consideration information provided to the city by the applicant; written or verbal comments made by the applicant, adjacent and upstream or possibly impacted property owners; any and all technical information and/or evaluations presented by the applicant, state or federal agency; and all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this or any other applicable city ordinance. 
(d)  The city engineer acting as the Huron Floodplain Administrator will make a recommendation on the applicant's request for a variance. The recommendation will be forwarded to the Huron City Commission for public hearing and action for a request related to property within the City of Huron. For request regarding property zoned other than AG in the joint jurisdictional zoning area surrounding the city, the city engineer's recommendation on the request will be forwarded to the joint planning commission for their consideration and recommendation. 
(e)  The Huron City Commission shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of the floodplain ordinance. The city commission will take into consideration the comments and recommendation of the floodplain administrator, the city planner and the city building official, information provided to the city by the applicant, all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(i)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; and 
(ii)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; and 
(iii)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners; and 
(iv)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; and 
(v)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; and 
(vi)  The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing and anticipated development; and 
(vii)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance for that area; and 
(viii)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; and 
(ix)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(x)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sanitary sewer, storm sewer, natural gas, electrical, water distribution systems, alleys/roads/streets, and bridges. 
(f)  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 18.43.470, variances and the purposes of this chapter, the Huron City Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(g)  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all variance applications, variances granted, and variance appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to South Dakota Office of Emergency Management. 
(h)  Variances can not be granted to resolve violations of this ordinance, any other city ordinance, any county ordinance or regulation, any state statute or a federal regulation. 
(3)  Appeals to City Commission Variance Decisions. Those aggrieved of decisions of the Huron City Commission, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decisions to the Third Circuit Court of Huron as provided in state statute. 
(4)  Variances to the FEMA Flood Insurance Administrator. Any decision of the Huron City Commission to grant a variance to the requirements of this ordinance shall be sent to the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program Administrator for review. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.480 - Annual report to FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Administrator and South Dakota Office of Emergency Management. 
    Annually, the local floodplain administrator shall prepare and submit a report of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance and submit the report to the FEMA National Flood Insurance Administrator and the state office of emergency management. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.490 - Appeals to administrative decisions. 
    The Huron City Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Huron Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.500 - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
18.43.510 - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and, 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. Septic tanks with drainfields are prohibited in the floodway. Holding tank type septic tanks may be allowable in the floodway with building official approval. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.520 - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Section 18.43.320, (ii) subsection 18.43.460(9), or (iii) subsection 18.43.530(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure accomplished in or adjacent to Zone A shall have the lowest floor for structures that include a basement elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. Any work accomplished in or adjacent to Zone A that will include a slab on grade or crawl space must have the lowest floor at least three feet above the base flood elevation. Applicants will document the elevation of the lot through the use of the FEMA elevation certificate. Properties that have received a letter of map revision (LoMR) based upon fill must still have their lowest floor elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection. 
(2)  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure accomplished in or adjacent to Zone A shall either: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor where a basement is included elevated to at least one foot above the base flood level, or 
(b)  Any work accomplished in or adjacent to Zone A that will include a slab on grade or crawl space must have the lowest floor at least three feet above the base flood elevation, or 
(c)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
Properties that have received a letter of map revision (LoMR) based upon fill must still have their lowest floor elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation. 
A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(a)  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(b)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
(c)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured Homes. 
(a)  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(b)  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to at least three feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(c)  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this section be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
(a)  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, 
(b)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
(c)  Meet the permit requirements of subsection 18.43.520(4), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.530 - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with this chapter. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of Section 18.43.330, Section 18.43.410, and the provisions of this section of this chapter. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 18.43.320 or subsection 18.43.460(8) of this chapter. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.540 - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 18.43.320, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Designate a regulatory floodway which will not increase the base flood level by more than one foot. 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Use of the FEMA elevation certificate and FEMA engineering "no rise" certificate is required to provide proof that there will be no rise. 
(3)  If subsection 18.43.540(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for and receives a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.600 - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Huron from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 6-1-2009) 
18.43.700 - Certification. 
    It is hereby found and declared by City of Huron that severe flooding has occurred in the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly occur within the future; that flooding is likely to result in infliction of serious personal injury or death, and is likely to result in substantial injury or destruction of property within its jurisdiction; in order to effectively comply with minimum standards for coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program; and in order to effectively remedy the situation described herein, it is necessary that this ordinance become effective immediately. 
    Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this ordinance, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.

Chapter 18.46 - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

18.46.010 - Introduction or purpose. 
    During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
    As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in Huron, South Dakota. The ordinance codified in this chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in Huron, South Dakota.

    The purpose of this chapter is to generate sufficient revenue to pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the system in proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS, and ammonia), volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs of each user or user class. The monthly charge or rental against each such user shall be determined by the application of the rates hereinafter prescribed, with the exception of the heavy industrial user. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.030 - Determining the total annual fixed, operation and maintenance cost. 
(a)  The city, or its finance officer, shall determine the estimated total annual fixed, operation and maintenance costs of the wastewater system. The total annual fixed costs shall include billing, meter reading, administrative and general costs associated with administration of the wastewater system. Total annual operation and maintenance costs shall include but need not be limited to labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, chemicals and materials, sampling and laboratory testing, studies and reports by special consultants, principal and interest of bonds payable from revenues of the wastewater system as such principal and interest become due, and an adequate reserve fund. 
(b)  The total annual operation and maintenance costs shall be allocated by percentage to each of the four parameters: flow (volume), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and ammonia-N. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004).

(d)  A significant industrial user is any other industrial user that discharges an average of twenty-five thousand gallons per day or more of process wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary noncontact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater) or contributes a process wastestream which makes up five percent or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW treatment plant. 
(e)  A categorical industrial user is a user which is an industry subject to categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  A heavy industrial user is a significant industrial user that discharges two hundred fifty thousand gallons or more and is an independent system separate from the city collection system. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.050 - Determining the wastewater system fixed cost service charge. 
    The city, or its finance officer, shall determine the fixed cost service charge by dividing the total annual fixed cost, as determined by Section 21.02.030, by the total number of residential, industrial and significant industrial users connected to the municipal wastewater system at the time of determining annual user charges. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.060 - Determining the wastewater system operation and maintenance service charge.

(Ord. 2038 (part), 2007: Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.080 - Determining a surcharge system for user with excess BOD, TSS, ammonia-N and/or toxic pollutants. 
    The city, or its city engineer, will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD, TSS, ammonia-N and/or toxic pollutants strengths greater than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above-normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two hundred fifty ppm BOD, two hundred fifty ppm TSS, and twenty-five ppm ammonia-N. The surcharge rate structure for such above normal strength waste dischargers shall be as hereinafter prescribed. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.090 - Monthly methods of charge for ordinary use. 
    Methods of charge are established for use of the sanitary sewer system as follows: 
(a)  RESIDENTIAL USERS. 
(1)  Each residential user of the municipal water works and wastewater system shall pay for the use and availability of such wastewater disposal service, a user service charge computed by multiplying the incremental cost, as determined by Section 21.02.030, by the volume of water consumed in one-thousand-gallon units, for unit of time, plus a minimum fixed cost per quarter, as determined by Section 21.02.030. The wastewater user service charge for any residential user is to be computed for water meter readings during December, January and February. If circumstances exist during the period the user service charge is computed that result in above or below average water meter readings for that period, the user service charge will be computed using a period that reflects normal usage rates. The monthly charge shall continue to apply to and be charged against the residential user until the end of each succeeding year when the new rates based on the winter quarter water consumption of the user or users owning or occupying the premises for the next twelve months is established. 
(2)  In the case of master metered duplexes, apartment houses or mobile home courts, the monthly sewer charge shall be determined in the following manner: The total winter month (month determined by the finance officer) water consumption shall be divided by the number of units to determine the average water consumption per unit. The regular user sewer rate will be applied to the average consumption per unit to determine the monthly charge per unit. The monthly charge per unit shall be redetermined each winter. 
(3)  For any residential user beginning to discharge to the wastewater system after the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective, a charge shall be made on the nonbase period monthly water meter readings and pursuant to this subsection (a), from the time such wastewater system connection is made or is begun, until the base period for the purpose of determining the maximum charge shall have occurred. 
(4)  Any residential user who has not established a monthly sewer charge shall pay a rate based on the residence they occupy until a monthly charge can be established pursuant to this section. 
(b)  INDUSTRIAL USERS. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, the owner or occupant of each industrial and commercial premises connected to the municipal waterworks and wastewater system, meeting the criteria of Section 21.02.040 for an industrial user shall pay for the use and availability of such wastewater disposal service, a user service charge computed by multiplying the incremental cost, as determined by Section 21.02.030. 
(2)  The city may classify industrial and commercial establishments as a residential user provided that the wastes from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from a residential user with respect to volume, suspended solids, five-day twenty degrees centigrade biochemical oxygen demand, and ammonia-N. 
(3)  Industrial users may be further subdivided as either heavy industrial, significant industrial or categorical users and the city may levy a surcharge, which may include: 
(A)  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program; 
(B)  Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; 
(C)  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(D)  Fees for permit applications; 
(E)  Fees for filing appeals; 
(F)  Fees for consistent removal by the city of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards; 
(G)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained in this chapter. 
(4)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained in this chapter. 
(c)  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. 
(1)  The city has determined that the average total suspended solids (TSS) and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential user are two hundred fifty ppm (BOD) and two hundred fifty ppm TSS. There shall be a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average residential user. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above normal strength wastes. Such users will pay for an additional service charge of five cents per one thousand gallons for each twenty-five ppm over two hundred fifty ppm of BOD and five cents per one thousand gallons for each twenty-five ppm over two hundred fifty ppm TSS. 
(2)  All sewer rates for services outside the city limits shall be thirty percent higher than those services within the city limits. 
(3)  The heavy industrial user rate will be determined by the city commission through the ordinance codified in this chapter.

21.02.100 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2141-21-73, adopted Feb. 10, 2014, renumbered the former § 21.02.100(b) as § 21.02.090(c). The historical notation has been retained with the amended provisions for reference purposes. The former § 21.02.100 pertained to the monthly rate of charge for ordinary use. 
21.02.105 - Additional charge for sewer services. 
    The monthly rate of charge for sewer rental fees for each class of user set forth in Section 21.02.090 are proportionally adjusted to that amount necessary to provide net wastewater revenue sufficient to pay one hundred ten percent of the wastewater debt service relating to the series 1991 bonds as approved in Ordinance No. 1643-30-167. The rate specified in this chapter will be collected as a surcharge on rates otherwise set forth in the sewer ordinance and will be collected if it is determined by the finance officer for the city, that sufficient funds from any source are not in place by February 1st of each year to fully pay that portion of the 1991 series bonds, which are due for that year. This section shall remain in effect for so long as the 1991 series bonds are outstanding. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.110 - Monthly collections for sanitary sewer services. 
    All accounts for sanitary sewer rental fees shall be paid with and in the same manner, as specified in Section 21.12.030, as payments for other utility billings made by the city to the owner or occupant of any premises or structure so served. Such billings shall be subject to penalties as provided by Section 21.12.030. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.120 - Sewer charges and rentals kept in separate fund. 
    Any and all funds, fees, rentals, charges or rates collected under authority of this chapter shall be credited to a separate fund known as a sewer rental fund. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.130 - Contracts for private connections. 
    Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit or restrict the power of the city to contract as granted by SDCL 9-48-32 as amended, and any contract heretofore or hereafter entered into under such power may be in lieu of any fees, rate, rentals or charges established under this chapter. 
(Ord. 1979 (part), 2004). 
21.02.150 - Review of each user's wastewater service charge. 
    The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than every two years and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established in this chapter and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. The city shall apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year and adjust the rate accordingly. If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body such factual information and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed. The city shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible.

21.04.070 - Regulations. 
(a)  GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of POTW whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and/or any substances with a flash point limit of less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit or sixty degrees Celsius; 
(2)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other pass-through or interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing or fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes, petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through; 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH of less than 5.0 or greater than twelve, or wastewater having other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW; 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act; 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair; 
(6)  Any substances which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with the sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used; 
(7)  Any substance, which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards; 
(8)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions; 
(9)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds forty degrees centigrade (one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit); 
(10)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants, (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause pass-through or interference with the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen minutes more than five times the average twenty-four hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation; 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such halflife or concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
(12)  Any wastewater, which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance; 
(13)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, roof runoff, cooling water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer without permission from the city engineer. 
    When the superintendent determines that a user(s) is contributing to the POTW, any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent may take enforcement against which may include, but not be limited to, penalties, civil damages and injunctive relief. 
(14)  Any hauled or truck pollutants, except at points in accordance with rules specifically adopted by the city. 
(b)  FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any substance, pollutant or wastewater which fails to meet the federal categorical pretreatment standards located in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subpart N, parts 405-471, which are incorporated into this chapter. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standards, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12. 
(c)  MODIFICATION OF FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited to federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" means reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system ninety-five percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of (Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403) - "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(d)  SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS. No person shall discharge wastewater causing the city influent concentration to be in excess of: 
Parameter: Maximum: Cadmium 0.142 mg/l Chromium III 3.0 mg/l Chromium VI 0.30 mg/l Copper 0.150 mg/l Lead 0.099 mg/l Nickel 1.342 mg/l Zinc 0.883 mg/l  
    Local limits are composite samples of total metals taken at the end of the users effluent line (at a point designated by the city). Local limits are technically based limits specifically designed to protect the city of Huron's POTW from receiving pass-through and interference of heavy metals or any other toxic substances. 
Local limits for users will be regulated as follows: 
Parameter: Maximum: Cadmium 0.012 mg/l Chromium III 2.66 mg/l Chromium VI 0.18 mg/l Copper 0.31 mg/l Lead 0.21 mg/l Nickel 3.00 mg/l Oil and Grease 100 mg/l Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons 10.0 mg/l Zinc 1.85 mg/l  
(e)  STATE REQUIREMENTS. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter. 
(f)  CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in Section 21.04.010 of this chapter. 
(g)  EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. 
(h)  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by March 1, 1990. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(i)  WRITTEN NOTICE. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law. 
(j)  NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental or dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(k)  SLUG AND SPILL PLAN. The city may require a user to develop a slug and/or a spill plan, which outlines discharge practices (including nonroutine batch discharges); describes storage; contains procedures both to notify the city immediately of slug discharges and to prevent adverse impacts from accidental spill.

This report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O and M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified professional. 
(2)  Periodic Compliance Reports. 
(A)  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the superintendent, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section. At the discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(B)  The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, or in the cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (c)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator, pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. 
    Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator. 
(3)  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard shall notify the superintendent prior to the introduction of wastewater pollutants or any substantial change in the volume or character of wastewater pollutants being introduced into the public sanitary sewer system. 
(4)  A failure of a user to meet any requirement is sufficient grounds and cause for the city to take appropriate action or to revoke a permit. 
(5)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sample and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(6)  Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard must submit a basis line monitoring report meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), which are incorporated into this chapter. 
(7)  Users of the publicly owned treatment works will submit to the city all reports required in 40 CFR 403.12, which is incorporated by reference, including, but not limited to, notice of violation within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation, notice of a changed discharge prior to the release of the changed discharge, and notice of discharge of hazardous waste. 
(8)  Users must keep records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three years, as specified in 40 CFR 403.12(0), which is incorporated by reference. The retention time shall be expanded upon notification by the city to the user. The city shall have the right to inspect and copy pretreatment records of the user. 
(d)  MONITORING FACILITIES. The city shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the users, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
    There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
    Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following written notification by the city. 
(e)  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority, and (where the NPDES state is the approval authority) EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities and shall have authority to inspect and copy a user's pretreatment records. 
(f)  PRETREATMENT. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(1)  The city shall annually publish in the Huron Plainsman newspaper a list of the users, which were in significant noncompliance (SNC). For the purposes of this provision, "significant noncompliance" means: 
(A)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter; 
(B)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those which thirty-three percent or more of all measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH.);

23.46.003 - Intent. 
    The key fundamental issue generating overall concern on the part of the city and Beadle County for the joint jurisdictional area is the continuation and spread of remote but concentrated development. This development is in the form of urban densities and urban types of use which must be addressed for both entities for future service capability or land use compatibility. Numerous elements lead to and compound this situation. Listed in this chapter are some of the issue elements. 
(Ord. 1843 (part), 1999). 
23.46.005 - Land use objectives. 
A.  Land use shall be developed and maintained which will keep the urban areas consolidated to minimize the need for public services.

Land in rural areas shall be regulated to address residential development through the establishment of minimum lot sizes and other appropriate regulations. 
1.  General: 
(a)  Protection of floodplain and drainage areas; 
(b)  Prevention of potential ground and surface water pollution through controls on runoff drainage and concentrated development;

(a)  Provisions for widely dispersed housing development in rural areas; 
(b)  Control over the expansion of dense pockets and strip rows of housing which may result in pollution and health hazards; 
(c)  Creation and/or improvement of standards for proper development of the types of residential uses to be allowed (i.e. mobile homes, single family residences, apartments). 
4.  Commercial/business: 
(a)  Prevention of improper forms of strip commercial development along major access routes; 
(b)  Prevention of drainage and pollution problems resulting from commercial agricultural (animal confinement) businesses; 
(c)  Control over the mix and type of commercial uses with respect to residential development and use. 
5.  Industrial: 
(a)  Location of industrial uses compatible to the surrounding neighborhood; 
(b)  Utilization of existing industrial parks and land within the city rather than continued spread into undeveloped and unserviced areas. 
(Ord. 1843 (part), 1999). 
23.46.007 - Administrative policies. 
A.  The city and county shall be responsible for enforcement of zoning in their respective zoning districts. The focus of development shall be on building codes, sewer, water and utilities provisions and zoning conformance.

24.04.010 - Purpose and interpretation. 
    Each new addition or subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic physical structure of the future community, a unit to which the future community will of necessity be forced to adhere. Piecemeal planning of such additions or subdivisions, without relation to the city master plan, will bring a disastrous disconnected patchwork of plats and poor circulation of traffic. In order that new additions and subdivisions will contribute toward an attractive, orderly, stable and wholesome community environment with adequate municipal services and safe streets, all areas hereafter platted within the city limits shall, in all respects, fully comply with the regulations set forth in this title. In interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the public health, safety and general welfare.

(Ord. 1987 (part), 2005: Ord. 824 § 2, 1963).

    Any person, firm or corporation who submits a request to the planning commission to divide a lot which is a part of a recorded plat where the division is to permit the addition of a parcel of land to an abutting lot or to create two lots and a newly created property line which will not cause the remaining portion of the lot to be in violation with this title or Title 23, this division may be approved and recommended by the planning commission to the governing body after submission of a proper plat of the area that has been filed with the planning commission by a registered land surveyor. 
(Ord. 1987 (part), 2005: Ord. 1001, 1971; Ord. 824, 1963).

They pertain to historic buildings and structures of all materials, construction types, sizes, and occupancy and encompass the exterior and the interior of historic buildings and structures. The Standards also encompass related landscape features and the building or structure's site and environment as well as attached adjacent or related new construction. The Standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. The standards include but are not limited to: 
A.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building or structure and its site and environment. 
B.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
C.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings or structures, shall not be undertaken. 
D.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
E.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
F.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
G.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
H.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
I.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
J.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

Recommendation in Support of the Proposed Project: After review, if the Board of Historic Preservation believes that the proposed work preserves the historic property, it shall promptly forward that recommendation along with its report on the proposed project to city staff. Upon receipt of the recommendation to allow the work, city staff will determine whether a city building permit can be issued. Applications for a permit may be disapproved by city staff if the proposed work does not meet applicable building codes. 
2.  Recommendation Against the Proposed Project: After review, if the Huron Board of Historic Preservation believes that the requested work will not preserve the historic structure, it will discuss and negotiate with the applicant in an attempt to convince the applicant to revise the project to make it appropriate to the historic structure. The applicant may proceed with his project after one hundred eighty (180) days of submitting a written application for the project being submitted to the city whether or not an agreement has been reached with the Board. If the Huron Board of Historic Preservation determines that a requested project is not appropriate to the historic property, it shall place in its records the reasons for this determination and shall promptly notify the applicant, furnishing the applicant an attested copy of its reasons and its recommendations.
