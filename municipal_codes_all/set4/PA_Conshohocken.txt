§ 5-123. Supplementary Definitions for Floodplain Conservation
District Provisions. [Ord. 6-1996, 12/19/1996, § 1; as amended by
Ord. 9-2008, 12/17/2008]
The following are definitions which shall be used in making reasonable
interpretations of the provisions contained in §§ 5-121 and 5-122:
BASE FLOOD  The flood which has been selected to serve as the basis
upon which the floodplain management provisions of this and other
ordinances have been prepared; for purposes of this Part, the one-hundredyear
flood, as referenced in the current Flood Insurance Study, Borough
of Conshohocken, prepared by the U.S. Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION  The one-hundred-year flood elevation, as
referenced in the Flood Insurance Study, Borough of Conshohocken,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
CONSTRUCTION  The construction, reconstruction, renovation, repair,
extension, expansion, alteration or relocation of a building or structure,
including the placement of manufactured homes.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, the
placement of manufactured homes, streets and other paving, utilities,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials and the subdivision of land.
FLOOD  A temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents. Such measures are set forth in
floodproofing regulations published by the Office of the Chief Engineers,
Enforcement Officer for possible incorporation into the proposed
plan.
D. Other Permit Issuance Requirements. Prior to the issuance of any
building permit the Borough Code Enforcement Officer shall review
the application for a permit to determine if all other necessary
governmental permits such as those required by State and Federal
laws have been obtained, including those required by Act 537, the
Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act, Dam Safety and Encroachment
Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972 404, 33, U.S.C. 1334. No permit shall be issued until this
determination has been made.
E. Start of Construction. For purposes of implementation of these
provisions, start of construction shall be considered as defined in
§ 5-123 of this Part.
§ 5-122 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 5-123
1:76
U.S. Army Publication Number EP 1165 2314 (June, 1972 and as
subsequently amended). Floodproofing measures, except where otherwise
noted, shall satisfy the requirements of the completely dry spaces (W1)
and essentially dry spaces (W2) classes referenced in these regulations.
In said publications where reference is made to "below" (or above) the
"RFD" (regulatory flood datum), it shall be interpreted as meaning "below
(or above) the base flood elevation."
MANUFACTURED HOME  A single family detached dwelling intended
for permanent occupancy, which may not meet local building codes but
does meet the standards of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development and appropriate Federal agencies and is certified
by them; contained in one unit or in two or more units designed to be
joined into one integral unit capable of again being separated for repeated
towing, which arrives at a site complete and ready for occupancy except for
minor and incidental unpacking and assembly operations and constructed
so that it may be used with or without a permanent foundation, including
any roofed addition such as extra rooms, covered patios, porches, etc.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction as
herein defined commenced on or after the effective date of this Part. This
term does not apply to any work on a structure existing before the effective
date of this Part.
ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD  A flood that has one chance of 100 or a
1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year. For the purposes
of this Part, this term does not apply to any work on a structure existing
before the effective date of this Part.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  The first placement of permanent
construction of a structure (other than a manufactured home) on a site,
such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of
excavation. Permanent construction does not include any preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure.
For a structure other than a manufactured home without a basement or
poured footings, the start of construction includes the first permanent
framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or
foundation. For manufactured homes not within a manufactured home park
or manufactured home subdivision, start of construction means the affixing
of the manufactured home to its permanent site. For manufactured homes
within manufactured home parks or manufactured home subdivisions, start
of construction is the date which the construction of facilities servicing
the site on which the manufactured home is to be affixed (including, at
a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads and installation of utilities) is completed.
§ 5-123 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 5-123
1:77
STRUCTURE  Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached
to the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds,
cabins, manufactured homes, modular homes and other similar items.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT 
§ 5-124. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. [Ord. 6-1996, 12/19/
1996, § 1]
Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
either:
(a) Before the improvement or repair is started; or,
If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
(b)
(1)
For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term
does not, however, include either:
Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or,
(a)
Any alteration of a structure listed on a National register of historic
places or a State inventory of historic places.
(b)
(2)
1. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Part is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
Part does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain Conservation
District or that land uses permitted within such district will be free from
flooding or flood damages.
2. This Part shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Conshohocken or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this Part or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

conference shall, in addition to considering the relevant
evidence presented at the conference, explore the possibility
that the parties may reach an amicable resolution to the

additional conference sessions if the interests of justice or the
investigative process demand additional time and/or attention

conference but has not been resolved, the Commissioner presiding

discriminatory practice has occurred. The conference report shall
be completed and circulated to the members of the Commission
within 30 days of the date of the last session of the fact finding
conference.

which dismisses a complaint as unfounded or not otherwise
indicative of an unlawful practice shall be deemed a public record

receipt by the aggrieved person of notice that the Commission has
dismissed the complaint; or 2) if no such notice is received, after one
year from the date of filing of the complaint. If the person aggrieved has
received a notice that the Commission has dismissed the complaint, an
action under this Part must be brought by the aggrieved person within

barred as untimely. Equitable principles of waiver, estoppel, and/or

contract. In conducting such inquiries, the Borough may seek relevant

responsibility determination verifying that the prospective awardee is a
qualified, responsible contractor. In the event a firm is determined to be
nonresponsible, the Borough shall proceed to conduct a responsibility
review of the next lowest responsive bidder or, if necessary, rebid the
project.

1. Findings and Purpose. The Borough finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of
spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Borough considers it to be in the interest of
the people of the Borough to provide for the establishment of a
§ 15-408 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 15-409
1:270
residential permit parking program to insure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area.
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains a bona fide occupancy at that
address.
PERMIT PARKING DISTRICT  A contiguous or nearly contiguous area
where curbside parking on public highways is limited to not more than
two consecutive hours between 6:00 a.m. until 12:00 midnight from
Monday through Friday, except on legal holidays, unless the vehicle
properly displays a parking permit authorized by the Borough;
provided, however, that when actual commercial use of property on the
ground floor level of any block of a street exceeds 50%, that block shall
be excluded from the provisions of this Chapter.
PARKING PERMIT  Either a resident parking permit or a temporary
parking permit authorized by the Borough.

worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
VEHICLE  An automobile, motorcycle, van or jeep, but does not mean
a truck, trailer or camper.
3. Designation of Districts. The Council may by resolution from time to
time designate permit parking districts when it determines that
residents of the proposed permit parking district are adversely affected
by entry into the area and curbside parking by nonresidents in motor
vehicles and/or by parking regulations in effect which are designed to
control use of curbside parking but work a hardship on area residents,
after taking into consideration the following:
A. The difficulty or inability experienced by residents of the proposed
permit parking district in obtaining curbside parking reasonably
accessible to their residences.
B. The likelihood of alleviating, by use of a permit parking system
designated pursuant to this Part, the problem of lack of available
curbside parking for residents of the permit parking district.
C. The desire of the residents of the proposed permit parking district
for the institution of a permit parking system and the willingness of
those residents to bear the costs incidental to the issuance of
§ 15-409 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 15-409
1:271
parking permits and administration of a permit parking system
authorized by this Chapter.
D. The access to the area by means of transportation other than
private vehicles.
E. The availability of off-street parking facilities.
F. The desirability of establishing a permit parking district in view of
the proportion of actual residential use to other uses in the
proposed permit parking district.
G. The resident parking permit will be valid for one year from June 1
until May 31 of the following year.
(1) Permit parking districts are to be enumerated from time to
time by Borough Council, as necessary and by resolution.
4. Posting of Signs. Upon designation by Council of a permit parking
district, the Department of Streets shall erect signs which shall be of
such a character as to inform an ordinarily observant person of the
restrictions.
5. Issuance of Resident Parking Permits.
A. Subject to the provisions of subsection (5)(B), (C), (D) and (E) of
this Section, the Borough or its designee shall issue to an applicant

application form for one resident parking permit for the vehicle
described in the application. This permit fee may be adjusted from
time to time by resolution of Borough Council.

parking permit shall be issued for a vehicle when its owner and
principal operator does not reside within the permit parking
district for which the resident parking permit is sought.

parking permit shall be issued for a vehicle when the applicant is

parking district for which a permit is sought, that he or she is the
principal operator of the motor vehicle for which a permit is
sought, and that the vehicle is either a leased vehicle or a company
car supplied to the applicant by his or her employer for general use.

1:272
F. Fees may be changed from time to time as designated by the
Borough Council by appropriate resolution.

reimbursed to him/her. Fees may be added from time to time as
designated by the Borough Council by appropriate resolution.

the permit was issued no longer fulfills one or more of the
applicable provisions of this Section, or any resolutions enacted
thereto, the holder shall surrender the parking permit in the

§ 18-111. Prohibited Discharge Standards. [Ord. 12-1992, 5/13/
1992, § 2.1; as amended by Ord. 15-2003, 12/12/2003]
1. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will cause pass through or
interference in the Authority's wastewater collection and treatment
system, will create a hazard to the environment, the general public or
Authority personnel, or will cause the Authority to violate any General
Pretreatment Regulation, NPDES permit or biosolids requirement.
These general prohibitions, apply to all such users of the POTW,
whether or not the user is subject to National categorical pretreatment
standards or any other National, State or local pretreatment standards
or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to
the POTW;
A. Explosive Matter.
(1) Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may, by sufficient either alone or my
interaction with other substances to create fire or an explosive
hazard or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the
operation of the POTW including, but not limited to, waste
streams with a closed-cup flash point of less than 140° F. (60°
C.) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
(2) At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion
hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at
any point in the system) be more than 5% nor any single
reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the
meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to,
gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers,
alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, per
chlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides.
B. Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the
flow in a sewer, or pass through or cause other interference with
the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities or collection
system, such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with particles
greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues,
paunch manure, bones, hair, hides, fleshings, entrails, whole blood,
feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, spent lime, stone or marble
dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent
grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt
residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel of lubricating
oil, and residues from grinding or polishing processes.
C. Any wastewater having a pH less than  6.0 or greater than  9.0,
or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of
§ 18-111 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 18-111
1:321
causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or
personnel of the POTW or the wastewater collection system. At the
Borough of Conshohocken Authority's discretion, an industrial user
may be permitted for a minimum pH of 5.0 and a maximum pH of
10.
D. Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or to
cause interference with any wastewater treatment process, to
constitute a hazard to the environment, humans or animals, to
create a toxic effect in the POTW or the receiving waters, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment
standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any
pollutant identified pursuant to § 307(a) of the Act.
E. Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either
singly or by interaction with other wastes, are present in sufficient
concentrations to create a public nuisance or hazard to life, cause
health and safety problems, or are sufficient to prevent entry into
the sewers for maintenance and repair.
F. Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse, or to interfere with the
reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the
POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or
disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under § 405
of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge
use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, or State criteria
applicable to the sludge management method being used.
G. Any substance which alone or in conjunction with other discharges
will cause a pass through at the POTW or cause the POTW to
violate its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards.
H. Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions.
I. Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant or collection system resulting
in interference. In no case shall wastewater have a temperature at
the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 40° C. (104° F.).
J. Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen
demanding pollutants (CBOD, BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at
a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which either singly or by
interaction with other pollutants will cause interference to the
POTW or any wastewater treatment or sludge process, or which
will constitute a hazard to humans or animals. In no case shall a
slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or quantities or
§ 18-111 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 18-111
1:322
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes
more than five times the average twenty-four-hour concentration,
quantities or flow during normal operation. This slug load provision
does not relieve the user from meeting the specific pollutant
concentrations as identified in Table 1.38
K. Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half life or concentration as may exceed limits established by
the Superintendent in compliance with applicable State or Federal
regulations.
L. Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
M. Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artisan well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate,
deionized water, noncontact cooling water and unpolluted
industrial wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the
Superintendent.
N. Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
O. Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute
worker health and safety problems.
P. Any trucked or hauled waste, except at discharge points designated
by the Authority.
Q. Any sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes.
R. Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the
Authority in a permit.
2. Grease, oil and sand interceptors (traps) shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent and/or the Authority, they are necessary
for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in
such amounts as to cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other
interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities,
or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except
such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved
by the Superintendent and the Authority and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for
the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured
material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal
which are subject to review by the Superintendent and the Authority.

release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the
user.
2. When the person furnishing a report so requests, the portions of the
report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection spection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
related to this Chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit, State disposal permit, and/or the
pretreatment programs provided. Moreover, any such portions of a
report shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will
not be recognized as confidential information.
3. Information accepted by the Authority as confidential shall not be
transmitted to the general public by the Authority until and unless a
ten-day notification is given to the user. Transmission of confidential
information from the Authority to the EPA is not governed by the tenday
notification requirement since the EPA is also required to keep this
information confidential under § 308 of the Clean Water Act.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 18-185 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 18-185
1:351

Part 1
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
§ 19-101. Purpose. [Ord. 1-2008, 3/26/2008]
§ 19-102. Site Drainage Plan. [Ord. 1-2008, 3/26/2008]
A site drainage plan for the proposed subdivision or land development tract,
which illustrates the following information, shall be prepared for review:
1. The objective of stormwater management is to prevent or mitigate the
adverse impacts related to the conveyance of excessive rates and
volumes of stormwater runoff. Further, the objectives of stormwater
management propose to maintain, as nearly as possible, natural runoff
flow characteristics, either by augmenting the infiltration process or by
temporarily storing stormwater for release at controlled rates of
discharge and/or intercepting runoff to reduce accelerated erosion and
sedimentation. Furthermore, a stormwater management system shall
be provided in order to:
A. Permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
B. Ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the lines of
streets.
C. Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals related to the
extent and grade of the area drained.
D. Provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal and
structures.
E. Remove surface water from the bottom of vertical grades, lead
water from springs and avoid excessive use of cross-gutters at
street intersections and elsewhere.
F. Ensure that the peak discharge from the development site is no
greater than prior to development.
2. See § 19-111 for additional requirements.
A. Mapping all watershed areas and floodplains in which the proposed
subdivision or land development is located.
B. Calculations of runoff for all points of runoff concentration.
C. Complete drainage systems for the subdivision or land development,
including storage facilities where required. (All existing drainage
features, which are to be incorporated in the design, shall be so
identified.)
D. Identification of all soil classifications in the watershed area.

1:353
§ 19-103. Stormwater Calculations. [Ord. 1-2008, 3/26/2008]
§ 19-104. Pipeline Design. [Ord. 1-2008, 3/26/2008]
E. Letter of approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
when drainage structures are to be located on state highway rights-ofway.
F. If the subdivision or land development is to be developed in stages, a
general drainage plan for the entire subdivision or land development
shall be presented with the first stage, and appropriate development
stages for the drainage system shall be indicated, in accordance with
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Rules and
Regulations, Title 25, Chapter 102, as last revised.
1. All storm sewer design shall be based on the Rational Formula:
Q = CiA
Where:
Q = Rate of flow in cubic feet per second.
C = Runoff coefficient.
I = Intensity of rainfall in inches per hour.
A = Watershed area in acres.
2. In setting the value of the runoff coefficient "C," consideration will be
given to the physical features of the drainage basin and the best
available data on the future density of development of the drainage
basin. The value chosen should conform to percentage of runoff vs. total
rainfall as determined by the Soil Cover Complex Method, which will be
further discussed under detention pond design criteria.
3. The intensity of the storm shall be based on a one-hundred-yearfrequency
storm with the inlet time of concentration equal to the storm
duration for any given point. The inlet time of concentration may be
determined by any standard engineering method.
4. The Rainfall-Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curve for Philadelphia
presented in Technical Paper No. 25, prepared by United States
Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, shall be used.
1. All storm sewer pipelines shall be reinforced concrete pipe, or
equivalent, and shall be designed by either of the following two
methods. Both shall be based on the Manning Equation and shall utilize
the "n" factor of 0.015. The minimum allowable pipe size is 18 inches.
A. Pipeline submerged.
(1) This method is based on the assumption that when the storm
sewer system is under maximum load, the hydraulic gradient
will be at or above the crown of the pipe and that flow in the
§ 19-102 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 19-104
1:354
lines will be controlled by head differentials between
structures or other locations where the system is open to the
ground surface, such as inlets or outlets, manholes and stream
inlets and outlets. The head of water above the crown of any
pipe can range from zero feet to a point which will not cause
surface flooding.
(2) The slope of the hydraulic gradient in any section of storm
sewer between openings to the surface shall be calculated on
the assumption that the pipe is flowing full at a constant
velocity and at the required capacity.
(3) The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point in the pipe
shall be no lower than the crown of the pipe and no higher than
the surface of the ground.
(4) The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point where the
system opens to the surface, such as an inlet or manhole, shall
be three feet six inches below the surface of the ground.
(5) At all structures, such as manholes, inlets, etc., where the pipe
size does not change, the elevation of the hydraulic gradient
shall be dropped 0.2 of a foot to allow for losses therein. Where
the inlet and outlet pipe sizes are not the same, the elevation of
the hydraulic gradient shall be dropped an amount based on
the following formula:
H = 0.2 feet + 0.8 (D1  D2)
Where:
D1 = Diameter of inlet pipe.
D2 = Diameter of outlet pipe.
If D1 is larger than D2, head loss = 0.2 feet
(6) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum
velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be maintained when the
pipe is flowing 1/4 full.
B. Pipeline flowing full.
(1) This method is based on the assumption that the hydraulic
gradient will match the inside top of the pipe when the system
is under maximum hydraulic load.
(2) For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets, etc.,
shall be ignored.
(3) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum
velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be maintained when the
pipe is flowing 1/4 full.
§ 19-104 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 19-104
1:355
(4) When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes shall
be matched.
2. Profile requirements. Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe shall be
plotted along with the hydraulic information pertinent to each reach
within the system. This information shall include the pipe size and type,
the "n" factor, the slope of the pipe, the design capacity and the velocity
at the design capacity.
3. Endwalls. Standard Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
endwalls shall be installed on all influent and effluent pipes.
4. Inlets.
A. Inlets conforming to PennDOT standards shall be utilized in all
applications. The type to be used shall depend on the particular
application.
B. Sufficient inlets shall be located and constructed so as to collect all
of the flow in the contributory drainage area. In roadways, the
inlets shall be spaced to allow a maximum gutter flow of 4.0 cubic
feet per second. Calculations of inlet capacities shall be in
accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Guidelines.
C. The gutter of all inlets shall be set not less than two inches, nor
more than four inches, below the gutter grade. The surface of the
paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend into the
lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that sudden
dropoff or dip at the inlet will not be created.
D. Where surface water is collected from two directions at one street
corner, inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent points of both
ends of the radius. The use of an inlet in the radius shall not be
allowed.
5. Manholes. Manholes shall be located at intervals of approximately 400
feet where pipe sizes of 24 inches or less are used and 600 feet apart for
larger sizes. Inlets should be substituted for manholes where they will
serve a useful purpose. Manholes or inlets shall be placed at all changes
of direction.
6. Open channel design. Open channel design should be based on the
following hydraulic considerations:
A. Manning's Equation:
(1) To determine "n" factor:
n = 0.015 for best concrete-lined ditch.
n = 0.025 for best unlined ditch.
§ 19-104 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 19-104
1:356
n = 0.03 to 0.15 for fair to poor natural streams and
watercourses.
(2) Allowable velocities:
Excavation
Material
Allowable Velocity
(feet per second)
Fine sand and
firm loam
2.50 to 3.5
Stiff clay and
hardpan
3.75 to 6.0
Concrete-lined
ditch
15
B. A minimum one-foot to zero-foot freeboard should be provided on
all channels at one-hundred-year storm flows.
C. The channel should be designed to conform, wherever possible, to
the adjacent average ground conditions. This means that it should
not be projecting excessively above the surrounding ground or
placed excessively below the surrounding ground.
D. Continuous profiles for each reach of open channel shall be plotted
along with the adjacent ground and the hydraulic information
pertinent to each reach within the system. This information shall
include the type of channel lining, the "n" factor, the width of the
channel bottom, the side slopes, the water depth, the design
capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
E. Open channels shall have a maximum side slope of three to one and
shall have adequate slope protection as required by the Borough
Engineer.
F. No open watercourses shall be permitted within the right-of-way of
any street.
7. Bridges and culverts. Single-opening culverts are desirable. The design
of culverts shall be such as to minimize the probability of debris
accumulation. Bridges and culverts shall be designed to meet current
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards to support
expected loads and carry expected flows. They shall be constructed for
the full right-of-way.
8. Permit requirements. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Bureau of Water Quality Management, Division of Dams and
Encroachments, requires a permit for construction or changes in a
watercourse which drains an area of more than 1/2 square mile. No
open watercourses shall be permitted within the rights-of-way of any
streets.
§ 19-104 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 19-104
1:357
9. Location of sewers. Wherever practicable, storm sewers shall be
located behind the curb and within the right-of-way of the street. They
shall be protected by a cover of at least 18 inches.
10. Change in direction. In lieu of manholes or inlets, special concrete pipe
sections with a minimum radius of 10 times the inside pipe diameter
may be used where changes are made in direction.
11. Stormwater roof drains. Stormwater roof drains and pipes immediately
adjacent to a sidewalk shall not discharge water over a sidewalk but
shall extend under the sidewalk to the gutter. Where accessible, the
roof drain shall be connected with the storm drainage system of the
Borough.
12. Detention facilities.
A. Storage requirements.
(1) Whenever an increase in runoff will occur as the result of
development, the developer will be required to provide
permanent stormwater management facilities to attain zero
increase in runoff. The storage requirements of all stormwater
management facilities shall be computed in accordance with
the Soil Cover Complex Method and must be submitted to the
Borough Engineer for review and, when required, to the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or the
United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service.
(2) It should be noted that, in addition to the permanent storage
facilities, the developer must provide adequate erosion and
sedimentation control measures in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Clean Stream Act and Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection Rules and Regulations, Title 25,
Chapter 102, as last revised.
(3) The volume of storage provided shall equal the total additional
volume of runoff due to development based on a one-hundredyear-
frequency twenty-four-hour-duration storm. The storage
required may be based on "after" construction flows rather
than "during," provided that the development is properly
staged or other measures are taken to retard the higher
"during" construction flows. An additional storage allowance of
0.06 acre-inches must be provided to compensate for sediment
accumulation.
B. Discharge piping.
(1) Discharge piping shall be reinforced concrete pipe and shall be
sized to maximize use and efficiency of the storage provided.
Specifically, the most critical duration one-hundred-year storm
should fill the storage facility to the spillway level without
§ 19-104 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 19-104
1:358
utilizing the spillway. In no case shall the spillway be utilized in
the design routing of one-hundred-year storms.
(2) The sizing of the discharge piping will therefore require
detailed analysis rather than a random sizing correlating to a
"before" construction standard frequency storm, such as a tenyear
storm. The design engineer's submittal to the Borough
must include calculations on the methodology of sizing the
piping. The capacity of all discharge piping shall be based on
"inlet control" or, where conditions warrant, "outlet control."
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Bureau of
Suburban Roads and Soil Conservation Service may be utilized
for this.
(3) Once the discharge piping is sized, a storage vs. elevation vs.
discharge curve should be prepared and included with the
submittal, along with a routing of the most critical onehundred-
year storm. Both ends of the discharge piping shall be
provided with headwalls.
(4) Erosion protection shall be provided in the form of riprap or
other acceptable means where required by the Borough
Engineer.
(5) Antiseep collars shall be provided for all discharge pipes. The
collars shall be a minimum of six inches thick and shall extend
a minimum of two feet in all directions from the outside walls
of the pipe.
C. Emergency spillway.
(1) A concrete-lined emergency spillway shall be provided for all
storage facilities. Although the storage facility is designed so
that the spillway will not be used in a one-hundred-year storm,
the possibility exists whereby the outlet pipe could be totally
blocked during a storm. For this reason, it is required that the
spillway be sized to accommodate the peak flow rate into the
pond when the pond would be completely full during a onehundred-
year storm, assuming a totally blocked discharge
pipe.
(2) The spillway capacity should be calculated by the formula:
Q = 3.087 x  v D3 x L
Where:
Q =Capacity in cubic feet per second.
D =Depth of spillway in feet.
L =Length of spillway in feet.
(3) The minimum depth of spillway shall be two feet.

§ 19-105. Land Development Plan Requirements. [Ord. 1-2008, 3/
26/2008]
The following items, where appropriate and/or as required in the Borough
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22], shall be
included in the plan:
D. Storage area.
(1) Side slopes in storage areas shall be no steeper than three to
one. Every effort should be made to blend the storage area into
the natural topography of its surroundings.
(2) The bed of the storage area shall slope towards the discharge
pipe from all directions at a minimum slope of 1%.
(3) Prior to grading in the storage area, the topsoil shall be
stripped and stockpiled. Upon completion of grading, the
topsoil shall be redistributed over the storage area (minimum
four inches thick). The area should then be seeded with a
mixture approved by the Borough Engineer.
(4) All fill material to be utilized in embankment areas shall be
selected from the more-impervious materials available at the
site and shall be compacted to a minimum of 95% of the
material's maximum dry density as determined by a Standard
Proctor Test. Where necessary, embankment fill materials shall
be keyed into virgin soil. Where embankment berms are used,
a minimum ten-foot-wide flat area shall be provided at the top
of the berm (sieve analysis required accompanying
submission).
(5) The responsibility for the continued maintenance and
operation of the retention facility shall be the obligation of the
property owner or Borough, whichever is applicable. A fence
four feet in height with a self-closing gate surrounding the
retention basin may be required as directed by the Code
Enforcement Officer or the Borough Engineer.
(6) All storage areas must be located outside of the one-hundredyear
floodplain as indicated on the Borough floodplain
mapping.
(7) Underground storage beds will be given consideration in lieu
of conventional storage facilities.
A. General: prepare a narrative to include a description of the project,
erosion and sedimentation control, stormwater control, both during and
after construction, and expected project schedules.
B. Specific plan requirements: location plan, two-foot existing and
proposed contour intervals, all bodies of water, all physical features, all

Subdivision and Land Development Regulations.
C. Erosion and sedimentation controls: stormwater management controls
and maintenance programs.
D. Easements. Drainage easements may be required along natural
watercourses to a maximum width of 15 feet from the center line and
may be used for storm and sanitary sewers and as open space. Where
conditions warrant, such as in floodplains, additional width may be
required in such cases where runoff treatment requires a wider
easement. Runoff studies must prove such requirements beyond the
floodplain.
1. By private entity. An agreement is required between Conshohocken

(b) Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the separate storm sewer system which
has not been documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records
and approved by the Borough.
B. Requirement for erosion and sediment controls.
§ 19-111 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 19-111
1:363
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities.
(2) The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more,
under 25 Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
(3) In addition, under 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES
construction activities permit is required for any earth disturbance
one acre or more with a point-source discharge to surface waters or
the Borough's storm sewer system, or five acres or more regardless
of the planned runoff (hereinafter collectively referred to as
"regulated earth disturbance activities"). This includes earth
disturbance on any portion of, part of or during any stage of a
larger common plan of development.
(4) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or
County Conservation District must be provided to the Borough. The
issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage
under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the
requirements of Subsection A.
(5) A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the
project site at all times.
C. Postconstruction stormwater runoff controls for new development and
redevelopment, including operations and maintenance of stormwater
BMPs.
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements
after construction is complete.
(2) The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses
(e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery use) and maintain the
level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code,
Chapter 93 (collectively referred to herein as "state water quality
requirements").
(3) To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated
earth disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can
be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff
conditions, so that post-construction stormwater discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the

Stormwater Management Policy (No. 392-0300-002, September 28,
2002), this may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration. Replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
(b) Treatment. Use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff; and
(c) Streambank and streambed protection. Management of
volume and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to
prevent physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from
scouring and erosion).
(4) The DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure
design, implementation and maintenance of best management
practices ("BMPs") that control runoff from new development and
redevelopment (hereinafter "development") after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete. These requirements include
the need to implement postconstruction stormwater BMPs with
assurance of longterm operations and maintenance of those BMPs.
(5) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or
County Conservation District must be provided to the Borough. The
issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage
under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the
requirements of Subsection A.
1. The violation of any provision of this Part is hereby deemed a public
nuisance.
2. Whenever the Borough finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this Part, the Borough may order
compliance by written notice to the responsible person. Such notice
may require, without limitation:
A. The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
B. The elimination of prohibited discharges;
C. Cessation of any violating discharges, practices, or operations;
D. The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;

dwelling units and which is not attached to any other building. A twofamily
building counts as two dwelling units for density purposes.
TWIN (SINGLE-FAMILY SEMI-DETACHED)  A two-family
building with dwelling units placed side-by-side, and joined to each
other by a vertical, common party wall, but otherwise surrounded
by yard areas. When lotted, each dwelling unit may be on a
separate lot, with the common boundary between the two lots
running along the common party wall. Separate ingress and egress
is provided to each unit.

having its own independent outside access, with no other dwelling
units located directly and totally above or below it, and having party
walls in common with at least one but not more than three adjacent
similar dwelling units, and located in a building comprised of at least
three dwelling units. Each dwelling unit may be individually lotted, or
owned as a condominium. This dwelling type shall include, but not be
limited to, dwelling units commonly known as townhouses, row houses,
triplexes, quadruplexes, and multiplexes.
TOWNHOUSE (ROW HOUSE)  A single-family attached dwelling
in a row of at least three units, with one dwelling unit from ground
to roof, with individual outside access. Although these units are in
rows, their design should de-emphasize a "lined up" appearance.
(1)
MULTIPLEX  An attached dwelling arranged in a group of no
more than six units, in a variety of configurations: side by side,
back to back, or vertically. Because of the variety of configurations,
a multiplex can be designed to look like a large, single-family

adequacy of subdivision and land development proposals. The
standards included in these regulations are minimum design
requirements. The Borough Council reserves the right in any case to
request that development features exceed these standards if conditions
so warrant.
F. The Borough Council may modify or adjust the standards to permit
reasonable utilization of property while securing substantial
conformance with the objectives of the regulations.
1. In addition to reviewing subdivision or land development plans to
determine conformity with these regulations, the governing body may
request that the Borough Planning Commission determine the
adequacy of existing and proposed community facilities to serve the
additional development proposed by the subdivision or land
development proposal.

8. Lot Numbers. For the purpose of development, each subdivision may
have an overall system of lot numbers, the number one being assigned
to a lot in the first section to be developed. (Such system of lot numbers
shall not be confused with the regular house or building numbering
system based on a Borough-wide plan.)
9. Building Numbers. House or building numbers shall be assigned by the
municipality based on an overall street plan. Numbers will be assigned
in such a way as to allow for vacant parcels and future development.
A. If structure(s) is to remain:
(1) In residential zoning districts of the Borough, the lot and lot
dimensions of the newly created lot containing the structure(s)
must be consistent with the height and bulk of the structure, even if
this requires a lot area and/or dimensions exceeding the minimum
zoning requirement for that district.
(2) In cases where the principal building use has not been as a
dwelling, its conversion to a dwelling shall comply with all of the
requirements of the Borough Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] and
the Building Code [Chapter 5].
B. If existing structure(s) is to be removed: Subdivision or land
development approval will be issued upon the condition of the
§ 22-407 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-408
1:461
§ 22-409. Grading. [Ord. 7-2005, 7/13/2005]
§ 22-410. Drainage. [Ord. 7-2005, 7/13/2005; as amended by Ord.
9-2008, 12/17/2008]
expeditious removal of existing structures in complete conformity to all
other Borough procedural requirements. In commercial and industrial
areas, plots of land that have been cleared, as well as the existing
vacant portions of such lands, should be developed in conformity with
the long-range needs of the area to the extent possible and all
developmental requirements embodied in the Building Code [Chapter
5] and zoning regulations shall be adhered to.
C. If existing structure is to be replaced or is to be added on to: Demolition
plans and/or construction plans must be detailed as part of the
subdivision or land development plan review and subsequent plan
approval will be conditional upon compliance with said proposed
details. Renovation work to the remaining portion of a structure
following partial demolition must be completed promptly and
expeditiously.

mitigate the adverse impacts related to the conveyance of excessive
§ 22-408 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-410
1:462
rates and volumes of stormwater runoff. Further, the objectives of
stormwater management propose to maintain, as nearly as possible,
natural runoff flow characteristics, either by augmenting the infiltration
process or by temporarily storing stormwater for release at controlled
rates of discharge and/or intercepting runoff to reduce accelerated
erosion and sedimentation. Furthermore, a stormwater management
system shall be provided in order to:
A. Permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
B. Ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the lines of
streets.
C. Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals related to the
extent and grade of the area drained.
D. Provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal and
structures.
E. Remove surface water from the bottom of vertical grades, lead
water from springs and avoid excessive use of cross-gutters at
street intersections and elsewhere.
F. Ensure that the peak discharge from the development site is no
greater than prior to development.
G. See subsection (12) for additional requirements.
2. Site drainage plan. A site drainage plan for the proposed subdivision or
land development tract, which illustrates the following information,
shall be prepared for review.
A. Mapping all watershed areas and floodplains in which the proposed
subdivision or land development is located.
B. Calculations of runoff for all points of runoff concentration.
C. Complete drainage systems for the subdivision or land
development, including storage facilities where required. (All
existing drainage features, which are to be incorporated in design,
shall be so identified.)
D. Identification of all soil classifications in the watershed area.
E. Letter of approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation when drainage structures are to be located on state
highway rights-of-way.
F. If the subdivision or land development is to be developed in stages,
a general drainage plan for the entire subdivision or land
development shall be presented with the first stage, and
appropriate development stages for the drainage system shall be
indicated, in accordance with Pennsylvania Department of
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:463
Environmental Protection's Rules and Regulations, Title 25,
Chapter 102, as last revised.
3. Stormwater calculations.
A. All storm sewer design shall be based on the rational formula:
Q = CiA
Where:
Q = Rate of flow in cubic feet per second.
C = Runoff coefficient.
I = Intensity of rainfall in inches per hour.
A = Watershed area in acres.
B. In setting the value of the runoff coefficient "C," consideration will
be given to the physical features of the drainage basin and the best
available data on the future density of development of the drainage
basin. The value chosen should conform to percentage of runoff
versus total rainfall as determined by the Soil Cover Complete
Method, which will be further discussed under detention pond
design criteria.
C. The intensity of the storm shall be based on a one-hundred-year
frequency storm with the inlet time of concentration equal to the
storm duration for any given point. The inlet time of concentration
may be determined by any standard engineering method.
D. The Rainfall-Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curve for Philadelphia
presented in Technical Paper No. 25, prepared by United States
Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, shall be used.
4. Pipeline design.
A. All storm sewer pipelines shall be reinforced concrete pipe, or
equivalent, and shall be designed by either of the following two
methods. Both shall be based on the Manning equation and shall
utilize the "n" factor of 0.015. The minimum allowable pipe size is
18 inches.
(1) Pipeline submerged.
(a) This method is based on the assumption that when the
storm sewer system is under maximum load hydraulic
gradient will be at or above the crown of the pipe and that
flow in the lines will be controlled by head differentials
between structures or other locations where the system is
open to the ground surface, such as inlets or outlets,
manholes and stream inlets and outlets. The head of water
above the crown of any pipe can range from zero feet to a
point, which will not cause surface flooding.
§ 22-410 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-410
1:464
(b) The slope of the hydraulic gradient in any section of storm
sewer between openings to the surface shall be calculated
on the assumption that the pipe is flowing full at a constant
velocity and at the required capacity.
(c) The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point in the
pipe shall be no lower than the crown of the pipe and no
higher than the surface of the ground.
(d) The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point where
the systems opens to the surface, such as an inlet or
manhole, shall be three feet six inches below the surface of
the ground.
(e) At all structures, such as manholes, inlets, etc., where the
pipe size does not change, the elevation of the hydraulic
gradient shall be dropped 0.2 of a foot to allow for losses
therein. Where the inlet and outlet pipe sizes are not the
same, the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be
dropped an amount based on the following formula:
H = 0.2 feet + 0.8 (D1  D2)
Where:
D1 = Diameter of inlet pipe.
D2 = Diameter of outlet pipe.
If D1 is larger than D2, head loss = 0.2 feet
(f) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a
minimum velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be
maintained when the pipe is flowing 1/4 full.
(2) Pipeline flowing full.
(a) This method is based on the assumption that the hydraulic
gradient will match the inside top of the pipe when the
system is under maximum hydraulic load.
(b) For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets,
etc., shall be ignored.
(c) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a
minimum velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be
maintained when the pipe is flowing 1/4 full.
(d) When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes
shall be matched.
B. Profile requirements. Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe
shall be plotted along with the hydraulic information pertinent to
each reach within the system. This information shall include the
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:465
pipe size and type, the "n" factor, slope of the pipe, the design
capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
C. Endwalls. Standard Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
endwalls shall be installed on all influent and effluent pipes.
D. Inlets.
(1) Inlets conforming to PennDOT standards shall be utilized in all
applications. The type to be used shall depend on the particular
application.
(2) Sufficient inlets shall be located and constructed so as to
collect all of the flow in the contributory drainage area. In
roadways the inlets shall be spaced to allow a maximum gutter
flow of 4.0 cubic feet per second. Calculations of inlet
capacities shall be in accordance with Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Guidelines.
(3) The gutter of all inlets shall be set not less than two inches, or
more than four inches, below the gutter grade. The surface of
the paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend
into the lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that
sudden dropoff or dip at the inlet will not be created.
(4) Where surface water is collected from two directions at one
street corner, inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent
points of both ends of the radius. The use of an inlet in the
radius shall not be allowed.
E. Manholes. Manholes shall be located at intervals of approximately
400 feet where pipe sizes of 24 inches or less are used, and 600 feet
apart for larger sizes. Inlets should be substituted for manholes
where they will serve a useful purpose. Manholes or inlets shall be
placed at all changes of direction.
F. Open channel design. Open channel design should be based on the
following hydraulic considerations:
(1) Mannings equations:
(a) To determine "n" factor:
n = 0.015 for best concrete lined ditch.
n = 0.025 for best unlined ditch.
n = .003 to 0.15 for fair to poor natural streams and

(2) Minimum one foot to zero feet freeboard should be provided on
all channels at one-hundred-year storm flows.
(3) The channel should be designed to conform, wherever
possible, to the adjacent average ground conditions. This
means that it should not be projecting excessively above the
surrounding ground or placed excessively below the
surrounding ground.
(4) Continuous profiles for each reach of open channel shall be
plotted along with the adjacent ground and the hydraulic
information pertinent to each reach within the system. This
information shall include the type of channel lining, the "n"
factor, the width of the channel bottom, the side slopes, the
water depth, the design capacity and the velocity at the design
capacity.
(5) Open channels shall have a maximum side slope of three to one
and shall have adequate slope protection as required by the
Borough Engineer.
(6) No open watercourses shall be permitted within the right-ofway
of any street.
G. Bridges and culverts. Single opening culverts are desirable. The
design of culverts shall be such as to minimize the probability of
debris accumulation. Bridges and culverts shall be designed to
meet current Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
standards to support expected loads and carry expected flows.
They shall be constructed for the full right-of-way.
H. Permit requirements. The Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection Bureau of Water Quality Management,
Division of Dams and Encroachments requires a permit for
construction or changes in a watercourse which drains an area of
more than 1/2 square mile. No open watercourses shall be
permitted within the rights-of-way of any streets.
I. Location of sewers. Wherever practicable, storm sewers shall be
located behind the curb and within the right-of-way of the street.
They shall be protected by a cover of at least 18 inches.
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:467
J. Change in direction. In lieu of manholes or inlets, special concrete
pipe sections with a minimum radius of 10 times the inside pipe
diameter may be used where changes are made in direction.
K. Stormwater roof drains. All roof drains from new development or
redevelopment shall be discharged to an infiltration system or
other Best Management Practice (BMPs). Roof drain systems shall
be submitted to the Borough Engineer for approval.
L. Detention facilities.
(1) Storage requirements.
(a) Whenever an increase in runoff will occur as the result of
development, the developer will be required to provide
permanent stormwater management facilities to attain
zero increase in runoff. The storage requirements of all
stormwater management facilities shall be computed in
accordance with the Soil Cover Complex Method and must
be submitted to the Borough Engineer for review and,
when required, to the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection or the United States
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service.
(b) It should be noted that in addition to the permanent
storage facilities, the developer must provide adequate
erosion and sedimentation control measures in accordance
with the Pennsylvania Clean Stream Act, and Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection Rules and
Regulations, Title 25, Chapter 102, as last revised.
(c) The volume of storage provided shall equal the total
additional volume of runoff due to development based on a
one-hundred-year frequency twenty-four-hour duration
storm. The storage required may be based on "after"
construction flows rather than "during," provided that the
development is properly staged or other measures are
taken to retard the higher "during" construction flows. An
additional storage allowance of 0.06-acre inches must be
provided to compensate for sediment accumulation.
(2) Discharge piping.
(a) Discharged piping shall be reinforced concrete pipe and
shall be sized to maximize use and efficiency of the storage
provided. Specifically, the most critical duration onehundred-
year storm should fill the storage facility to the
spillway level without utilizing the spillway. In no case
shall the spillway be utilized in the design routing of onehundred-
year storms.
§ 22-410 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-410
1:468
(b) The sizing of the discharge piping will therefore require
detailed analysis rather than a random sizing correlating
to a "before" construction standard frequency storm, such
as a ten-year storm. The design engineer's submittal to the
Borough must include calculations on the methodology of
sizing the piping. The capacity of all discharge piping shall
be based on inlet control or, where conditions warrant,
outlet control. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Bureau of Suburban Roads and Soil Conservation Service
may be utilized for this.
(c) Once the discharge piping is sized, a storage versus
elevation versus discharge curve should be prepared and
included with the submittal, along with a routing of the
most critical one-hundred-year storm. Both ends of the
discharge piping shall be provided with headwalls.
(d) Erosion protection shall be provided in the form of riprap
or other acceptable means where required by the Borough
Engineer.
(e) Antiseep collars shall be provided for all discharge pipes.
The collars shall be a minimum of six inches thick and shall
extend a minimum of two feet in all directions from the
outside walls of the pipe.
(3) Emergency spillway.
(a) A concrete lined emergency spillway shall be provided for
all storage facilities. Although the storage facility is
designed so that the spillway will not be used in a onehundred-
year storm, the possibility exists whereby the
outlet pipe could be totally blocked during a storm. For
this reason it is required that the spillway be sized to
accommodate the peak flow rate into the pond when the
pond would be completely full during a one-hundred-year
storm assuming a totally blocked discharge pipe.
(b) The spillway capacity should be calculated by the formula:
Q = 3.087 x v D3 x L
Where:
Q = Capacity in cubic feet per second.
D = Depth of spillway in feet.
L = Length of spillway in feet.
(c) The minimum depth of spillway shall be two feet.
(4) Storage area.
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:469
(a) Side slopes in storage areas shall be no steeper than three
to one. Every effect should be made to blend the storage
area into the natural topography of its surroundings.
(b) The bed of the storage area shall slope towards the
discharge pipe from all directions at a minimum slope of
1%.
(c) Prior to grading in the storage area, the topsoil shall be
stripped and stockpiled. Upon completion of grading, the
topsoil shall be redistributed over the storage area
(minimum four inches thick). The area should then be
seeded with a mixture approved by the Borough Engineer.
(d) All fill material to be utilized in embankment areas shall be
selected from the more impervious materials available at
the site and shall be compacted to a minimum of 95% of
the materials maximum dry density as determined by a
Standard Proctor Test. Where necessary, embankment fill
materials shall be keyed into virgin soil. Where
embankment berms are used, a minimum ten-foot-wide
flat area shall be provided at the top of the berm. (Sieve
analysis required accompanying submission.)
(e) The responsibility for the continued maintenance and
operation of the retention facility shall be the obligation of
the property owner or Borough whichever is applicable. A
fence four feet in height with a self-closing gate
surrounding the retention basin may be required as
directed by the Code Enforcement or the Borough
Engineer.
(f) All storage areas must be located outside of the onehundred-
year floodplain as indicated on the Borough
floodplain mapping.
(g) Underground storage beds will be given consideration in
lieu of conventional storage facilities.
5. Land Development Plan Requirements. The following items, where
appropriate, shall be included in the plan:
A. General: prepare a narrative to include a description of the project,
erosion and sedimentation control, stormwater control, both during
and after construction, expected project schedules.
B. Specific plan requirements: location plan, two-foot existing and
proposed contour interval, all bodies of water, all physical features,
all underground utilities, soil overlay, proposed changes to land
surface and vegetative cover, areas to be cut and filled, or as
required by subdivision and land development regulations.
§ 22-410 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-410
1:470
C. Erosion and sedimentation controls: stormwater management
controls and maintenance programs.
D. Easements: drainage easements may be required along natural
watercourses to a maximum width of 15 feet from the center line
and may be used for storm and sanitary sewers, and as open space.
Where conditions warrant, such as in floodplains, additional width
may be required in such cases where runoff treatment requires a
wider easement. Runoff studies must prove such requirements
beyond the floodplain.
6. Maintenance of stormwater facilities.
A. By private entity: agreement required between Conshohocken
Borough and private entity providing maintenance of all permanent
control facilities.
B. By individual lot owners: facility description and terms of
maintenance and incorporated as part of deed to property.
7. Applicability. The following activities are included within the scope of
this Chapter:
A. Land development.
B. Subdivision.
C. All sites of 0.5 acres or more.
D. Agricultural operations.
E. Construction of new or additional impervious or semi-pervious
surfaces.
F. Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
G. Nursery operations.
H. Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
8. Inspections. The duly appointed engineer for Conshohocken Borough or
its designee shall inspect all phases of development of the site,
including but not limited to:
A. Preliminary site preparation.
B. Rough grading.
C. Permanent stormatic facilities.
D. Establishment of ground covers.
E. All restoration work.
9. Fees. All costs for implementation of stormwater management facilities
shall be the responsibility of the person or persons developing and/or
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:471
owning the subdivision plans submitted to the Borough of
Conshohocken for review.
10. Violations and penalties. Anyone violating the provisions of this Section
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject
to a fine of not more than $1,000 for each violation, recoverable with
costs, or imprisonment of not more than 30 days, or both. Each day that
the violation continues shall be a separate offense.
11. Conflicts with other provisions. Permits and approvals issued pursuant
to this Section do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance. If more stringent
requirements concerning regulation of stormwater or erosion and
sedimentation control are contained in the other code, rule, act or
ordinance, the more stringent regulation shall apply.
12. DEP NPDES Requirements. The following shall apply as indicated or if
more stringent requirements concerning regulation of stormwater or
erosion and sedimentation control are contained in any other code,
rule, act or ordinance adopted by the Borough of Conshohocken, the
more stringent regulation shall apply.
A. Prohibition Against Non-Stormwater Discharges.
(1) Prohibited Discharges.
(a) No person in the Borough shall allow, or cause to allow,
stormwater discharges into the Borough's separate storm
sewer system which are not composed entirely of
stormwater, except (1) as provided in subsection
(12)(A)(1)(b) below, and (2) discharges allowed under a
state or federal permit.
(b) Discharges which may be allowed, based on a finding by
the Borough that the discharge(s) do not significantly
contribute to pollution to surface waters of the
Commonwealth are:
1) Discharges from fire-fighting activities.
2) Uncontaminated water from foundation or from
footing drains.
3) Potable water sources including dechlorinated
waterline and fire hydrant flushings.
4) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.
5) Lawn watering.
6) Irrigation drainage.
§ 22-410 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-410
1:472
7) Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill
material has been removed) and where detergents are
not used.
8) Routine external building wash down (which does not
use detergents or other compounds).
9) Air-conditioning condensate.
10) Water from individual residential car washing.
11) Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges.
12) Springs.
13) Uncontaminated groundwater.
14) Water from crawl space pumps.
(c) In the event that the Borough determines that any of the
discharges identified in subsection (12)(A)(1)(b)
significantly contributes to pollution of waters of the
Commonwealth, or is so notified by DEP, the Borough will
notify the responsible person to cease the discharge.
(d) Upon notice provided by the Borough under subsection
(12)(A)(1)(c), the discharger will have a reasonable time,
as determined by the Borough, to cease the discharge
consistent with the degree of pollution caused by the
discharge.
(e) Nothing in this Section shall affect a discharger's
responsibilities under state law.
(2) Prohibited Discharges or Connections. The following
connections are prohibited, except as provided in subsection
(12)(A)(1)(b) above:
(a) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows any non-stormwater discharge
including sewage, process wastewater and wash water, to
enter the separate storm sewer system, and any
connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains
and sinks; and
(b) Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the separate storm sewer system
which has not been documented in plans, maps or
equivalent records, and approved by the Borough.
B. Requirement for Erosion and Sediment Controls.
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:473
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough
shall commence until approval by the Borough of an Erosion
and Sediment Control Plan for construction activities.
(2) The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) has regulations that require an Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square
feet or more, under 25 Pa. Code § 102.4(b). The applicant is
required to meet these regulations.
(3) In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES
construction activities permit is required for any earth
disturbance one acre or more with a point source discharge to
surface waters or the Borough's storm sewer system, or five
acres or more regardless of the planned runoff (hereinafter
collectively referred to as "regulated earth disturbance
activities"). This Includes earth disturbance on any portion of,
part of or during any stage of, a larger common plan of
development.
(4) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office
or County Conservation District must be provided to the
Borough. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)]
satisfies the requirements of subsection (12)(B)(1).
(5) A copy of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and any
required permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be
available at the project site at all times.
C. Post-Construction Stormwater Runoff Controls for New
Development and Redevelopment, Including Operations and
Maintenance of Stormwater BMPs.
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough
shall commence until approval by the Borough of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality
requirements after construction is complete.
(2) The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing
uses (e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery use) and
maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality
in special protection streams, as required by statewide
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 (collectively referred to
herein as "state water quality requirements").
(3) To control post-construction stormwater impacts from
regulated earth disturbance activities, state water quality
requirements shall be met to the maximum extent practicable
by BMPs, including site design, which provide or replication of
§ 22-410 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-410
1:474
pre-construction stormwater infiltration and runoff not
degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of
the receiving waters. As described in the DEP Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Policy (#392-0300-002, September
28, 2002), this may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration: replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
(b) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants from the
stormwater runoff; and
(c) Streambank and Streambed Protection: management of
volume and rate of post-construction stormwater
discharges to prevent physical degradation of receiving
waters (e.g., from scouring and erosion).
(d) Refer also to Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Handbook of
Best Management Practices for Developing Areas, latest
edition.
(4) DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure
design, implementation and maintenance of best management
practices ("BMPs") that control runoff from new development
and redevelopment (hereinafter "development") after
regulated earth disturbance activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement post-construction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of longterm operations and
maintenance of those BMPs. The applicant is required to meet
these regulations by submission of BMPs to the Borough
Engineer for approval.
(5) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office
or County Conservation District must be provided to the
Borough. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)]
satisfies the requirements subsection (12)(B)(1).
D. Sanctions.
(1) Public Nuisance.
(a) The violation of any provision of this Chapter is hereby
deemed a public nuisance.
(b) Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.
(2) Enforcement.
§ 22-410 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-410
1:475
(a) Whenever the Borough finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this Section,
the Borough may order compliance by written notice to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without
limitation:

reporting;
2) The elimination of prohibited discharges;
3) Cessation of any violating discharges, practices or
operations;
4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution
or contamination hazards and the restoration of any
affected property;
5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and
remediation costs;
6) The implementation of stormwater BMPs; and
7) Operation and maintenance of stormwater BMPs.
(b) Failure to comply within the time specified shall also
subject such person to the penalty provisions of this
Section. All such penalties shall be deemed cumulative and
shall not prevent the Borough from pursuing any and all
other remedies available in law or equity.
(3) Suspension and Revocation of Permits and Approvals. Any
building, land development or other permit or approval for
regulated earth disturbance activities issued by the Borough
may be suspended or revoked by the governing body for:
(a) Noncompliance with or failure to implement any provision
of the permit,
(b) A violation of any provision of this Section; or
(c) The creation of any condition or the commission of any act
during construction or development which constitutes or
creates a hazard or nuisance, pollution or which
endangers the life or property of others.
(4) Penalties.
(a) Any person violating the provisions of this Section shall be
subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 for each violation,
recoverable with costs. Each day that the violation
continues shall constitute as separate offense and the
applicable fines are cumulative.

3. Proposed water systems shall be subject to the review and approval of
the utility provider and the Borough Engineer.
1. Any development which creates a significant change in the
characteristics of the watershed, thus increasing volume and velocity of
surface water runoff, due to the decrease in retention and infiltration of
stormwater, shall not be permitted until guarantees are made of
improvements that will reduce the likelihood of erosion, sedimentation,
inundation, and water drainage from peak periods of precipitation and

there has been a plan approved by the Borough Council that provides
for minimizing erosion and sedimentation consistent with this Section,
and an improvement bond or other acceptable securities are deposited
with the Borough which will insure installation and completion of the
required improvements; or (2) there has been a determination by the
Borough Council that a plan for minimizing erosion arid sedimentation
is not necessary.
3. Where a subdivision or land development is subject to the soil erosion
and sediment control regulations of the Montgomery County Soil
Conservation District or the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, the regulation of these agencies shall supersede the
requirement contained herein.
4. Performance Principles. The following measures shall be followed when
preparing a soil erosion and sediment control plan to minimize erosion
and sediment and shall be included where applicable in the plan.
§ 22-414 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-417
1:479
A. Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion.
B. Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
C. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
D. The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
E. Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
F. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
G. The permanent (final) vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
H. Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary the rate of surface water
runoff should be structurally controlled.
I. Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of silt fencing, debris basins, sediment
basins, silt traps, or similar measures.
J. Silt fencing, stone construction entrances, inlet protection and
other approved measures shall be installed to prevent the flow of
sediment off-site or onto adjoining lot or into the Borough drainage
facilities.
K. Soil erosion and sediment control plan, not requiring the review
and approval of the County Soil Conservation District or the PADEP,
shall be reviewed and approved by the Borough Engineer.
5. Excavations and Fills.
A. Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than 2:1 unless stabilized by
a retaining wall or cribbing, except as approved by the Borough
Council when handled under special conditions.
B. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills.
C. Cut and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
D. No increased surface runoff will be permitted to leave the property
being subdivided or developed by way of natural watercourses or
§ 22-417 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 22-417
1:480
storm drainage pipes, without first being suitably retained in such
a way as to maintain runoff volume existing on the site previous to
subdivision or development.
E. Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
F. Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
G. Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during
periods of flooding.
H. Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water onto
the property of another landowner without the written consent of
that landowner and the approval of Borough Council.
I. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
J. Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provision will be made for the installation of temporary culverts or

streetlights, fire hydrants, street signs, shade trees, monuments and
other facilities and utilities specified in this Chapter.
3. The applicant shall agree in writing to construct streets and other
improvements required by this Chapter from the lot or lots to be sold or
built upon to an existing improved street. The work shall be performed
in strict accordance with approved plans and the Borough standards
and specifications, or the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Publication 408, latest edition, or any
subsequent number or section thereof. No plan shall be finally approved
until the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements as required as a condition for final approval of a plan; or
until such time as the applicant has provided a proper guarantee in the
form of a performance bond or bonds in an amount equal to 125% of the

performance bond, Borough Council may accept other security
guaranteeing performance by the applicant.
4. Any performance bond shall assure the complete installation of the
required improvements within a period not longer than three years, and
the proceeds of such bond shall be made payable directly to the

Chapter to implement the following community development objectives
which have been adopted by the Borough Council of Conshohocken.
A. Growth. Conshohocken Borough is a developed community with an
established character that should be preserved. All future growth,
whether by infilling of remaining vacant land or by redevelopment,
should occur in an orderly and controlled manner that is consistent with
the scale and character of the Borough.
B. Land Use. Conshohocken Borough has a wide variety of land uses,
including a strong residential character. The Borough should preserve
and protect the character, stability, and value of land and buildings.
C. Housing. The Borough has a diverse housing mix, with many types and
densities, and appearances. The integrity of established residential
neighborhoods should be protected. Infill housing should complement
the existing neighborhoods. New development should provide adequate
off-street parking, recreation facilities, and open space.
D. Commerce. Future commercial development should respect
surrounding residential neighborhoods. In the Borough, commercial
activities should mix with residential in certain areas such as Fayette
Street and the redevelopment area.
E. Industry. The existing industry in the Borough should be adequately
regulated so that it may remain and its noise, odors, or other unwanted
features can be minimized.
F. Institutions. The many institutions in the Borough are part of the
community and should be encouraged to remain and yet be respectful
to surrounding residential neighborhoods.
G. Transportation. The Borough should strive for the best possible
relationship between land use and transportation. The public
thoroughfares of the Borough should be safe and efficient for all
vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
H. Community Facilities and Services. The present level of community
services should be expanded and improved. The Borough should have
appropriate open spaces, recreation facilities, opportunities for
education and enrichment, and health and safety services.
I. Intergovernmental Cooperation and Implementation. The Borough
should cooperate with other communities on regional affairs. The
Comprehensive Plan should guide growth through strong program of
planning with active citizen participation.
J. Environment. Borough regulations should maintain a high standard of
air and water quality and the protection of natural resources, including
stream valleys, floodplains, and riverbanks. The appearance of the
Borough should be improved through appropriate sign regulation,
landscaping, and design controls.

detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character of
the neighborhood and that the use of the adjacent property is
adequately safeguarded.
C. Determine that the proposed change will serve the best interests of the
Borough, the convenience of the community (where applicable), and the
public welfare.

of the application. The Borough Council shall retain the exclusive right
to enact and amend ordinances.
1. Variance. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may grant a variance provided that all of
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
F. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this Chapter.
G. Where additional requirements may govern the granting of a
variance, such as in Part 17, Floodplain Conservation District,
these requirements must be satisfied before the Board will render a
decision.
2. Special Exception. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide
requests for special exceptions in accordance with the standards and
criteria found in the particular section of this Chapter that permits
application for said special exception. In granting any special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and

safeguards, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter.
3. Discontinuance of Variance or Special Exception. A variance or special
exception, when discontinued, may be resumed any time within one
year from such discontinuance, but not thereafter unless a variance is
granted by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with Part 6 of this
Chapter.
1. Time Limitations on Appeals.
A. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
B. Appeals designed to secure reversal or limit the approval of any
application for development, preliminary or final, shall be filed with
the Board no later than 30 days after the application is approved by
an appropriate municipal officer or agency, unless the person filing
alleges and proves that they had not notice, knowledge, or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person
succeeded to their interest after such approval, they shall be bound
by the knowledge of their predecessor in interest.
2. Effect of Filing. When an appeal is filed, further development or official
action pursuant to the appealed determination or approval shall be
stayed until issuance of a final decision or findings by the Board. If the
Zoning Officer or other municipal agency presents facts to the Board
indicating that such a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, development or official; action can only be stayed by
restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
3. Substantive Validity Challenge. A landowner who desires to challenge,
on substantive grounds, the validity of a map or ordinance provision
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest, may submit the challenge either to the Zoning Hearing
Board or, with a request for curative amendment, to the Borough
Council.
A. The written application to the Zoning Hearing Board shall contain
the reasons for the challenge.
B. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
this Chapter or map is in question, and shall specify the place and
time where a copy of the request and its accompanying materials
may be examined by the public.

through 12/2005]
Any persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board may within 30 days
thereafter appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County
in accordance with the provisions of Section 1002(A) of the Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended.
C. Based upon the testimony at the hearing(s), the Board shall
determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective,
as alleged. If the challenge is found to have merit, the decision of
the Board shall include recommended amendments to the
challenged ordinance, which will cure the defects found.
D. In reaching its decision, the Board shall consider the plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner, and shall also
consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available
to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of this Chapter or map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features;
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources
and other natural features, including the degree to which these
are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development, and any adverse environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
E. If the Board fails to act on the request within 45 days of the last
hearing, a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred.

1. Purpose and Intent: the purpose of this Chapter is to establish
guidelines for the siting of wireless telecommunications towers and
antennas and ancillary facilities. The goals of this Chapter are to:
A. Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
B. Encourage the location of towers on municipally owned property
where appropriate or in other nonresidential areas;
C. Minimize the total number of towers throughout the Borough;
§ 27-813 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 27-814
1:634
D. Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
towers;
E. Encourage the use of existing buildings, telecommunication
towers, light or utility poles and/or towers as opposed to
construction of new telecommunication towers;
F. Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the Borough
is minimal;
G. Ensure that all telecommunication facilities, including towers,
antennas and ancillary facilities are located and designed to
minimize the visual impact on the immediate surroundings and
throughout the community by encouraging users of towers and
antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse
visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design,
siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
H. Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently;
I. Consider the public health and safety of telecommunication towers;
and
J. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In
furtherance of these purposes, the Borough of Conshohocken shall
give due consideration to the municipalities Master Plan, Zoning
Map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.

tower and its appurtenant structures constitute the sole use of the
lot, the tower shall be deemed to be the principal use otherwise,
the use shall be considered accessory.
B. Leased Area. For purposes of determining whether the installation
of a tower or antenna complies with the zoning district in which it is
located, including but not limited to setback requirements, lotcoverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the
dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas
or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
C. State or Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any
other agency of the state or federal government with the authority
to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations
are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed
by this Chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 90

1:638
days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless
a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling
state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense.
D. Building Codes: Safety Standards. To ensure the structural
integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is
maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable
state or local building codes and the applicable standards for
towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association
and Telecommunications Industry Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the Borough of Conshohocken
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and

closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure
so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
C. Antennas on Existing Towers. An antenna may be attached to a
preexisting tower in a nonresidential zone and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on
existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new
towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner
consistent with the following:

a written statement of the reasons for the unfeasibility shall be
submitted to the Borough. The Borough may retain a technical
expert in the field of RF engineering to verify if collocation at the
site is not feasible or is feasible given the design configuration most
accommodating to collocation. The cost for such a technical expert
§ 27-814 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-814
1:643
will be at the expense of the applicant. The municipality may deny
approval to an applicant that has not demonstrated a good faith
effort to provide for collocation.

1:725
damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
reconstruction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage (or repetitive loss when a repetitive
loss provision is used), regardless of the actual repair work performed.

Borough of Conshohocken classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March 2, 2016, and issued
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most
recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of
the Flood Insurance Study.
2. The Floodplain Conservation District shall also include areas with soils
listed in § 27-1702, Subsection 1C, along with any community-identified
flood hazard areas.
3. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Conshohocken
and declared to be a part of this Part.
1. The Floodplain Conservation District shall consist of the following
specific areas/districts:
A. The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as
floodway on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which have
been identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS. The floodway represents channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing
the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.

prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction,
development, use or activity within any AE Area/District
without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any
point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be the areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one-percent-annual-chance flood elevations have
been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the elevation shall be determined
by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall
be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. The Shallow Flooding Area/District shall be those areas identified
as Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are
subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow
flooding where average depths are between one and three feet. In

The Floodplain Conservation District may be revised or modified by the
Borough Council of the Borough of Conshohocken where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person document the need
for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than
six months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 27-1711. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 2016-01, 2/17/2016]
Should a dispute concerning any identified boundary arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Planning Commission of the Borough of
Conshohocken, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Borough Council of the Borough of Conshohocken. The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 27-1712. Corporate Boundary Changes. [Ord. 2016-01, 2/17/2016]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
E. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas
where the Borough of Conshohocken has identified local flood
hazard or ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a "Local
Flood Hazard Map" using the best available topographic data and
locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high

feet as measured from the intersection (corner) of the
primary and secondary facades. This shall include the
use of transparent exterior storefront facades and
entries to create a facade that provides visual interest
to pedestrians. When the slope of a street is 2.5% or
greater, such that it makes multiple entries or
transparent exterior storefronts impractical, the
minimum transparency may be decreased to 65%,
provided that efforts are made to activate and make an
opaque portion of the facade visually interesting to
pedestrians. At no point should the height of any
opaque portion of a primary facade exceed 12 feet in
height for a distance greater than 18 inches, and every
effort shall be made to reduce the height of the
opaque portion of the wall with the change in slope of
the street.
(b) Secondary Facade.
1) A secondary facade is any facade facing any public
street that is not Fayette Street.
2) Secondary facades shall incorporate animated facade
areas to create an external streetscape presence. This
shall include the use of transparent exterior storefront
glazing, faux or semi-transparent glazing, entries,
landscaping, artwork, seating, canopies and awnings,
or other similar features, where possible, which create
a facade that provides interest to pedestrians and
passersby in vehicles.
(c) Entries and Doorways. Buildings shall have a transparent
primary entry that will be considered as part of the overall
transparency requirement for the building. Buildings
fronting Fayette Street and public gathering areas shall
have a primary entry on Fayette Street or at the corner
facing the public gathering area. Commercial storefronts
fronting the public gathering area shall have a primary
§ 27-2203 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 27-2203
1:816
entry on this facade. Commercial storefronts fronting
streets other than Fayette Street or the public gathering
area shall have a primary entrance located on the same
street.
(14) Maximum Wall Height: The following regulations shall apply in
unified developments: [Amended by Ord. No. 05-2018, 10/
17/2018]
(a) Except as provided for in Subsection 1A(14)(b), the visible
portion of retaining walls shall not exceed 10 feet in
height.
(b) The visible portion of a retaining wall may be increased to
exceed 10 feet in height, up to a maximum of 13 feet in
height, if the visible portion greater than 10 feet abuts a
loading and/or service area internal to the unified
development.
(c) Any visible portion of retaining walls in excess of five feet
shall be designed with articulation or other features to
mitigate wall height issues.
(15) Adaptive Reuse: Adaptive reuse of historic or significant
structures is required. The proposed use must be compatible
with adjacent uses.
B. Development Standards:
(1) Location Requirements:
(a) Must contain a minimum of 300 feet of frontage on one
major arterial road as calculated for the unified
development;
(b) Shall not be permitted on a tract located within 90 feet of
another tract containing a unified development in the SP-4
District; however, this provision shall not restrict an
applicant from adding land into an approved unified
development.
(2) Separate ownership of or conveyance of a parcel or parcels
within the approved plan shall be permitted upon compliance
with the following conditions:
(a) Irrevocable perpetual cross-easements are in effect and
recorded, whether set forth in a cross-easement
agreement or in a plan of condominium, in favor of and
duly binding on all title owners (and their respective
successors and assigns) within the area of the approved
plan, with respect to use, control and maintenance of the
common areas, including but not limited to access areas,
green areas, and parking areas.

§ 27-2204. Dimensional Standards for Uses Other Than a Unified
Development. [Ord. 05-2017, 5/17/2017]
The dimensional standards for any uses permitted in the SP-4 District
other than a unified development shall be subject to the requirements in
§ 27-1303.
§ 27-2205. Signage Standards. [Ord. 05-2017, 5/17/2017]

Standards for a Unified Development. [Ord. 05-2017, 5/17/2017]
(b) The application of zoning requirements, including but not
limited to building coverage, impervious coverage, open
space, parking, loading, buffers, setbacks and landscaping
shall apply to the overall site approved as a unified
development area. Individual lots within the plan or
created pursuant to this section need not comply with
these zoning requirements.
(3) Staging.
(a) All proposed unified developments shall be constructed in
accordance with an overall plan and shall include the
planned phasing and schedule of construction.
(b) Staging shall include the time for beginning and
completion of each stage. Such timing may be modified by
Council on the showing of good cause by the developer.
(c) All parcels shall be included in the unified development
plan, with a minimum of conceptual design for later phase
developments.
1. Buildings in the SP-4 District shall have signage which meets the
requirements set forth in § 27-2109, Signs Permitted in the Specially
Planned Districts, except as set forth below for a unified development:
A. One wall sign for the principal use of a building is permitted to be a
maximum of 150 square feet on a building greater than 100 feet in
height. A second wall sign of up to 150 square feet in size is
permitted for buildings greater than 100 feet in height and located
on corner lots, so long as it is located on a second wall (i.e., one
sign per wall). The term "building" as used in this Subsection 1A
shall exclude parking garages.
B. Each accessory first floor use is allowed one sign which meets the
requirements set forth in § 27-2108, Signs Permitted in the
Commercial and Industrial Districts.

1. The parking requirements in the SP-4 District shall be as set forth in
§ 27-2011, Regulations for the Specially Planned District; however, the
required amount of parking for a unified development shall be
permitted to be reduced and phased, if approved by Borough Council as
a conditional use pursuant to § 27-826 of this chapter, based on the
following criteria:
A. Common Parking Areas and Mixed Uses. Parking required for two
or more buildings or uses may be provided in combined parking
facilities where such facilities will continue to be available for the
several buildings or uses and provided that the total number of
spaces is not less than the sum of the spaces required for each use
individually, except that said number of spaces may be reduced by
up to 1/2 such sum if it can be demonstrated that the hours or days
of peak parking needed for the uses are so different that a lower
total will provide adequately for all uses served by the facility. The
following requirements shall be met:
(1) Evidence of reduced parking needs shall be documented in and
based on a parking study prepared by an appropriate
professional and satisfactory to the Borough.
(2) If a lower parking total is approved by Borough Council, then
no change in any use shall thereafter be permitted without
further evidence that the parking will remain adequate in the
future, and if said evidence is not satisfactory, then additional
parking shall be provided before a change in use is authorized.
(3) Evidence of continued availability of common or shared
parking areas shall be provided satisfactory to the Zoning
Officer upon request and shall be documented and filed with
the approved site plan. Notice of a change in the amount of
parking provided within a unified development shall be
provided to the Zoning Officer, and a revised transportation
demand management plan (TDM) shall be submitted.
(4) Notwithstanding any other parking requirements set forth in
§ 27-2011 and this § 27-2206 for individual land uses, when any
land or building is used for two or more distinguishable
purposes (i.e., joint or mixed-use developments), the minimum
total number of parking spaces required to serve the
combination of all uses shall be determined in the following
manner:
Multiply the minimum parking requirement for each individual
use (as set forth in the applicable section of this chapter for
each use) by the appropriate percentage (as set forth below in
the Shared Parking Credit Schedule chart) for each of the five
designated time periods and then add the resulting sums from
each vertical column. The column total having the highest total
§ 27-2206 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-2206
1:819
value is the minimum shared parking space requirement for
that combination of land uses.

(5) A transportation demand management (TDM) plan shall be
submitted for the proposed project and approved by the
Borough as part of the conditional use hearing for the
requested reduced parking. The TDM shall be updated every
three years. "TDM" refers to a variety of strategies aimed at
reducing the demand on the transportation system,
particularly to reducing single-occupant vehicles during peak
periods, and expanding the choices available to residents,
employees, shoppers and visitors. The result is more efficient
use of the existing transportation system. TDM is a critical
§ 27-2206 CONSHOHOCKEN CODE § 27-2206
1:820
component of a reduced parking plan. Traffic needs to be
minimized to decrease congestion within the Borough, to
create livable and walkable spaces, and to minimize the effects
of traffic on neighboring communities. Examples of TDM
measures shall include:
(a) Pre-tax deduction of transit and vanpool fares;
(b) Telework program;
(c) Shower and locker facilities for bicyclists and walkers;
(d) Covered bicycle parking;
(e) Carpool and vanpool preferential parking;
(f) On-site car-sharing vehicle;
(g) Commuter information center (bulletin board, website,
brochure table);
(h) Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC);
(i) Flexible or alternative work hours;
(j) TDM education programs directed at the public and
employees.
B. As a part of the conditional use approval, a parking reduction of
15% may be permitted for a unified development within 1/4 mile
from a passenger rail station, provided the project includes
elements promoting pedestrian connectivity between the unified
development and the subject rail station. As part of a conditional
use hearing, an applicant shall submit evidence as to incentives
being provided to promote the use of the passenger rail station by
the occupants in the project.
C. As part of the conditional use hearing for reduced parking,
Borough Council can, in its sole discretion, require an applicant to
make a portion of its parking facilities available to the public based
on the location of the property in the Borough, the size of the
project and the proposed uses.
2. As to a unified development, the following regulations shall apply and
supersede any other provisions to the contrary in the Zoning
Ordinance:
A. For the purposes of calculating parking required for a hotel use,
1.25 spaces per hotel room (to account for employees) shall be
required.
B. No more than 5% of required parking for a unified development
shall be permitted as surface parking areas. All surface parking

adverse transportation impacts on any adjacent public right-of-way per
areas must meet the landscape and lighting requirements as set
forth in § 22-421, Landscaping and Lighting, of the SALDO.
C. Treatment to above-grade parking structures or parking below
commercial structures facing all public rights-of-way and open
space or green space shall be treated so as to avoid headlight glare
to spill onto the sidewalk or street, and to be architecturally
compatible with the remainder of the buildings and overall site of
the unified development through building materials and
landscaping.
D. The square footage of the unified development can be consolidated
for purposes of complying with the off-street loading requirements
contained in § 27-2011. Any existing building(s) included within the
unified development and without a loading dock shall be deemed
nonconforming as to this requirement.
1. A landscape plan shall be submitted per the requirements of the
SALDO. Use of native plant materials and naturalistic design is
encouraged. The landscape plan shall reflect the requirements of the
SALDO as well as the following detailed criteria:
A. Additional landscaping shall be provided along the exterior walls of
all parking garages, along walkways, in courtyards, around sitting
areas, at the entrance to the site and in other highly visible
locations.
B. The above design criteria, in addition to that required by the
SALDO, is intended to develop a standard whereby adequate
landscaping is included in the development. The criteria are not
intended to strictly direct the location of this landscaping.
C. For a unified development in the SP-4 District, the following
regulations shall apply and supersede any other provisions to the
contrary in the SALDO:
(1) A landscaped verge shall not be required along the perimeter
streets and sidewalks. Street trees shall be located every 30
feet within tree pits covered with walkable tree grates in the
sidewalks.
(2) A landscaped verge, a minimum of four feet in width between
the back of curb and sidewalk, shall be required along internal
public streets (not private drives).

05-2017, 5/17/2017]
All proposed developments within the SP-4 District shall meet the
requirements as set forth in § 27-1507.
§ 27-2211. Design Review Committee. [Ord. 05-2017, 5/17/2017]
All proposed developments within the SP-4 District shall be subject to the
review of the Borough Design Review Committee.
