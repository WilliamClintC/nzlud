materials by the City are made by each department without any central
coordination or method of ensuring that needless purchases are not made;
and the taxpayers' dollars in the City Budget cannot be fully protected

purchasing supplies and materials; therefore, it is declared to be the policy
of the City of Sunbury to create a Purchasing Department and to require
that all City purchases be effected through said Department.

and Finance. The Director of Accounts and Finance shall receive no
compensation in addition to his salary as Councilman for his service as
Director of Purchasing.

and distribution of all supplies and materials purchased by the City of
Sunbury.

copy of the inventory of personal property and supplies of the City
within his department, which inventory he is required to maintain
perpetually by the Third Class City Code, 53 P.S. § 36104. Each
department head shall notify the Director of Purchasing of changes in
the inventory as they occur.
C. All purchases of supplies and materials by the City of Sunbury shall be
made by the Director of Purchasing or such persons as he may
authorize to make said purchases. Department heads requiring supplies
or material shall submit their request to the Director of Purchasing,
who shall fill such requests whenever possible with supplies and
materials already owned by the City.
D. In carrying out his responsibilities, the Director of Purchasing shall
operate the Department of Purchasing in accordance with such rules
and regulations as may be adopted by Council from time to time. The

which quotation shall be secured on the supplies purchased.

it is the intention of the City of Sunbury council members to establish
and impose restrictions upon the construction and operation of outdoor
woodburning furnaces within the limits of the City for the purpose of

imprisonment. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a separate
and distinct offense.

furnace by the end of said seven-consecutive-month period, the
City of Sunbury Code Enforcement Officer shall give written notice
by certified mail or personal service to the owner of the property
upon which the outdoor woodburning furnace is located. Such

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization
§ 92-1. Authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,31 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the City of Sunbury does hereby order
as follows.

General Provisions
§ 92-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 92-3. Permit from Administrator required.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development
anywhere within the City of Sunbury unless a permit has been obtained
from the Floodplain Administrator.
§ 92-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 92-5. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 92-6. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
§ 92-2 FLOOD CONTROL PROPERTY § 92-6

uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sunbury
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

180 days after the date of issuance of the development permit. Work
shall also be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of
the permit or the permit shall expire unless a time extension is granted,
in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The issuance of a
development permit does not refer to the zoning approval.
B. The "actual start of construction" means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways: nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first,
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
C. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted
by the applicant, who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the
Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request, and the original
permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the
time the extension is granted.
A. Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this
chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain
Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance:
§ 92-13 SUNBURY CODE § 92-15
91:110
§ 92-16. Appeals.
(3) Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the
performance of any act it requires;
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be
deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or agent
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state;
(5) Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this chapter or who fails or refuses to
comply with any notice, order or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality
shall be guilty of a summary offense and upon conviction shall pay a fine
to City of Sunbury of not less than $100 nor more than $300 plus costs
of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or noncompliance with, this chapter shall not excuse the
violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or
any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered,
or relocated, in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by
the Council to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
A. Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the Floodplain
Administrator concerning the administration of the provisions of this
chapter may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal must be
filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision, determination or
action of the Floodplain Administrator.
B. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the appeal in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code35 and
any other local ordinance.

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 92-17. Identification.
§ 92-18. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of City of Sunbury, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
September 16, 2016, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by City of Sunbury and declared
to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
§ 92-17 FLOOD CONTROL PROPERTY § 92-18
91:113
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway
has been determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted within any AE Zone without
floodway, and no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed
development, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, would not result in an increase in flood levels of
more than one foot within the entire community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality. In the
absence of any of the above data or documentation, the community
may require elevation of the lowest floor to be at least three feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
§ 92-18 SUNBURY CODE § 92-18
91:114
§ 92-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 92-22B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 92-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the City of Sunbury, and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Council. The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 92-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH,
drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and
away from structures on slopes.
E. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where the
City of Sunbury has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using the best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.

ARTICLE V
Technical Provisions
§ 92-22. General.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When City of Sunbury proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, the City of
Sunbury or applicant shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA
will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications
in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance
with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other applicable
codes, ordinances and regulations.

of water quality standards, reduce local flooding and preserve and maintain
after development, as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff
characteristics of the City.
§ 143-4. Scope.
A. This chapter shall apply to all land and watercourses within the City in
conjunction with the following activities: land development; land
disturbance and alteration; construction of impervious surfaces, new
structures and additions to existing structures; changes or alterations
of any watercourse or drainageway; diversion or piping of any natural
or man-made stream channel, and installation of stormwater systems or
appurtenances thereto.
B. This chapter shall provide for and maintain the existing flows and
quality of streams and watercourses in the City; preserve and restore
the flood-carrying capacity of streams; establish criteria for the design,
installation and proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management structures which are constructed in the City; and, to the
extent practical, assure that the peak rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities.

All activities regulated herein shall be designed and maintained in
accordance with the following requirements:
§ 143-16. Specific requirements.
A. Sites. All sites shall limit the rate of stormwater runoff so that no
greater rate of runoff from the site is permitted than that occurring
prior to development. Predevelopment stormwater runoff shall be
computed for storm frequencies of 10 years.
B. Conveyance system. All stormwater conveyance elements shall be
designed to adequately handle the stormwater flows from the peak rate
of discharge from a ten-year postdevelopment storm event.
C. Detention facilities. Storage calculations for surface detention facilities
shall be designed based on the difference between the one-hundredyear
predevelopment and the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
storms. The primary outlet from the basin shall be no greater than to
allow for a ten-year predevelopment release rate. An emergency
spillway shall be provided for the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
storm.
D. Existing drainageways. Natural drainageways shall be utilized to the
maximum extent possible in carrying stormwater runoff, provided that
such uses remain consistent with the purpose of this chapter and are
not in violation of any existing local, county, state or federal regulations.
Where the tract is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or
stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming
substantially to the line of such watercourse, drainageway, channel or
stream, and of such width as will be adequate to preserve the
unimpeded flow of natural drainage or for the purpose of widening,
deepening, improving or protecting such drainage facilities. An existing
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream location shall be changed
only when approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources, Fish Commission, the United States Army Corps of
Engineers and the Northumberland County Soil Conservation Service,
whichever and to the extent their respective regulatory jurisdiction
applies.
A. General. The minimum stormwater control requirements shall require
that all facilities provide management measures pursuant to § 143-15
above. The pre- and postdevelopment peak discharge rate shall be
computed based on existing and proposed land uses, provided that all
land uses in the site after development are in good hydrologic
condition. Where existing land uses are agricultural, all
predevelopment rates shall be computed based on the land being in

For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the City of Sunbury
during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for
any length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for that year in
the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the
provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes as the same may be allocated by the City of Sunbury from time to
time: emergency services, which shall include emergency medical services,
police services and/or fire services; road construction and/or maintenance;
reduction of property taxes; or property tax relief through implementation

Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to homestead property exclusion). The political
subdivision shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived from the tax
for emergency services. This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any kind
or nature heretofore levied by the political subdivision. The tax shall be no
more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the
number of political subdivisions within which a person maybe employed.
§ 151-25. Exemptions; refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
§ 151-24 SUNBURY CODE § 151-25
148:324
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The City of Sunbury, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The City of Sunbury or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
§ 151-25 SUNBURY CODE § 151-26
148:326
§ 151-27. Duty of employer to prepare and file returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 151-28. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 151-29. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.

weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 151-25B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 151-26 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 151-30
148:327
§ 151-31. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person and, in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 151-32. Administration of tax.
A. The status of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed.
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with

§ 151-33. Suits for collection.
§ 151-34. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 151-34.1. Interpretation of provisions.

which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of

§ 163-29. Designation of parking spaces. [Amended 1-8-1979 by
Ord. No. 990]
The Police Department is hereby authorized to provide for the marking off
of individual parking spaces in the parking zones and areas designated and
described in § 163-37, said parking spaces to be designated by lines painted
or marked on the curbing or surface of the highway or area. At each space
so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a way that said
vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated. At
each space so marked off in the off-highway parking zones established in
§ 163-37B, it shall be unlawful to back into said parking space.
§ 163-30. Installation of meters; operation.
§ 163-31. Manner of parking.
A. In said parking meter zones, parking meters shall be installed upon the
curb, sidewalk or pavement immediately adjacent to the parking spaces
provided in § 163-37 of this article. The Police Department shall be
responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use
of such parking meters.
B. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking
upon the deposit of the appropriate coin for the period of time
hereinafter prescribed. Each device shall be so arranged that upon the
expiration of the lawful time limit it will indicate by a proper, visible
signal that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such case the
right of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator,
owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties
hereinafter provided.
A. When a parking space in any parking meter zone is parallel to the
adjacent curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space
shall be parked so that the foremost part of such vehicle shall be
nearest to the parking meter; provided, however, that where double
parking meters are installed upon one standard so as to serve two
parking spaces, any vehicle parked in the space just beyond the parking
meters shall be parked so that the rear bumper of such vehicle shall be
nearest to the parking meters. When a parking space in any parking
meter zone is diagonal to the curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in
such parking space shall be parked with the foremost part of such
vehicle nearest to such meter.
B. Where lines or markings are painted or placed upon the curb, sidewalk,
highway and/or paved surface adjacent to each parking meter providing
for parking at an angle and not parallel or perpendicular to the curb, it
shall be unlawful for the operator of any motor vehicle to cross the
center line of the highway to enter or leave said parking area.
§ 163-29 TREES § 163-32
159:361
§ 163-32. Deposit of coins.
When any vehicle shall be parked in any space adjacent to which a parking
meter is located in accordance with the provisions of this article, the
operator shall, upon entering the said parking space, immediately deposit
or cause to be deposited such coin or coins of the United States as is
required for such parking meter and as is designated by proper instructions
on the parking meter, and failure to deposit such coin or coins shall
constitute a breach of this article and shall subject such person to the
penalty prescribed hereafter. Upon the deposit of such coin or coins and
placing said meter in operation, the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of parking time which has been
prescribed for the zone in which said parking space is located and for which
a coin or coins is or are deposited as indicated on the parking meter. If
said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the
parking time limit so fixed for such parking space, the parking meter shall,
by its violation signal, dial or pointer, indicate such illegal parking, and in
that event such vehicle shall be considered as parked overtime and beyond
the period of legal parking time. The parking of a vehicle overtime or
beyond the period of legal parking time in any such space where any such
parking meter is located shall be a violation of this article and punishable
as hereinafter set forth.
§ 163-33. Violations.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of the provisions of this article for any
person:
A. To cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in the name of or
operated by such person to be parked overtime or beyond the period of
legal parking time established for any parking meter zone as herein
described, or to deposit in any parking meter any coin for the purpose
of parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for the particular
parking meter zone.
B. To permit any vehicle to remain or be placed in any parking space
adjacent to any parking meter while said meter is displaying a signal
indicating that the vehicle occupying such parking space has already
been parked beyond the period prescribed for such parking space.
C. To park any vehicle across any line or marking of a parking meter space
or in such position that the vehicle shall not be entirely within the area
designated by such lines or markings.
D. To deface, injure, tamper with, open or willfully break, destroy or impair
the usefulness of any parking meter installed under the provisions of
this article.
E. To deposit or cause to be deposited in any parking meter any slug,

promote the proper development of the community; provided that
such nonconforming structure or use shall be completely removed
upon expiration of the permit without cost to the City of Sunbury.
Such permits shall be issued for a specified period of time not to
exceed one year and may be renewed annually, at the discretion of
the City Council.
(2) A temporary permit shall not be issued for any permanent structure

proposed to be erected thereon.
B. Time limit for appeals, etc., to Zoning Hearing Board. No person shall
be allowed to file an appeal or other proceeding before the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for a permit or for
other action under this Zoning Chapter has been approved or
disapproved by the Zoning Officer or other appropriate municipal
officer or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal of or
limit the approval or disapproval in any manner, unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to
believe that such approval or disapproval had been given. If such
person has succeeded to his interest after such approval or disapproval,
he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
C. Hearings. The Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct hearings and make
decisions in accordance with the requirements of this Zoning Chapter

D. Special exceptions.
§ 175-111 WATER § 175-111
172:455
(1) In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to
those expressed in this Zoning Chapter, as it may deem necessary
to implement the purposes of this Zoning Chapter. In its
consideration of the request for a special exception, the Board shall
take into account the following:
(a) The effect or impact of the proposed use upon the character of
the immediate neighborhood. In this regard, the Board shall
consider, among other things, the impact of the proposed use
on the value of surrounding properties and whether the
proposed use is consistent with surrounding uses.
(b) Whether the increase in traffic resulting from the proposed use
will cause an unwarranted impact upon the immediate
neighborhood and/or whether there is a high degree of
probability that the safety and health of the immediate
neighborhood or of the community at large will be adversely
affected thereby. (The Board shall take notice that the City
Council, in providing for special exceptions in this Zoning
Chapter, has recognized that the use of land for such purposes
will result in an increase in traffic commensurate with such
use.)
(2) A special exception use for which a permit is granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to the provisions of this Zoning Chapter
shall be construed to be conforming use.
E. Variances.
(1) In granting a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this Zoning Chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this Zoning Chapter. The Board may
grant a variance, provided that the following findings are made
where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions, peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Zoning Chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Chapter
and the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
§ 175-111 SUNBURY CODE § 175-111
172:456
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance which will afford relief and represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) The following factors shall be considered when reviewing cases for
variances in the Floodplain District:
(a) Variances shall not be issued by the Board within the
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
(b) Variances may be issued by the Board for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, in
conformance with the procedures of Subsection E(2)(c), (d), (e)
and (f) below.
(c) Variances shall only be issued by the Board upon a showing of
good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant
the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant and a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
(e) The Board shall notify the applicant, in writing, over the
signature of a community official, that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and that
such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions as required in Subsection E(2)(f)
below.
(f) The Board shall maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and shall report such
§ 175-111 WATER § 175-111

variances issued in its annual report submitted to the Federal
Insurance Administrator.
F. Certificate of nonconformance. When a question arises in regard to the
provisions of Article XII or when the applicant for a certificate of
nonconformance wishes to appeal the decision of the Zoning Officer in
regard to issuing a certificate of nonconformance, an application for a
certificate of nonconformance may be made to the Zoning Hearing
Board by the owner of any property which does not conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Chapter. Such application may be made at any
time and a certificate issued upon receipt of proper information. The
certificate shall set forth in detail all of the nonconforming conditions of
said property. Said certificate shall be for the purpose of ensuring to
such owner the right to continue a nonconforming use. A copy of the
certificate shall be retained by the Zoning Hearing Board.
A. Zoning permits.
(1) The fee for a zoning permit shall be $5. Such fee shall be payable at
the office of the Zoning Officer upon making application for such
permit, and no permit shall be issued until such fee is paid.

is begun without first securing a permit therefor, a permit shall be
obtained at a fee which shall be double that required by
§ 175-112A(1).

§ A180-3. Franchise required.

a duly enacted ordinance of the municipality.
§ A180-4. Grant of authority.
Having determined that the continued availability of cable television service
affords significant social, educational and entertainment benefits to the

serving this municipality; the municipality hereby grants unto the company
the nonexclusive right and privilege to construct, erect, operate and
maintain a cable television system in, under, over, along, across or upon
the public streets, highways, sidewalks, rights-of-way and places within
the boundaries of the municipality, to the extent permitted by law. The

economically justify such installation or extension. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if otherwise practicable and technically feasible:
