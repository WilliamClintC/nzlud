PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Racine, Wisconsin. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code, as supplemented through October 16, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER ORDINANCES INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Dan Wright, Deputy City Attorney, Karen Norton, City Clerk, and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(7)  Elected and appointed officials of the city shall not be required to pay for public records they may reasonably require for the proper performance of their official duties. 
(8)  The legal custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where he determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest. 
(g)  Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 19.34, each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which the legal custodian from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of records, and the costs thereof. This subsection does not apply to members of the common council. 
(Code 1973, § 3.33.040; Ord. No. 14-98, pt. 2, 9-15-98; Ord. No. 0028-19, pt. 3, 11-12-19)  
Sec. 2-655. - Access procedures. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. A request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stats. § 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under section 2-654(f)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Upon request for any record, each custodian shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may be required to itemize the request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance before the custodian grants or denies the request. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 2-656. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(Code 1973, § 3.33.050)  
Sec. 2-656. - Limitations on right to access. 
(a)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 19.36, the following records are exempt from inspection under this article: 
(1)  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law. 
(2)  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aid by the state. 
(3)  Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection. 
(4)  A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. 
(b)  Public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this article, in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 43.30. 
(c)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if the custodian determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
(2)  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing. 
(3)  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline of any city officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a city officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure. 
(4)  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. 
(5)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of city property, investing of city funds, or other city business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure. 
(6)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data. 
(7)  Communications between legal counsel for the city and any officer, agent or employee of the city, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the city or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(d)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the city attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the city attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the city attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. 
(Code 1973, § 3.33.060)  
Sec. 2-657. - Destruction of records. 
(a)  City officers may destroy the nonutility financial records of which they are the legal custodians and which are considered obsolete, after completion of any required audit by the bureau of municipal audit or an auditor licensed under Wis. Stats. ch. 442, but not less than seven years after payment or receipt of any sum involved in the particular transaction, unless a shorter period has been fixed by the state public records board pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 16.61(3)(e), and then after such shorter period. 
(b)  City officers may destroy utility records of which they are the legal custodians and which are considered obsolete after completion of any required audit by the bureau of municipal audit or an auditor licensed under Wis. Stats. ch. 442, subject to state public service commission regulations, but not less than seven years after the record was effective unless a shorter period has been fixed by the state public records board pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 16.61(3)(e), and then after such a shorter period, except that water stubs, receipts of current buildings and customer's ledgers may be destroyed after two years except that the following records shall be kept permanently: annual reports, construction records, sewer service contracts, water service contracts. 
(c)  City officers may destroy records of which they are the legal custodian and which are considered obsolete, but not less than seven years after the record was effective unless another period has been set by statute, and then after such a period, or unless a shorter period has been fixed by the state public records board pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 16.61(3) and then after such a shorter period. 
(d)  Prior to destruction of any public record described herein at least 60 days prior written notice shall be given to the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. This chapter shall not be construed to authorize the destruction of any public record after a period less than prescribed by statute or state administrative regulations.

Chapter 3 - SEXUAL OFFENDERS RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS 
 
Sec. 3-1. - Sexual offender residency restrictions. 
(a)  Finding and intent. 
(1)  The common council finds that repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to public safety. It is further believed that these sex offenders are more likely to re-offend when presented with opportunity and access to vulnerable victims. As such, the council hereby establishes regulations which restrict certain offenders from residing or congregating in areas that are at or near where there is a high concentration of children in order to provide better protection for children in the city by minimizing immediate access and proximity to children and thereby reducing opportunity and temptation for recidivism. This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the city from the risk that convicted sex offenders may re-offend in locations close to their residences or commit opportunistic crimes. 
(2)  This chapter aims to protect the health and safety of children in the city from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences or commit opportunistic crimes. It is the intent of this chapter not to impose a criminal penalty or punish the offender, but instead to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around the locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sex offenders and sex predators are prohibited from loitering or residing. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except when the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(a)  Notwithstanding the time limits set forth herein, whenever the proposed licensed premises is a building to be newly constructed or an existing building upon which major alteration, addition, renovation or other similar work is required in order to bring the premises in conformity with the representations made to the common council as part of the application and consideration of the application, the common council may grant a license conditioned upon the satisfactory completion of such construction, alteration, addition, renovation or other work, or such annexation. 
(b)  In cases where the proposed licensed premises is not yet open for regular business at the time of the application, the common council may grant a license conditioned upon the entity completing all work and obtaining the necessary permits to start operating under such license. 
(c)  The common council, in making such a conditional grant of a license under subsections (a) or (b), shall direct the city clerk to withhold the issuance of the license for such time, not to exceed six months, as the common council deems a reasonable period for completion of any renovation, addition, or work and procurement of any necessary permits in order to start operating under the license in conformity with all such representations made to the common council. The common council's approval of a conditional grant of a license under this section does not constitute the issuance of a license unless and until the city clerk issues the license to the applicant after all work has been completed and all conditions for the license have been met. 
During such period of time as the referenced work is being completed, the applicant must provide written progress reports to the city clerk every 60 days. 
Upon written request of the applicant to the public safety and licensing committee, this period may be extended two times for an additional period not to exceed three months each, but no such extension shall be granted unless the applicant can demonstrate that he or she has already completed a substantial portion of the work, construction or renovation of the premises with the original time set by the common council for withholding of the issuance of the license pending completion of the work. The applicant shall notify the city clerk upon completion of the work when the applicant is ready to start operating under the license, after which the city clerk shall cause such inspection of the premises as is deemed appropriate to ascertain that the premises is in conformity with all material representations made to the common council at the time of the granting of the license. Upon satisfactory completion of the work and/or other conditions within the permitted time frame, the public safety and licensing committee may direct the city clerk to issue the license. 
(d)  Failure to conform with all such representations made to the common council and/or the public safety and licensing committee as to the proposed licensed premises within the time set for completion of such work and/or other conditions and any extensions of such time shall render the decision to grant the license void, and shall be deemed a denial of the application by the common council and/or the public safety and licensing committee as of the expiration of the time or extended time for completion of construction. If the license is not issued to the applicant within the allotted time frame, such application shall be considered denied and the applicant may reapply for a license, if there is one available. 
(e)  In any case where there is a conditional grant of license, and the license is ordered withheld for a time period or periods to allow for construction and/or completion of other work, and the applicant subsequently fails to satisfy the conditions of the grant of the license by satisfactory completion of such conditions within the allotted time, or failure to meet other requirements herein, the entirety of the license fee shall be nonrefundable, and the license in question shall not be issued even if the applicant ultimately completes the construction.

Sec. 6-97. - Class "A" and "Class A" licenses quota and geographic restrictions. 
(a)  Number of licenses. At the time of the enactment of this section, there were 40 Class "A" license holders and 26 "Class A" holders. As part of a comprehensive effort to decrease the incidence of alcohol-related problems, to protect the safety and welfare of the community from increasing rates of alcohol-related crime and violence and to reduce the strain on public resources, the common council seeks to reduce the number of "Class A" and Class "A" alcohol beverage licenses in the city in accordance with the following prospective quotas: 
The total number of Class "A" licenses shall not exceed 36, and 
The total number of "Class A" licenses shall not exceed 24. 
(b)  Geographic restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no new retail "Class A" or Class "A" intoxicating liquor license shall be issued for any establishment located within a radius of 1,000 feet from any other licensed establishment (regardless of the type of Class A alcohol license held) or within a radius of 300 feet of any active place of worship, licensed day care center, school, community center or other facility predominantly attended by individuals under the age of 21. Said distances are measured from lot line to lot line. 
(c)  Public hearing. The common council shall hold a public hearing upon every Class "A" and "Class A" license application and/or petition in order to exceed the quota and shall notify all property owners within a radius of five-tenths of a mile of the proposed site of the date of the hearing. The notice shall be given at least five days before the hearing and may be given by mail or other publication. 
(d)  Exceeding quota or geographic concentration restrictions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the common council may, by a two-thirds vote of all the members present of the common council, grant a new retail Class "A" fermented malt beverage or a new retail "Class A" intoxicating liquor license in excess of the quota set forth in subsection (c) or the geographic concentration restrictions set forth in subsection (d). This license is not intended to permanently increase the quota, but rather to temporarily exceed the quota for reasons of benefiting the community as set forth in subsections (1)—(4). 
It having been found by the common council in imposing the quotas or in exceeding the geographic concentration restrictions in this section that the proliferation of taverns and liquor stores can be a detriment to the city and the community by reducing property values, deteriorating the quiet enjoyment of neighborhoods and costing considerable tax dollars to police said business, it is determined that quota may be exceeded if the establishment meets the provisions set forth in this chapter and the following criteria be met: 
(1)  The applicant shall submit to the city clerk a petition for exceeding quota. The petition shall include a business plan of operation and the relevant experience, background and signatures of the individual, partners or directors, officers and agent of a corporation or limited liability company, as well as the signature of the owner or owners of the building or land and any and all other information required in section 6-54; 
(2)  The applicant shall supply proof of ownership or lease of options to purchase or lease of land or a building that is properly zoned for the proposed venture; 
(3)  The applicant shall show that the proposed establishment will have a greater economic impact upon the community than simply the addition of another tavern, liquor store, convenience store or restaurant; and 
(4)  The applicant shall show that the proposed establishment will benefit the community by substantially improving the tax base (i.e. the establishment will extensively rehabilitate a blighted or deteriorated building, construct a new building on vacant land, or benefit the community by conferring some other tangible and substantial improvement for the area). 
(e)  Exemptions. When an establishment with a valid "Class A" or Class "A" license as of June 30, 2009, is thereafter sold, the subsequent buyer shall not be subject to either the quota or geographic restrictions set forth in this article when applying for a new license. New licenses may be granted in such instances, contingent upon surrender of the existing license by the seller and upon the buyer's meeting all other requirements established by the city. An establishment whose license has been denied renewal or revoked or has otherwise expired, does not qualify for this exemption. Any conditions previously placed on the seller's licensed premises transfer to the buyer's licensed premises in addition to any new conditions that may be imposed. This exemption only applies if there is no change to the location of the premises.

All structures erected to house dangerous animals shall comply with all city health, building, and zoning regulations and be adequately lighted and ventilated and kept in a clean and sanitary condition. 
(8)  Animal restraint off property. No owner or caretaker may permit a dangerous animal to go outside its dwelling, kennel, pen or premises where it is being harbored unless the animal is muzzled and restrained by a bright fluorescent yellow collar with harness and sturdy, nonretractable lead of unfrayed material not exceeding four feet in length. The animal must be under the control of an adult, able-bodied person competent to govern the animal and physically capable of controlling and restraining the animal. The animal may not be leashed to inanimate objects such as trees, posts and buildings. The animal shall be muzzled in a humane way by a muzzling device sufficient to prevent the animal from biting persons or other animals. Dangerous animals are not permitted in dog exercise parks and shall not be transported in a vehicle that might allow the animal to escape or gain access to any person or animal outside the vehicle.

(4)  Any animal declared to be a prohibited dangerous animal that is not removed from the city within five business days of it being declared a prohibited dangerous animal may be seized by the city pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 173.13(1). 
(5)  The owner or caretaker shall provide the City of Racine Police Department, within five business days of the animal being declared a prohibited dangerous animal, the name, address, and telephone number of the person that will be in possession of the prohibited dangerous animal or a certification from a licensed veterinarian that the prohibited dangerous animal was humanely euthanized. The owner or caretaker shall also present evidence to the Racine Police Department showing that he or she has notified the law enforcement or animal control agency of the animal's new residence, including the name, address and telephone number of the new owner and advised that the animal is a prohibited dangerous animal. 
(e)  Appeal process for dangerous and prohibited dangerous animal. 
(1)  Whenever an owner or caretaker wishes to contest an order declaring an animal dangerous under subsection (b) or prohibited dangerous under subsection (d), he or she shall, within five business days after receipt of the order, deliver to the department that issued the order a written objection to the order, addressed to the administrative reviewer, stating specific reasons for contesting the order. A fee as set forth in the fee schedule as established by the common council must accompany the request. The administrative reviewer will be appointed by the Mayor of the City of Racine. Upon receipt of the written objection for administrative review, the appeal will be reviewed within five business days. The administrative reviewer acts as a quasi-judicial body allowing the animal's owner or caretaker an opportunity to present evidence as to why the animal should not be declared dangerous or prohibited dangerous. The city elects not to be bound by Wis. Stats. ch. 68 with respect to administrative procedure in this regard. 
(2)  After the administrative review, the owner or caretaker shall be notified in writing within five business days of the determination.

The owner or caretaker shall also provide the City of Racine Police Department and City of Racine Department of Public Health with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner of the animal within five business days.

The owner or caretaker of any animal confined on the premises of the owner or caretaker must comply with the restrictions set forth in subsection (c). The chief of police, the public health administrator, or the designee of either may order impoundment/seizure of the animal pending his/her investigation and through any appeal hearing under subsection (e), pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 173.13(1). 
(2)  The owner or caretaker of the animal shall be liable to the city for the costs and expenses of impounding an animal unless the chief of police, the public health administrator, or the designee of either fails to declare the animal dangerous or prohibited dangerous or the determination is ultimately overturned by administrative review. 
(3)  The owner or caretaker of an animal confined on the premises under subsection (g)(1) shall immediately notify the City of Racine Police Department and City of Racine Department of Public Health if the animal is loose or unconfined, has attacked, bitten, or injured another animal, has attacked, bitten or injured a human being, has died, or was surrendered.

Mailing written notice to the owner's or caretaker's last known address shall satisfy this requirement. 
(h)  Destruction. Any animal that has caused bodily harm to a person or a domestic animal on two separate occasions off the owner's premises, without reasonable cause may be destroyed as a result of a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction as specified under Wis. Stats. § 174.02(3). The city attorney may petition an appropriate court to obtain a court order to destroy such an animal.

Sec. 14-38. - Findings and declaration of public safety and general welfare. 
(a)  Horlick-Racine Airport is located in the towns of Caledonia and Mt. Pleasant and the City of Racine, in the County of Racine, State of Wisconsin. The airport serves the general aviation needs of these and neighboring communities. The Federal Aviation Administration has designated the airport as an official reliever airport for General Mitchell International Airport and O'Hare International Airport in the category of general aviation. The airport is at all times open for use by the general public. 
(b)  It is hereby declared that obstructions to the airspace required for the safe landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft and that land uses which interfere with the safe operation of aircraft have the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of Horlick-Racine Airport and of those who occupy land in its vicinity. It is therefore determined that the public safety and general welfare require the prohibition of hazardous land use and obstructions to the airspace necessary for safe airport operations. It is further declared that the purpose of this division is to maintain the existing utility of Horlick-Racine Airport and to prevent further encroachment or obstruction of the airspace necessary for safe landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft. This division is intended to replace three different airspace protection ordinances now existing under the jurisdiction of the Town of Mt. Pleasant, County of Racine, and City of Racine with the uniform airspace protection ordinance set out in this division. So far as it is practicable, this uniform airspace protection ordinance has been structured and modeled in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations part 77, pertaining to objects affecting navigable airspace. Consideration has also been given to the recommendations of the Federal Aviation Administration, state department of transportation, division of aeronautics, southeastern regional planning commission and other relevant information sources in establishing this division for the safety and general welfare of the public.

Note: The required extreme fiber stress in bending, "F;sub\sub;", in pounds per square inch is shown below each span.  
Sec. 18-446. - Table R-8; low slope rafters. 
The following table no. R-8 indicates the requirements for low slope rafters. 
TABLE R-8 
LOW SLOPE RAFTERS 
Slope 3 in 12 or less - 30 Lbs. Per Sq. Ft. Live Load 
(No Finished Ceiling) 
DESIGN CRITERIA: 
Strength - 10 lbs. per sq. ft. dead load plus 30 lbs. per sq. ft. live load determines required fiber stress. 
Deflection - For 30 lbs. per sq. ft. live load. Limited to span in inches divided by 240. 
RAFTERS: Spans are measured along the horizontal projection and loads are considered as applied on the horizontal projection.

(b)  Inspection. 
(1)  The health officer may, after being notified that an occupant of a dwelling who is under six years of age has blood lead poisoning or lead exposure, request that the owner or occupant or their representative admit him or his designee to conduct a lead-bearing paint inspection at the dwelling and the premises associated with the dwelling. If the owner or occupant refuses admission, the health officer may seek a warrant to inspect the dwelling and the premises associated with the dwelling. The warrant shall advise the owner or occupant of the scope of the inspection. The lead-bearing paint inspection shall be conducted during business hours, unless the owner or occupant of the dwelling consents to an inspection during nonbusiness hours or unless the health officer determines that the dwelling or premises associated with the dwelling presents an imminent lead-bearing paint hazard. The health officer may remove samples or objects necessary for laboratory analysis to determine the presence of a lead-bearing paint hazard in the dwelling. 
(2)  If the health officer determines that a lead hazard from lead-bearing paint is present in or on any dwelling or premises associated with the dwelling, the health officer may do any of the following: 
a.  Cause to be posted in a conspicuous place upon the dwelling a notice of the presence of a lead-bearing paint hazard; 
b.  Notify the occupant of the dwelling that a lead-bearing paint hazard is present in the dwelling and may constitute a health hazard; 
c.  Notify the owner of the dwelling of the presence of a lead-bearing paint or other lead containing substance that may constitute a health hazard. The health officer may issue an order that requires reduction or elimination of an imminent lead hazard within five days after the order's issuance and reduction or elimination of other lead hazards within 30 days after the order's issuance, excepting that to the extent that an order issued between October 1 and May 1 relates only to exterior hazards that are not imminent lead hazards, the order may require elimination or reduction of the lead hazard no earlier than the June 1 immediately following the order's issuance.

(3)  The health officer shall give priority to eliminating lead-bearing paint hazards from dwellings and premises associated with the dwellings in which children under six years of age with diagnosed lead poisoning or lead exposure reside. 
(c)  Manner of abatement. In the event an order to remove, replace or cover lead-bearing paints has been issued, such actions shall comply with the following criteria: 
(1)  Lead-bearing paints shall be removed from window sashes. 
(2)  Lead-bearing paints shall be removed from or permanently enclosed on the following surfaces: 
a.  Friction and impact window components including, but not limited to stops, parting beads, jambs (commonly known as sash tracks), and troughs (commonly known as window wells).

(7)  Exterior surfaces that are identified as lead-bearing hazards shall have the deteriorated lead-bearing paint removed from surfaces in accordance with this section and shall be repaired to be structurally sound, weatherproof, watertight and smooth surfaces. Exterior surfaces shall then be coated with non-lead-bearing primer and paint, aluminum, vinyl or steel siding or a covering approved by the health officer pursuant to department orders. 
(8)  When lead hazards have been identified on any portion of the exterior sill of an operational, intact and complete combination storm/screen window, the sill and window casing on the outside of the combination storm/screen portion of the window shall be identified and treated as an exterior lead hazard. 
(9)  Treatment of contaminated soil. In the event of contamination of soil with lead particles, the health officer may order that the soil be abated in accordance with subsection (a)(1)a.7. above. Any contaminated soil shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
(10)  No person shall perform abatement or lead hazard reduction activities without being currently certified for such work by the State of Wisconsin. 
(11)  No person shall perform abatement or lead hazard reduction activities unless such activities are performed in a lead-safe manner. 
(d)  Clearance. Following notification by the owner that abatement is complete, the health officer will perform clearance as follows: 
(1)  Perform a visual inspection to determine if deteriorated painted surfaces or visible amounts of dust, debris or residue are still present. If deteriorated painted surfaces or visible amounts of dust, debris or residue are present, the owner shall eliminate these conditions prior to the continuation of the clearance procedures.

Collect one dust sample from one window, if available, and one dust sample from the floor of each room, hallway or stairwell selected. If there are fewer than four rooms, hallways or stairwells within the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility, collect samples from all rooms, hallways or stairwells. 
(6)  Compare the residual lead level from each dust sample and/or soil, as determined by laboratory analysis, with the applicable clearance level for lead in dust on floors and windows and/or in soil. If the residual lead level in a dust and/or soil sample exceeds the applicable clearance level, all the components represented by the failed sample shall be recleaned or removed or recovered, in the case of soil. The applicable surfaces and/or soil shall be retested by the city until clearance levels are met. Clearance levels include all of the following: 
a.  For an uncarpeted floor, 40 µ/ft 2 
b.  For an interior window sill, or window stool, 200 µ/ft 2

Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any agreement, whether oral or written, if an owner of a residential rental dwelling unit fails or neglects to comply with an order from a code enforcement officer to correct a habitability violation, then upon the expiration of the time given in an order to correct those violations, the code enforcement officer who issued the order to correct, upon application of the tenant, may authorize the tenant, as of the date of application, to deposit rental payments into an escrow account designated by the finance director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tenant shall not be authorized to withhold rent if the only violation is a non-habitability violation, or if the tenant has rent for that property that is unpaid past the due date. It shall be an affirmative defense to a rent withholding under this section to show that the damage or condition on which the violation is based is caused by negligence or improper use by the tenant.

(4)  Appeal from tenant authorization by owner.

(a)  The due process board shall have the power to affirm or reverse the authorization of rent escrow deposit or require the return to the owner all or part of the rent paid to the city escrow account or postpone to a future date the commencement of rent escrow deposit. The due process board may determine which, if any, of the habitability violations was caused by the act or omission of the tenant and make a specific finding of such fact. Such finding shall not relieve the owner or agent from the duty to correct violations of the building code, fire code, health code, or a combination thereof in a timely manner. 
(b)  The due process board shall authorize rent escrow deposit under this section in such instances to continue only until violations are certified as corrected by the code enforcement officer. If a rent payment shall become due during the pendency of an appeal, the tenant shall deposit the rental payment into the escrow account designated by the finance director when due. 
(c)  If the due process board does not authorize continued rent escrow deposit, all money deposited in the escrow account due to lessor shall be paid to the lessor without deduction of administrative fees from the account. If the due process board does authorize continued rent escrow deposit, administrative fees as herein authorized shall be deducted by the city prior to the making of any other disbursements. 
(5)  Receipt of rent withheld. Upon acceptance of rent, the finance director shall cause a receipt to be mailed certified mail, return receipt mail requested, or equivalent private delivery service, to the owner or authorized contact person, which will serve as a notice that rent has been paid.

The right of the tenant to deposit rental payments into the escrow account established by this section shall not preclude or adversely affect in any way the right of the property owner l to use any of the rights and remedies provided by the laws of the State of Wisconsin pertaining to the relationship of landlord and tenant, including, but not limited to, commencing eviction proceedings after notice of nonpayment of rent has been sent. The city has no responsibility for the collection of rent which is not paid when due.

ARTICLE XI. - PROPERTIES PENDING FORECLOSURE REGISTRATION PROGRAM 
 
Sec. 18-1101. - [Findings; purpose and scope; definitions.] 
(1)  Findings. The Common Council of the City of Racine finds that a significant relationship exists among properties in the foreclosure process, the prevalence of blight and abandoned buildings, increased calls for police service, higher incidence of fires, both accidental and intentional, and decline and disinvestment in neighborhoods. Property owners involved in foreclosure have less incentive to maintain their properties, and properties in foreclosure have a higher incidence of building code violations than properties not in foreclosure. The foreclosure process may also result in abandonment of properties. Abandoned buildings may become havens for vandalism, arson, and drug crimes, can drain valuable governmental resources, and may create a significant reduction in quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood. Registration, inspection, and aggressive monitoring of properties in the foreclosure process help to stabilize and improve affected neighborhoods, and aid in code enforcement efforts and public safety. A mortgagee that does not register, inspect, secure, and maintain, as required in this section, places an undue and inappropriate burden on the taxpayers of the city and poses an increased risk to public health, safety, and welfare. 
(2)  Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to establish a registration program to monitor all real properties pending foreclosure to identify at-risk properties and to regulate the securing and maintenance of abandoned properties in foreclosure. This section is intended to reduce and prevent neighborhood blight; to ameliorate conditions that threaten public health, safety, and welfare; to promote neighborhood stability and occupancy by preserving the condition and appearance of properties; and to maintain property values and assessments. It is declared to be a matter of public policy and an exercise of the city's police power that mortgagees initiating foreclosure proceedings against a property are required to register such status with the city. This registration process will give the city the means of contacting those responsible for the foreclosure proceedings and mortgages at issue, those responsible for the securing and maintenance of property under foreclosure and abandoned property as required in this section, and those responsible for the property inspections required in this section. The purpose of the registration fee is to partially recover administrative costs associated with this registry. Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving, relieving, or otherwise excusing an owner of property from complying with applicable building codes and ordinances. The owner shall at all times comply with applicable building codes and ordinances, and the owner shall at all times remain responsible and liable therefor. Nothing in this section is intended to affect the right to foreclose as provided by state law. 
(3)  Definitions. 
Abandoned property means any real property that is in mortgage default, bank owned/REO, or is vacant as a result of the relinquishment of occupancy, possession, or control by a mortgagor and those claiming by, through, or under the mortgagor, including tenants, whether or not the mortgagor relinquished equity and title.

Sec. 22-67. - Purpose. 
It is a lawful purpose of the common council to enact regulatory ordinances protecting and promoting the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of this city. The common council deems it necessary to require licensing and regulation of adult-oriented establishments, namely adult bookstores, because many such establishments install booths with doors in which patrons can view adult-oriented movies or videotapes or film or view other forms of adult entertainment and that it has been found in many localities that viewing booths in such establishments are used by patrons for engaging in sexual acts, particularly between males, which results in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in such booths. Pathogenic agents responsible for sexually transmitted diseases have all been isolated at one time or another from body fluids, which have been found to be frequently present in viewing booths in adult-oriented bookstores. It is thereby necessary for the common council to regulate adult-oriented bookstores for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 29-91, pt. 1, § 22.30.010, 12-17-91)

(1)  Access. Each booth, room or cubicle shall be totally accessible to and from aisles and public areas of the adult-oriented establishment and shall not be obstructed by any door, blind, curtain or other control type device. 
(2)  Construction. Every booth, room or cubicle shall: 
a.  Be separated from adjacent booths, rooms or cubicles and any nonpublic areas by a wall. 
b.  Have at least one side totally open to a public, lighted aisle so that there is an unobstructed view at all times of anyone occupying the booth, room or cubicle. 
c.  Have solid walls without any openings, extended from the floor to a height of not less than six feet, and shall be light colored, with a nonabsorbent, smooth textured and easily cleanable surface. 
d.  Have a light colored, nonabsorbent, smooth textured and easily cleanable floor. 
e.  Have at all times when not in use a minimum lighting level of ten footcandles as measured three feet above the floor.

Cross reference— Traffic and vehicles, ch. 94. 
 
Sec. 22-831. - Purpose and findings. 
The common council finds that there arises, from time to time, a reasonable police need to recover and tow motor vehicles. Such needs include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  An unattended-to car illegally parked or otherwise illegally obstructing traffic; 
(2)  An unattended-to car at the scene of an accident when the driver is physically or mentally incapable of deciding upon steps to be taken to deal with his property, as in the case of an intoxicated, mentally incapacitated or seriously injured driver; 
(3)  A car that has been stolen or used in the commission of a crime when its retention as evidence is necessary; 
(4)  An abandoned car or nuisance vehicle; 
(5)  A car so mechanically defective as to be a menace to others using the public highway; 
(6)  A car impoundable pursuant to ordinance or statute which provides therefor, as in the case of forfeiture. 
The public convenience and necessity requires that the city obtain recovery and towing services for such vehicles from companies which have equipment and facilities which are sufficient to ensure the public convenience and safety. Such requirements dictate the necessity of licensing such companies to perform certain services at the request of the city.

Sec. 22-891. - Pawnbrokers and secondhand article and jewelry dealers. 
Wis. Stats. § 134.71 is hereby adopted and, by reference, made a part of this chapter with the same force and effect as though fully set out herein notwithstanding the below subsections. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this ordinance [section] shall constitute a violation of this chapter, punishable according to the penalties set forth in section 22-892, Racine Municipal Code. 
(1)  Purpose. 
a.  The city finds that a paper-based system of tracking and recording pawnbroker and secondhand dealer sales and purchases is technologically outdated, inefficient and environmentally irresponsible. This section implements and establishes the required use of an electronic reporting system to record transactions by pawnbrokers and secondhand article and jewelry dealers. 
b.  To help the police department decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of pawnbrokers and secondhand article and jewelry dealers, and better facilitate the identification of criminal activities in this industry through the timely collection and sharing of transactional information, this section also implements and establishes the required use of the North Eastern Wisconsin Property Reporting System (NEWPRS). 
c.  The city recognizes that pawnbrokers and secondhand article and jewelry dealers engage in legitimate business transactions authorized by state law. However, the city finds that these services provide individuals with an opportunity to potentially transfer stolen property. The city also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions of this nature. The purpose of the city's regulation of pawnbrokers and secondhand article and jewelry dealers is to prevent their services from being used to facilitate the commission of crimes and to assure compliance with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens, pursuant to the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 134.71

(5)  Grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will unreasonably interfere with any gas, electric or telephone fixtures, water hydrant or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed so as to comply with all requirements of city, provided, however, that this section shall not act to restrict grantee's lawful use of appropriate easements and easements (public or private) dedicated or used for compatible uses.

Sec. 42-55. - Purpose. 
A variety of landscapes adds diversity and richness to the quality of life in the city. However, there are reasonable expectations regarding landscapes that, if not met, may decrease the value of nearby properties, degrade the natural environment or threaten public health and safety. Therefore, it is in the public interest and in the purview of this article to provide standards for development and maintenance of the city's landscapes. 
The common council recognizes landowners' and tenants' interest in having managed turf grass landscapes, but also acknowledges the value of preserving, restoring, and managing native plant communities and wildlife habitats within the city. The use of wildflowers and other native plants in managed landscapes is economical, reduces maintenance, effectively conserves water, soil and other elements of the natural community. Additionally, the preservation, restoration and management of native plant communities and wildlife habitats may preclude the introduction of toxic pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and other pollutants into the environment. 
The common council further acknowledges the enjoyment and benefit from the variety, beauty and practical values of natural landscapes, and seeks to permit landowners and tenants the freedom to employ varying degrees of natural landscaping as viable and desirable alternatives to conventional landscaping modes. 
The common council recognizes that landowners and tenants may properly create and sustain a condition of ecological stability of their landscapes, namely a state of good health and vigor as opposed to one of impairment and decline. It is not the common council's intent to allow vegetated areas to be unmanaged or overgrown in ways that may adversely affect public health or safety, or pose a threat to agricultural activity. It is the express intent of the common council that it shall be lawful to grow native plants including, but not limited to, ferns, non-invasive grasses, forbs, aquatic plants, trees and shrubs in a landscape when these plants were obtained not in violation of local, state or federal laws, regulations or orders.

A-weighted level or A used in conjunction with dB is the total sound level of all sounds as measured with a sound level meter using the "A" weighting network as defined in American National Standards Specification for sound level meters, S1.4-1971. The unit is the dBA. 
Ambient sound level means the sound pressure level of all-encompassing sounds associated with a given environment, being a composite of many sounds. For the purpose of this article, such term is the sound pressure level exceeded 90 percent of the time, based upon a measurement of not less than ten minutes and excluding the alleged offensive sounds. 
Average sound level means a sound level typical of the sound levels observed at a certain place during a given period of time averaged by the general rule of combination for sound levels, such general rule being set forth in ANSI specifications for sound level meters. "Average sound level" is also called "equivalent continuous sound level (Leq)." 
Band pressure level of a sound for a specified frequency band means the sound pressure level for the sound contained within the restricted band. 
Commercial purpose means and includes the use, operation or maintenance of any sound-amplifying equipment for the purpose of advertising any business, any goods or any services, or for the purpose of attracting the attention of the public to, or advertising for, or soliciting patronage or customers to or for any performance, show, entertainment, exhibition or event, or for the purpose of demonstrating any such sound equipment. 
Cycle means the complete sequence of values of a periodic quantity which occurs during a period. 
Daytime means the hours from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 
Decibel or dB is a unit of level which denotes the ratio between two quantities which are proportional to power; the number of decibels corresponding to the ratio of two amounts of power is ten times the logarithm to the base ten of this ratio. 
Frequency of a function periodic in time means the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the cycle per unit time and shall be specified. 
Motor vehicle includes but is not limited to minibikes and go-carts. 
Nighttime means the hours from 10:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. of the following day.

(b)  Correction for ambient conditions. Where the ambient sound level influences a measurement at a property boundary, such sound will be accounted for by applying the following correction factors: 
TABLE 2 
If the ambient sound level is less than the sound source by: 	Add the following to the sound limit: 
0—1 dBA 	3 dBA 
2—3 dBA 	2 dBA 
4—9 dBA 	1 dBA 
 
If the ambient sound level is greater than the sound limit, the sound source shall not be allowed to exceed the ambient level. 
(Code 1973, § 11.14.060; Ord. No. 39-90, pt. 4, 5-7-91)  
Sec. 42-130. - Method of measuring sound. 
(a)  Equipment. Sound measurement shall be made with a sound level meter manufactured according to the specifications of the American National Standards Institute, USA Standard Specifications for General Purpose Sound Level Meters (S1.4-1971) and Preferred Center Frequencies for Acoustical Measurements (S1.6-1960), or any subsequent nationally adopted standards superseding the above standards. 
(b)  Location and interpretation. Sound measurement shall be made at the nearest lot line of premises from which sound complaints are received and shall be made at a height of at least three feet above the ground and at least three feet away from walls, barriers, obstructions or sound reflective surfaces. Where the nature of the sound level permits, the slow response setting shall be used to obtain the sound level on the sound level meter. 
(Code 1973, § 11.14.070)  
Sec. 42-131. - Sound nuisances where sound level measurements are not practical. 
(a)  Certain sounds are generated by electrical or mechanical equipment which due to the nature of their method of generation, such as random or unpredictable times of occurrence, are impractical to measure to determine compliance to the community sound standards as described in sections 42-127, 42-129, and 42-130. Where such sounds occur and cause a serious disturbance to neighborhoods, an alternate method of processing and relief should be applied. 
Upon receipt of a written petition concerning such nuisances, signed by two or more affected adult persons from separate households or occupancies, the health officer or his designee may commence prosecution on information and belief. The health officer in such cases shall issue an order on the alleged violator setting forth that a complaint has been received, the nature of the complaint and a notification that production of excessive and nuisance sounds are a violation of the Code and may be prosecuted for relief. 
(b)  Following issuance of a notification of a sound nuisance under this section, a reasonable time for compliance, and the receipt of another complaint that the noise continues to cause a disturbance, the health officer or designee shall arrange for such case to be reviewed by the office of the city attorney. No person shall be convicted under the provisions of this section except upon testimony of at least one of the affected adult persons. 
(Code 1973, § 11.14.075)  
Sec. 42-132. - Variance permits. 
Variance permits may be issued by the health officer to exceed the sound standards set forth in this article, as follows: 
(1)  Temporary variance permits. 
a.  Generally. A temporary variance permit may be issued upon request provided that the work producing such sound is necessary to promote the public health and/or welfare and reasonable steps are taken to keep such sound at the lowest possible practical level. 
b.  Special community events. A temporary variance permit may be issued for special events, such as circuses, Fourth of July celebrations and similar community events which are limited in duration, provided that precautions are taken to maintain the sounds produced at the lowest practical level. Such variance permits shall not be issued for block parties. 
c.  Application procedure. Applications for temporary variance permits must be made in writing to the health officer and shall contain all of the following pertinent information: 
1.  Date requested. 
2.  Type of event. 
3.  Time and place of operation. 
4.  Equipment and operation involved. 
5.  Necessity for such permit. 
6.  Steps to be taken to minimize noise. 
7.  Name of responsible person who will be present at the operation site while the noise is produced. 
(2)  Variance permits of indefinite duration. 
a.  It is recognized that it is not technically or economically feasible for certain business operations and equipment to comply with the standards set forth in this article as of the date of this article. The health officer shall therefore issue a variance permit on existing business operations and equipment which produce excessive sound if it is found that it is not technically or economically feasible to alter such operations to reduce sound to within the prescribed standards set forth in this article. Applications for such variances must be made to the health officer by an affected party in a letter setting forth the reasons that such variance should be granted. The health officer, after review of all circumstances and the degree of nuisance, shall reply in writing giving the variance, denying the variance or setting forth conditions or limitations under which the variance will be granted. 
b.  If the health officer issues an order citing a violation of this article on an existing business operation and equipment and the party cited applies for a variance within ten days of such citation, then all penalties provided shall be tolled from the date the application is filed until a final order or decision has been issued on the merits of the application. 
(3)  Fees. The fee per day for a temporary variance permit under subsection (1) above shall be as set forth in the fee schedule as established by the common council. 
(Code 1973, § 11.14.080; Ord. No. 18-00, pt. 1, 9-20-00; Ord. No. 0028-19, pt. 78, 11-12-19)

a.  The funds for the services are included in the approved city budget. 
b.  The city has engaged in a competitive selection process for professional services (or in the case of the water and wastewater utilities, Wis.

The contract is for a period of one year or less, or the contract is for a period of more than one year but not more than three years, and the cost of the professional services does not average more than $50,000.00 per year of the contract, provided that this subsection is subject to subsection (3)b. for noncompetitive contracts.

Sec. 46-41. - Racine Works Program. 
(a)  Purpose. U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that the unemployment rate in the City of Racine is one of the highest in the state and is consistently higher than other parts of the State of Wisconsin. The City of Racine Common Council finds that the high unemployment rate, especially among low and moderate income groups, has a substantial adverse impact on the social and economic fiber of the entire community. The Racine Works Program is designed and intended to reduce unemployment by creating work opportunities for Racine residents and by retaining current jobs of residents through imposition of a requirement that, for certain public works contracts, a designated percent of hours worked under the contract be performed by qualified low-income Racine residents. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words and phrases have the meaning indicated for this section: 
Direct financial assistance means the value of below-market land sales, any direct subsidies to developers, and city expenditures for private improvements, with a combined value of $1 million or more, as determined by the director of city development, targeted specifically to a project. It includes the value of tax increment financing and below-market-rate loans provided by the city. 
Eligible resident means an individual who resides in the City of Racine, Wisconsin, for contracts awarded by the city, or an individual who resides in a municipality served by the water utility for water utility contracts and whose income does not exceed the area Housing and Urban Development (HUD) income limits set forth for low- or very low-income households, as of the date of hire, which is 80 percent of the county median income, as determined annually by HUD. Such residents shall have completed at a minimum a pre-apprentice program geared toward a specific trade. Residents who possess an apprenticeship or journeyman status shall also be eligible provided their current income status make them eligible. 
Racine Works Program (RWP) means the residents' preference program created and implemented in this section. 
Qualified low income resident means a person who has completed a pre-apprentice, apprentice, or journeyman program or status in a particular trade such as carpentry, cement finishing, iron worker, plumbing, electrical, and similar trades. Qualifying contract means (1) a public works contract, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 66.0901(1)(c), awarded by the city or its water utility in an amount greater than $200,000.00 and is paid by city source funds for city public works contracts or by water utility funds for water utility contracts, (2) a contract for site preparation, including, but not limited to, razing of buildings, filling, grading, and other similar work, or (3) a construction contract or contract for site preparation awarded by a developer for a development that received direct financial assistance from the city or from the community development. A contract shall constitute a qualifying contract irrespective of the funding source to the fullest extent possible considering the requirements of state and federal law. 
Qualifying work means all labor, including skilled and non-skilled labor, and including but not limited to, general laborer, labor performed in journeyman, sub-journey, pre-apprenticeship, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs. 
Worker hours means the total hours qualifying work performed pursuant to a qualifying contract, whether those workers are employed by the contractor or any subcontractor. In determining the total worker hours to be furnished at a construction site, the number of hours devoted to all tasks customarily performed on a construction site shall be included, whether or not such tasks are performed on the construction site. Worker hours includes work performed by persons filling apprenticeships and participating in on-the-job training programs and work performed by supervisors and superintendents on job sites who are not hourly wage workers. 
(c)  Applicability; exceptions. RWP applies to all qualifying contracts, excepting that in exceptional circumstances where the commissioner of public works for department of public works contracts, or the general manager of the water utility for water utility contracts, determines that substantial grounds exist to exempt a contract from RWP, such as where a contract requires special skill or experience, then the commissioner of public works for department of public works contracts or the general manager of the water utility for water utility contracts, may exempt such contracts from RWP. 
(d)  Worker hours requirement. Contractors performing work under a non-exempt qualifying contract shall employ or ensure employment of eligible residents in the work under such contract and subcontracts to the extent that eligible residents perform qualifying work in the amount of 20 percent of the total worker hours. 
(e)  Verification; documentation. The contractor shall, upon completion of each non-exempt qualifying contract, and before final payment under the contract is requested, certify by affidavit whether it has complied with RWP. Such affidavit shall include the name, street address, municipality of residence, race, gender, and total hours worked of each employee used for the contract, including such records of subcontractors for work under subcontracts. Such certification shall submit such affidavit to the city affirmative action/human rights officer. Contractors shall maintain personnel records listing the name, address, race, and gender of each employee used for the contract as well as payroll records that provide information from which compliance with RWP requirements can be determined, including such records of subcontractors for work of eligible residents under the subcontract. The contractor shall provide such documents to city upon reasonable notice during the pendency of the contract and shall maintain such payroll records for a period of at least three years after city's final payment under the contract. Contractors and subcontractors shall permit a city representative to engage in on-the-job interviews with employees to assist in determining compliance with RWP. 
(f)  Administration. RWP shall be administered by the city affirmative action/human rights officer, who shall provide prospective contractors with information regarding RWP, with forms required for compliance certification, who shall also determine compliance with RWP requirements. The affirmative action/human rights officer shall, on a semi-annual basis, provide the common council with information regarding RWP and the common council shall review the program and determine whether to enact revisions to RWP. 
(g)  Prohibition and penalty. No contractor or agent thereof shall fail to employ and use on non-exempt qualifying contracts eligible residents for at least the percent of qualifying work specified in this section. Upon failure of a contractor or agent to timely submit the affidavit required under paragraph (e), above, such contractor or agent shall be prohibited from bidding on any qualifying contract until such affidavit is submitted. Upon failure of a contract or agent thereof to fail to employ and use on non-exempt contracts eligible residents for at least the percent of qualifying work specified in this section, such contractor or agent thereof may be cited for such failure. Upon conviction, such person shall forfeit $10,000, or two and one-half percent of the total cost of the qualifying contract as awarded, whichever is greater, plus statutory court costs. 
(h)  Debarment. If after recommendation of the public works and services committee, the due process board determines that a contractor or agent thereof has failed to employ eligible residents under a non-exempt qualifying contract in the percentage required in this section, or if upon recommendation of the general manager of the water utility, the due process board finds that a contractor or agent thereof has failed to employ eligible residents under a non-exempt qualifying contract in the percentage specified in this section, the common council, for department of public works contracts, and the water works commission, for water utility contracts, may not award any contract to such person unless otherwise recommended by the public works and services committee and approved by the common council or recommended by such general manager and approved by the water works commission, respectively, or unless three years have elapsed from the date the due process board made its determination, or three years have elapsed from the date of final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that is adverse to the contractor, whichever is later.

(Ord. No. 10-08, pt. 1, 6-1-10)  
Sec. 62-48. - Enforcement procedures. 
The commission shall use the following procedures in acting on complaints of discrimination under article IIB: 
(1)  The department shall, within three days of receipt of a complaint, serve notice on the complainant, and on the aggrieved person if different from the complainant, acknowledging the filing of the complaint and advising of the time limits and choice of forums provided under this subsection and the right to bring a private civil action under subsection (13). 
(2)  Upon the filing of an initial, amended, final, or supplemental complaint, the department shall, within five days, serve a copy of the complaint upon the respondent, except where testing may be conducted. The initial complaint shall be served before the commencement of the investigation by the department, except where testing may be conducted. The notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice to the respondent shall include a written statement from the department directing the respondent to respond in writing to the allegations in the complaint within 20 days after the date of the notice and further stating that, if the respondent fails to answer the complaint in writing, the department will make an initial determination as to whether discrimination has occurred based only on the department's investigation and the information supplied by the complainant. 
(3)  The department shall conduct an initial investigation of the complaint. The department may test as part of this investigation for the purpose of establishing violations of this chapter. The results of such initial investigation shall be reported to the commission no later than at its first regularly scheduled meeting after 20 days after the date of service of the complaint upon the respondent. The commission may dismiss a no probable cause complaint at such meeting or thereafter. If the commission does not dismiss the complaint at such meeting, the department shall, within five days of such meeting, serve a copy of the complaint upon the respondent. 
(4)  The commission may dismiss the complaint if the complainant fails to respond to the department within 20 days from the date of mailing of any correspondence from the department concerning the complaint, if the department's correspondence requests a response, and if the correspondence is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the complainant. 
(5)  The commission and its duly authorized agents may hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, take testimony, and make investigations as provided in this subsection. The commission may order the full range of discovery available in civil actions for the purpose of its investigations and hearings. The department, with the approval of the commission, shall develop and implement an investigation manual for use in conducting investigations. 
a.  Under no circumstances may an individual member of the commission undertake an investigation independent of any commission or department investigation. 
b.  At the end of each investigation under this section, the commission shall prepare a final investigative report containing: 
1.  The names and dates of contacts with witnesses; 
2.  A summary and the dates of correspondence and other contacts with the aggrieved person and the respondent; 
3.  A summary description of other pertinent records; 
4.  A summary of witness statements; and 
5.  Answers to interrogatories. 
A final report under this subsection may be amended if additional evidence is later discovered. 
(6)  Subcommittee. 
a.  The commission shall appoint a subcommittee of three commissioners to investigate all complaints that allege a fair housing violation and that are timely filed. The subcommittee may subpoena persons or documents and order discovery for the purpose of investigation. If during an investigation it appears that the respondent has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in discrimination against the complainant, or an aggrieved person, that is not alleged in the complaint, the commission or the subcommittee may advise the complainant that the complaint should be amended. If the complaint is amended, the subcommittee shall also investigate the allegations of the amended complaint. 
b.  At the conclusion of the investigation of the allegations, the subcommittee shall make a determination as to whether probable cause exists to believe that discrimination has occurred or is about to occur. 
1.  If the subcommittee determines that probable cause exists, the subcommittee shall immediately issue a charge on behalf of the aggrieved person and refer the charge to the city attorney. The city attorney shall represent the aggrieved person at the hearing under subsection (8) or, if an election is made under subsection (6)d., shall commence a civil action in the name of the state on behalf of the aggrieved person under subsection (13). 
2.  If the subcommittee initially determines that there is no probable cause to believe that discrimination occurred as alleged in the complaint, it may dismiss those allegations. The department shall, by a notice to be served with the determination, notify the parties of the complainant's right to appeal the dismissal of the claim to the commission for a hearing on the issue under subsection (9). Service of the determination shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
c.  Service of copies of the charge shall be made on the complainant, the respondent, and the aggrieved person by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
d.  After a charge is filed, a complainant, a respondent, or an aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed may elect to have the claims asserted in that charge decided in a civil action under subsection (13) in lieu of a hearing under subsection (8). The election shall be made no later than 20 days after the receipt by the electing person of service of the charge, along with information about how to make the election. If an election is made, the person making the election shall give notice of doing so to the commission and to all other complainants and respondents to whom the charge relates. The commission shall notify the aggrieved persons that an election is made. Not later than 30 days after the election is made, the city attorney shall commence and maintain, a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person in Racine County Circuit Court seeking relief under this article. Any aggrieved person with respect to the issues to be determined in a civil action under this article may intervene as of right in that civil action. 
e.  No charge may be issued regarding alleged discrimination after the beginning of a the trial of a civil action commenced by the aggrieved party under subsection (13) or 42 USC 3613, seeking relief with respect to that discriminatory act. 
(7)  Temporary judicial relief or conciliation. 
a.  At any time after a complaint is filed alleging fair housing discrimination, the commission may request the city attorney file a petition in the circuit court for the county in which the act of discrimination allegedly occurred or for the county in which a respondent resides or transacts business, seeking a temporary injunction or restraining order against the respondent to prevent the respondent from performing an act that would tend to render ineffectual an order that the department may enter with respect to the complaint, pending final determination of proceedings under this section. On receipt of the commission's request, the city attorney shall promptly file the petition and maintain such action. 
b.  Upon the filing of a complaint alleging fair housing discrimination, the department shall endeavor, to the extent feasible, to eliminate the discrimination by conference, conciliation and persuasion. The department shall notify the parties that conciliation services are available. 
c.  Conciliation efforts may be undertaken by the city conflict resolution center during the period beginning with the filing of the complaint and ending with the dismissal of the complaint under subsection (6)b.2. or the issuance of a charge under subsection (6)b.1. 
d.  If conciliation resolves the dispute, a written conciliation agreement shall be prepared that shall state all measures to be taken by each party. The agreement may provide for dismissal of the complaint if the dismissal is without prejudice to the complainant's right to pursue the complaint against any respondent who fails to comply with the terms of the agreement. The agreement shall be signed by the respondent, the complainant, and the aggrieved person and is subject to approval by the commission. A conciliation agreement entered into under this subdivision is a public record and is subject to inspection under Wis. Stats. § 19.35, unless the parties to the agreement request that the record be exempt from disclosure and the commission finds that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this article. 
e.  Whenever the commission has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the commission shall refer the matter to the city attorney with a recommendation that a civil action be filed for enforcement of the agreement. 
f.  Nothing said or done in the course of conciliation hereunder may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the written consent of the persons concerned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commission shall make available to the aggrieved person and the respondent, at any time, upon request following completion of the commission's investigation, information derived from an investigation and any final investigative report relating to that investigation. 
(8)  Hearing procedures. 
a.  After a subcommittee issues a charge under subsection (6)b.1., the department shall serve the charge, along with a written notice of hearing, specifying the nature and acts of discrimination that appear to have been committed, and requiring the respondent to answer the charge at a hearing before the commission. The notice shall specify a time of hearing, not less than ten days after service of the charge and a place of hearing. 
b.  If an election to file a civil action is not made under subsection (6)d., the hearing shall be conducted by the commission. 
1.  The aggrieved person on whose behalf the charge was issued shall be represented by the city attorney unless such person elects to be represented by privately-retained counsel.

e.  The testimony at the hearing shall be recorded by the commission. The hearing under this paragraph shall be conducted as expeditiously and inexpensively as possible, consistent with the needs and rights of the parties to obtain a fair hearing and a complete record. The burden of proof is on the party alleging discrimination.

d.  The department shall make final administrative disposition of a complaint within one year after the date of receipt of a complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the department is unable to do so, it shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so. 
(10)  Damages and penalties. 
a.  If the commission finds that a respondent has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in a discriminatory act prohibited under this chapter, the commission shall promptly issue an order for such relief as may be appropriate, which may include economic and noneconomic damages suffered by the aggrieved person, regardless of whether he or she intervened in the action, and injunctive or other equitable relief. The commission may not order punitive damages. 
b.  In addition to any damages ordered under subsection a, the commission may assess a forfeiture against a respondent as provided in section 1-15, plus the costs of prosecution. Such forfeiture may be assessed on a daily basis for each and every day such violation shall continue without limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a respondent has been adjudged to have committed one other discriminatory act under this article during the preceding five-year period, based on the offense date of the prior discriminatory act, the commission may assess a daily-basis forfeiture against a respondent as provided in section 1-15, plus the costs of prosecution, and shall assess an additional forfeiture in an amount not exceeding $25,000.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a respondent has been adjudged to have committed two or more prior other discriminatory act under this article during the preceding seven-year period, based on the offense date of the prior discriminatory act, the commission may assess a daily-basis forfeiture against a respondent as provided in section 1-15, plus the costs of prosecution, and shall assess an additional forfeiture in an amount not exceeding $50,000.00. 
(11)  Attorney fees and costs. The commission may allow a prevailing plaintiff, including the city, reasonable attorney fees and costs. The city shall be liable for those fees and costs if the city is a respondent and is determined to have committed a discriminatory act. 
(12)  Judicial review. Within 30 days after service upon all parties of an order or determination of the commission under this article, the respondent, the complainant or the aggrieved party may appeal the order or the determination to the circuit court for the county in which the alleged discrimination took place by the filing of a petition for review. The court shall review the order or determination as provided in Wis. Stats. §§ 227.52 to 227.58. 
(13)  Civil actions. 
a.  Any person alleging a fair housing discrimination violation, including the city attorney on behalf of an aggrieved person, may bring a civil action for injunctive relief, for damages, including punitive damages, and, in the case of a prevailing plaintiff, for court costs and reasonable attorney fees. 
b.  An action commenced under subsection (13)a. may be brought in the circuit court for the county where the alleged violation occurred or for the county where the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has a principal place of business, and shall be commenced within one year after the alleged violation occurred or terminated. The one-year statute of limitations under this section shall be tolled while an administrative proceeding with respect to the same complaint is pending. 
c.  The court may issue a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order to assure the rights granted by this section. The court may order other relief that the court considers appropriate, including monetary damages, actual and punitive, a forfeiture as provided in subsection (10) and costs and fees as provided in subsection (11). 
(14)  Discrimination by licensed or chartered persons. 
a.  If the commission finds probable cause to believe that an act of discrimination has been or is being committed in violation of this article by a person and that the person is licensed or chartered by any governmental licensing or supervisory authority, the commission shall notify the licensing or chartering agency of its findings and may file a complaint with such agency together with a request that the agency initiate proceedings to suspend or revoke the license or charter of such person or take other less restrictive disciplinary action. 
b.  Upon filing a complaint under subsection (14)a., the commission shall make available to the appropriate licensing or chartering agency all pertinent documents and files in its custody, and shall cooperate fully with such agency in the agency's proceedings.

Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such a claim is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon the appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances makes it impracticable, a peace officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this subsection, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this subsection if the peace officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the actor was true and, if believed by the peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. 
(b)  No person shall loiter, loaf, wander, stand or remain idle either alone or in consort with others in a public place so as to obstruct any public street, highway, sidewalk or any other public place or building by hindering or impeding or tending to hinder or impede the free and uninterrupted passage of vehicles or pedestrians in such a manner that it is reasonable to believe will cause a threat to public safety or a breach of the peace.

(c)  In or near any thoroughfare or place open to the public, no person either individually or as part of a group shall procure or attempt to procure a handout from another in an aggressive or intimidating manner. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such purpose or behavior is manifested are the following: that such person is a known panhandler; that such person continues to beckon to, accost or follow or ask passer(s)-by for a handout after the passer(s)-by has failed to respond or has told the person "no"; that such person engages in a course of conduct or commits any act which harasses or intimidates the passer(s)-by; or that such person utilizes or attempts to utilize bodily gestures or physical contact to impede the path of any passer(s)-by, including but not limited to unwanted touching or blocking the path or impeding the free movement of the passer(s)-by.

No arrest shall be made for a violation of this subsection unless the arresting officer first affords such person an opportunity to explain such conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this subsection if it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful purpose. 
(d)  No person shall procure or attempt to procure a handout when either the procurer or the person being solicited is located at any of the following locations: at a bus stop; in any public transportation vehicle or public transportation facility; in a vehicle which is parked or stopped on a public street or alley; at a sidewalk cafe; or within 20 feet in any direction from an automatic teller machine or entrance to a bank.

Sec. 66-421. - Declaration of findings and purpose. 
It is hereby declared that the protection and preservation of the home is the keystone of democratic government; that the public health and welfare and the good order of the community require that members of the community enjoy in their homes and dwellings a feeling of well-being, tranquility and privacy, and when absent from their home, the assurance that they may return to the enjoyment of their homes and dwellings; that the practice of picketing before or about residences and dwellings causes emotional disturbance and distress to the occupants; obstructs and interferes with the free use of public sidewalks and public ways of travel; that such practice has as its object the harassing of such occupants; and without resort to such practice full opportunity exists, and under the terms and provisions of this article will continue to exist for the exercise of freedom of speech and other constitutional rights; and that the provisions enacted in this article are necessary for the public interest to avoid the detrimental results set forth in this section and are enacted by the common council pursuant to the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 62.11(5). 
(Code 1973, § 25.16.010)  
Sec. 66-422. - Picketing of residences prohibited. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual. 
(Code 1973, § 25.16.020)  
Sec. 66-423. - Picketing of certain businesses prohibited. 
(a)  Purpose. It is well recognized that most of the elected officials now residing within the city are part-time elected officials, who maintain their basic livelihood by being engaged in either private business or private employment. Whenever any persons choose to picket or demonstrate the private business establishments of these elected officials because of a dispute with such elected official in his public capacity, there is a tendency to unfairly coerce and intimidate the decision making of such public official by attempting to cut off his means of earning a livelihood. This type of coercion would tend to destroy the organized representative government upon which this country is based, as well as to impair the desire of citizens to seek public office. It is, therefore, necessary to enact legislation to prohibit this type of coercive activity in an effort to preserve our democratic form of government. 
(b)  Picketing of businesses prohibited. It shall be unlawful for anyone to picket or induce others to picket the business establishment or place of employment, including its employees, its supply or delivery vehicles, or the customers of such business or place of employment, of any elected public official whose business and/or place of employment is located in the city when no labor dispute exists between the elected public official in his capacity as a private businessman or employee and his employees or employer. The term "labor dispute" as used in this section shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Wis. Stats. § 103.62(3). The prohibitions of this section shall in no way restrict lawful picketing, boycotting or any other legal demonstration when carried out pursuant to private enterprise labor relations disputes. The provisions of this section shall in no way prohibit the picketing of elected officials at their elective governmental offices.

ARTICLE XXVI. - PURCHASE OR POSSESSION OF VAPOR PRODUCTS BY A MINOR PROHIBITED 
 
Sec. 66-675. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the property and persons in the City of Racine by prohibiting persons under 18 years of age from possessing nicotine and vapor products, and prohibiting the sale of these products to persons under 18 years of age. 
(b)  Over the last few years, the popularity of electronic cigarettes has increased substantially, particularly among the youth population. Electronic cigarettes are tobacco-less handheld devices that allow its user to simulate cigarette smoking, and are also commonly referred to as "electronic cigarettes," "e-cigarettes," "e-cigars," "e-cigarillos," "e-pipes," "e-hookahs," or "electronic nicotine delivery systems." For purposes of this section, all of these electronic smoking devices are referred to as an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS). 
(c)  ENDS vary in their appearance and specific method of operation, although they do have a few basic elements in common. The devices work by heating up an "e-liquid" that generates an aerosol or vapor to be inhaled by its user. These e-liquid solutions typically contain nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerine and other flavorings. The concentration of nicotine contained in the solution can be customized by the retailer to the buyer's specifications, and many manufacturers make nicotine-free solutions. 
(d)  ENDS often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products. These devices may be manufactured to look like conventional cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Some resemble pens or USB flash drives. Larger devices, such as tank systems or mods, bear little or no resemblance to cigarettes. Currently, these products come in many different flavors that appeal to young people. 
(e)  The U.S. Food and Drug Administrative (FDA) currently regulates the manufacture, import, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of all electronic nicotine delivery systems and prohibits the sale of such products to persons under 18 years of age. Under Wisconsin law, persons under 18 years of age are prohibited from purchasing or possessing cigarettes, tobacco products, or nicotine products, and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors. Wisconsin law, however, does not currently regulate nicotine-free vapor products or prohibit the sale of such products to persons under 18 years of age. 
(f)  Existing studies on vapor emissions and the cartridge contents of electronic smoking devices have found a number of dangerous substances including: 
(1)  Chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead, nickel and chromium; 
(2)  PM 2.5, acrolein, tin, toluene, and aluminum, which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, neurological effects, damage to reproductive systems, and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke. 
(g)  Some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution, thereby creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine. 
(h)  Clinical studies regarding the safety and efficacy of such products have not been submitted to the FDA for the over 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason, consumers have no way of knowing whether electronic smoking devices are safe, what types of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain, and what dose of nicotine the products deliver. 
(i)  Despite current FDA rules banning the sale of such products to persons under 18 years of age, the use of e-cigarettes and similar devices by middle and high school students have continued to increase significantly in recent years. 
(j)  The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke-free locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverses the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment. 
(k)  It is the intent of the common council, in enacting the ordinance codified in this section, to provide for the public health, safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smoke-free air laws; by reducing the potential for re-normalizing smoking in public places and places of employment; by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle; and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices to minors. 
(l)  Therefore, the City of Racine Common Council determines that prohibiting the sale, giving, or furnishing of electronic nicotine delivery systems and vapor products to minors and prohibiting the purchase, possession, or use of such products by minors is in the city's best interest and will promote public health, safety, and welfare.

(Ord. No. 29-03, pt. 1, 12-16-03; Ord. No. 0015-17, pt. 1, 10-16-17; Ord. No. 0022-19, pt. 3B., 11-12-19)  
Sec. 66-1003. - Chronic nuisances prohibited. 
(a)  Findings and purpose. The Common Council of the City of Racine finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Racine in the activities happening on, within, and surrounding certain commercial and residential premises in violation of the City of Racine Municipal Code of Ordinances, all of which interfere with the public's interest in the quality of life and total community environment, tone of commerce, and property and neighborhood values. Nuisance activities contribute to the general decay of affected neighborhoods and negatively impact residents in those neighborhoods. The common council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the City of Racine and of the businesses thereof and visitors thereto. 
The common council finds that certain commercial and residential premises in the City of Racine require a disproportionate amount of resources from the City of Racine's various departments to be devoted to addressing nuisance activities and violations of the City of Racine Municipal Code of Ordinances that occur thereon. A chronic nuisance is a public nuisance. The common council finds that any premises that has generated three or more responses from the police department within a 90-day period or three or more responses from other code enforcement officers within a 180-day period for public nuisance activities has received more than the level of general and adequate police service and has placed an undue and inappropriate burden on the taxpayers of the city. Often this disproportionate devotion of city resources is due to property owners' own actions or the failure of property owners to accept and exercise sufficient responsibility for and over the actions of occupants, guests, agents, employees, or other persons associated with the premises that reside within or frequent the premises. 
The common council further finds that premises owners and occupants conducting business activities upon the premises, who chronically fail to control the use of their property, substantially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life, health and safety of the community. This section is enacted to encourage property owners to recognize their responsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their property conform to the law and do not unduly burden the city's resources, to provide a mechanism for the city to take action against property owners who fail to abate nuisance activities occurring on their premises, and to recover the costs associated any disproportionate devotion of city resources devoted to addressing nuisance activities. 
The common council therefore directs the chief of police, chief of fire, public health administrator, chief building inspector, zoning administrator, city attorney, city assessor, city forester, weed commissioner, or their designees, as provided in this section, to charge the owners of such premises the costs associated with abating the nuisance activities that occur thereon. 
(b)  Determination of chronic nuisance premises. Whenever the minimum criteria for a chronic nuisance premises has been met, the code enforcement officer shall determine from the facts of each incident and considering the purpose of this section as set forth in paragraph (a), whether the premises is a chronic nuisance premises. The code enforcement officer(s), in making a determination, shall consider, among other factors, whether the nuisance activities resulting in numerous city responses were reported by the owner of the premises in an effort to abate the problems at the premises and whether the nuisance activity was committed by a person having no association with the premises by acquaintance with, relation to, or expressed or implied invitation from the owner, occupant, operator, or agent of the premises. If the code enforcement officer determines that there exists a chronic nuisance premises and that further action is necessary by the code enforcement officer's department in order to abate the nuisance, the code enforcement officer shall notify the owner of the property that it has been deemed a chronic nuisance premises. 
(c)  Notice of chronic nuisance premises. The notice shall contain the street address or legal description sufficient for identifying the premises, a description or list of the nuisance activities that have occurred at the premises, a statement that the owner shall, within ten days of the notice, respond to the code enforcement officer who issued the notice in writing and propose an abatement plan, and the potential penalties for failing to reply, including a statement indicating that the cost of future enforcement may be assessed as a special charge against the premises. Such notice shall be delivered by regular mail to the address on file with the city assessor's office. If the owner cannot be located, the notice shall be published as a class 2 notice under Wis. Stats. ch. 985 and a copy left at the premises. 
(d)  Owner abatement. The owner or responsible party shall respond in writing within ten days of the notice with a specific proposal to abate the nuisance activities at the premises. The code enforcement officer may accept, reject, or work with the owner to modify the proposal at his or her discretion. If the owner contacts the code enforcement officer and presents a proposal to abate the nuisance and initiates action in accordance with that abatement plan, the code enforcement officer may delay further enforcement of this article until the code enforcement officer determines that the abatement plan or written course of action has failed or is no longer acceptable. 
(e)  Notice of intent to pursue remedies. If the owner fails to contact the code enforcement officer or present an acceptable abatement plan within the time frame provided, or at any time fails to follow through with an accepted course of action or abatement plan, the code enforcement officer shall notify the owner of its decision to pursue one or more remedies under section 66-1003(f) as a result of the chronic nuisance premises determination and the right to appeal pursuant to section 66-1003(g). Delivery of this second notice shall be made in the same manner as the notice in section 66-1003(c). 
(f)  Remedies and forfeitures. 
(1)  Costs of abatement. The code enforcement officer may calculate any and all costs, fees, and other expenses (collectively "expenditures") incurred by the city arising from and/or pertaining to city services and resources used for responding and preventing the nuisance activities at the premises, including, but not limited to, actual burdened labor, overtime, materials, vehicle use, and related administrative time and efforts incurred and for any subsequent city expenditures for the same, including subsequent enforcement actions, and invoice the owner of the real property for such services and resources, beginning on the date of the notice of intent to pursue remedies under section 66-1003(e). Until the chronic nuisance has been abated, the code enforcement officer may continue to calculate and invoice the owner for any and all expenditures to abate nuisance activities. The relevant code enforcement officer shall keep an accurate calculation of the expenditures and shall report it to the finance director. An unpaid invoice may be a lien on such premises and such costs may be assessed against the real property for services rendered and incurred by the city to enjoin or abate the public nuisance as a special charge under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627, unless paid within 30 days of the date on the invoice. 
(2)  Violations and forfeitures. It shall be a violation for any person to fail to abate any chronic nuisance after receiving a notice to pursue remedies. If after sending out the notice to pursue remedies under section 66-1003(e) the chronic nuisance has not been abated, the code enforcement officer may also issue a complaint or citation against the property owner or occupant for every nuisance activity thereafter associated with the premises until the chronic nuisance has been abated. A person in violation of this section shall forfeit not less than $500.00 for the first offense, $750.00 for the second offense, and $1,000.00 for any subsequent offense within one year. Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate offense. 
(3)  Upon declaring a chronic nuisance property, the code enforcement officer shall also refer the matter to the city attorney's office to determine if a nuisance action under Wis. Stats. ch. 823 is appropriate and to the public safety and licensing committee to determine if a review of the licensed premises is appropriate. 
(g)  Appeal. A property owner or occupant who receives notice pursuant to sections 66-1003(c) and (e) that his or her premises is a chronic nuisance premises or that the code enforcement officer intends to pursue remedies against him or her, may appeal the code enforcement officer's decision within ten days from the date of the notice. 
(1)  The appeal shall be in writing and must be delivered to the code enforcement officer who issued the chronic nuisance premises notice or his or her designee as indicated in the code enforcement officer's letter. As soon as practicable thereafter, but not more than 30 days from the date of the written appeal, the due process board shall hear the appeal and allow the property owner or occupant an opportunity to present evidence as to why the premises is not a chronic nuisance premises under the ordinance. In doing so, the chairman may allow testimony from any member of the audience having relevant first-hand knowledge regarding the issues at hand. 
(2)  Within ten days after the appeal is heard, the property owner or occupant shall be notified in writing of the board's decision to either reverse or deny the code enforcement officer's chronic nuisance determination. Any person adversely affected by a decision of the due process board in this respect may seek review by filing a petition in circuit court within 30 days of the date of the decision or be forever barred. 
(3)  For purposes of this section, the city elects not to be bound by Wis. Stats. ch. 68 with respect to administrative procedure. 
(h)  When a chronic nuisance is deemed abated. The public nuisance created by a chronic nuisance premises shall be deemed abated when no police calls for service or for nuisance activities have been made to the premises and no enforcement action has been taken against any person associated with the premises for a period of 90 days and the code enforcement officer or designee thereof deems the property to be in compliance with the abatement plan, if any, and this code. 
(i)  Subsequent notice of nuisance activities. Nothing in this section shall prevent or prohibit a code enforcement officer from issuing or reissuing a notice regarding subsequent nuisance activity or activities that may constitute a chronic nuisance premises. 
(j)  Other methods not excluded. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the abatement of public nuisances by the city or its officials in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, including, but not limited to, an action under Wis. Stats. ch. 823. 
(k)  Departmental independence. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring any city department to undertake any enforcement action set forth herein independently of any other city department. 
(l)  Severability. If any section of this article is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the validity of the remaining sections shall not be affected.

Sec. 66-1004. - Eviction or retaliation prohibited. 
It shall be unlawful for a landlord to terminate the lease agreement or periodic tenancy, increase charges, directly or indirectly to impose upon any tenant any property inspection or reinspection fee, reduce services, refuse to renew a rental agreement, or otherwise retaliate against any tenant because that tenant complained to any city department about nuisance activities or code violations on the landlord's premises or threaten to do the same. It shall be unlawful for a landlord, or any person acting as an agent for the landlord, to intimidate or actively discourage a tenant, and/or persons associated with a tenant, from calling or contacting any city department to report a nuisance activity or code violation associated with a premises or threaten to do the same. No non-owner occupant of a premises that has been found to be in violation of the City of Racine Municipal Code of Ordinances shall be evicted or retaliated against for having notified a city department of the existence of nuisance activities or code violations. 
It shall be a rebuttable presumption that any act or attempt by a landlord to initiate any of the aforesaid unlawful activities within six months of notification of the nuisance activities or code violations is done in retaliation and is void and is subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100.00 nor more than $2,000.00 for each such act or attempt. 
Such an occupant may be evicted for his or her failure to pay rent, or if the occupant commits waste upon the property, or if the occupant commits a substantial violation of a written rental agreement. In order to overcome such presumption, it must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence that such acts were based upon good cause. "Good cause" used herein means that the landlord must show a good reason for his or her action, other than one related to or caused by the operation of this ordinance or in response to increased costs related to the repair or correction of code violations, including but not limited to normal uniform rental increases due to utility increases or other increased costs to the landlord, or for other bona fide, nondiscriminatory business reason. This section shall not be read to prevent landlords from exercising their rights to evict a tenant consistent with local, state, and federal landlord tenant laws.

Footnotes:

Editor's note— Ord. No. 09-11, pt. 1, adopted Oct. 12, 2011, repealed Art. III in its entirety and enacted a new Art. III, § 74-66, 74-67. Former Art. III, § 74-66, 74-67, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1973, § 3.136.010; Ord. No. 19-00, pt. 1, adopted Sept. 20, 2000; Ord. No. 08-08, pt. 13, adopted June 3, 2008. 
 
Sec. 74-66. - Purpose; discipline; definitions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance for employees and supervisors concerning discipline of covered city employees. In addition, the purpose of this article is to establish a procedure to provide those city employees who are not covered by a grievance procedure as part of a collective bargaining agreement to resolve grievances while in the employ of the city. 
This procedure is intended to comply with Wis. Stats. § 66.0509, and provides a grievance procedure addressing issues concerning workplace safety, discipline, and termination. This procedure applies to all employees covered under Wis. Stats. § 66.0509, and excepts all police and fire employees subject to Wis. Stats. § 62.13(5). A covered employee may appeal any level of discipline under this grievance procedure. Any grievance filed under the article shall be filed on behalf of an individual employee. No grievance may be filed on behalf of more than one employee, a group of employees, or any collective bargaining unit. 
Nothing in this article is intended to create a legally binding contact between the city and covered employees or to change the at-will nature of employment for covered employees with the city. Employment with the city is voluntarily entered into and employees are free to resign at any time with or without cause. Similarly, the city may terminate the employment of any covered employee, at any time with or without cause, subject to applicable federal, state, or local law. The city reserves its management rights to exclusively manage its operations. 
(b)  Discipline. To the extent possible, it is in the best interests of the employees and the city to ensure fair treatment of all employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. 
Discipline may result when an employee's actions do not conform with generally accepted standards of good behavior, when an employee violates a policy or rule, when an employee's performance is not acceptable, or when the employee's conduct is detrimental to the interests of the city. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps - warning, reprimand, suspension (with or without pay) or termination of employment - depending on the problem and the number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed. Certain types of employee problems are serious enough to justify either a suspension or termination of employment without going through progressive discipline steps. The city reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to impose disciplinary action as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances. 
(c)  [Definitions.] For the purposes of this article, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  Discipline and disciplinary actions are actions taken to correct a problem or misbehavior, deter of further problems or misbehavior, prepare an employee for satisfactory service in the future, or separate an employee where an employee has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to perform satisfactory service. Approved discipline and disciplinary actions are: 
a.  Warning. Written documentation given to an employee describing specific disciplinary infractions, such as inappropriate conduct, poor performance, or violation of work rules/policies. Such documentation may include information regarding past infractions and what action will be taken if the employee fails to improve. A warning is the first step of formal discipline. 
b.  Reprimand. Written documentation given to an employee describing continuing or more serious specific disciplinary infractions, such as inappropriate conduct, poor performance, or violation of work rules/policies. Such documentation may include information regarding past infractions and shall include what action will be taken if the employee fails to improve. A reprimand is more serious than a warning. 
c.  Suspension. A disciplinary measure, including written documentation, in which employees are suspended without pay for a specified period of time due to violations including continuing or serious specific disciplinary infractions, such as inappropriate conduct, poor performance, or violation of work rules/policies. Such documentation shall include what action will be taken if the employee fails to improve. 
(2)  Employee discipline includes all levels of progressive discipline, but shall not include the following personnel actions: 
a.  Placing an employee on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation; 
b.  Counseling sessions, meetings, or other pre-disciplinary action, whether written or oral; 
c.  Actions taken to address work performance, including establishment and/or use of a performance improvement plan or job targets; 
d.  Demotion, transfer, or change in job assignment; or 
e.  Other personnel actions taken by the employer that are not a form of discipline. 
(3)  Employee termination shall include action taken by the employer to terminate an individual's employment for misconduct or performance reasons, but shall not include the following personnel actions: 
a.  Voluntary quit; 
b.  Layoff, furlough, or failure to be recalled from layoff at the expiration of the recall period; 
c.  Time lost because of a lack of work available to the employee; 
d.  Job abandonment, "no-call," "no-show," or other failure to report to work; 
f.  Termination of employment due to lack of qualification or license or other inability to perform job duties; or 
g.  Retirement. 
(3)  Workplace safety is defined as conditions of employment regarding employees' physical health or safety, and specifically including only: the safe operation of workplace equipment and tools, safety of the physical work environment, provision of personal protective equipment, workplace violence, and training related to same. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, pt. 1, 10-12-11)  
Sec. 74-67. - Filing of complaint; hearings; decisions. 
(a)  Procedure. Employees should first discuss complaints or questions with their immediate supervisor. Every reasonable effort should be made by supervisors and employees to resolve any questions, problems or misunderstandings that have arisen before filing a grievance. An employee whose complaint concerning the employee's discipline, termination, or workplace safety has not been resolved informally to the employee's satisfaction with the employee's immediate supervisor may obtain a review of the complaint under the following procedures: 
(1)  Step 1: Supervisor review. The employee shall reduce his complaint to writing, using the form prescribed by the human resources department, and submit it to the employee's immediate supervisor within 15 working days after the employee knew or should have known the cause of such grievance. Such complaint shall be referred to in this section as "the grievance." Any written grievance filed under this article must contain the following information: 
• The name and position of the employee filing it; 
• A statement of the issue involved; 
• A statement of the relief sought; 
• A detailed explanation of the facts supporting the grievance; 
• The specific date(s) the event(s) giving rise to the grievance took place; 
• The identity of the policy, procedure or rule that is being challenged; 
• The steps the employee has taken to review the matter, either orally or in writing, with the employee's supervisor; and 
• The employee's signature and the date. 
The supervisor shall answer the grievance within five working days. If the grievance is answered in a manner unsatisfactory to the employee, the employee may proceed to step 2. 
(2)  Step 2: Administrative manager review. If the grievance is not resolved at step 1, the employee may appeal the grievance to the employee's administrative manager within five working days of the receipt of the decision of the employee's supervisor at step 1. The administrative manager will review the matter and inform the employee of his/her decision, if possible, within ten working days of receipt of the grievance. 
(3)  Step 3: City administrator review. If the grievance is not resolved at step 2, the employee may appeal the grievance to the city administrator within five working days of the receipt of the decision of the administrative manager at step 2. The city administrator will review the matter and inform the employee of his/her decision, if possible, within ten working days of receipt of the grievance. 
(4)  Step 4: Impartial hearing officer. If the grievance is not resolved at step 3, the employee may request in writing, within five business days following receipt of the city administrator's decision, a request for review by an impartial hearing officer. 
a.  The parties shall, within ten business days, jointly request that the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission appoint an impartial hearing officer. The parties shall equally share the cost of the independent hearing officer, which payment shall be made at the same time as the request therefor. 
b.  In all cases, the grievant shall have the burden of proof to support the grievance. The impartial hearing officer will determine whether the city acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. This process does not involve a hearing equivalent to a hearing before a court of law. The rules of evidence will not be followed. 
c.  Depending on the issue involved, the impartial hearing officer will determine whether a hearing is necessary, or whether the case may be decided based on a submission of written documents. If the impartial hearing officer determines that a hearing is necessary, the parties shall attempt to agree in advance upon the issue involved and stipulate to facts to be used at the hearing. The independent hearing officer shall meet with the parties at the earliest possible date which can be set to review the evidence and hear testimony relating to the grievance. All such hearings shall be held at Racine City Hall. The impartial hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. 
d.  The impartial hearing officer may order either party to pay the entire amount of the independent hearing officer's fees upon such terms, and for such reasons, as the independent hearing officer finds appropriate and equitable. 
(5)  Step 5: Review by the common council. If the grievance is not resolved after step 4, the employee or the city administrator shall request, within five business days of receipt of the written decision from the hearing officer, a written review by the common council. The appeal shall be submitted as a communication to the common council, using a form prescribed by the human resources department, through the finance and personnel committee. The finance and personnel committee shall review the matter at its next regularly scheduled meeting, subject to the notice requirements of the open meetings law, and make a recommendation to the common council. The finance and personnel committee shall not take testimony or evidence; it may make a recommendation only upon a determination whether the hearing officer reached an arbitrary or incorrect result based on a review of the record before the hearing officer. The matter will be forwarded to the common council at its next regular meeting. The common council shall not take testimony or evidence; it may determine whether the hearing officer reached an arbitrary or incorrect result based on a review of the record before the hearing officer. The common council, through the city clerk, will inform the employee of its findings and decision in writing within ten working days of the common council meeting. A two-thirds vote of the common council shall be required to overturn the decision of the independent hearing officer. Absent such a supermajority vote, the decision of the independent hearing officer shall be affirmed. The decision of the common council shall be final and binding. 
(b)  An employee may not file a grievance outside of the time limits set forth above. If the employee fails to meet the deadlines set forth above, the grievance will be considered resolved. If it is impossible to comply with the deadlines due to meeting notice requirements or meeting preparation, the grievance will be reviewed at the next possible meeting date. An employee will conduct all activities related to preparing the grievance, other than delivering the grievance to the appropriate person as described in the various steps above, during nonworking hours and shall not otherwise be compensated for time spent in preparing his/her grievance. An employee shall not be permitted union representation at any stage in the grievance process. 
(c)  Administrative managers. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein any grievance by an administrative manager regarding discipline or workplace safety shall commence at step 3, using a form prescribed by the human resources department including the information required for step 1, above, within 15 working days after the employee knew or should have known the cause of such grievance. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein any grievance by an administrative manager regarding that administrative manager's termination based on a charge of official misconduct or inefficiency: 
(1)  Shall be initiated in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 17.16(3). 
(2)  Shall commence at step 4 as set forth above. 
(3)  If neither the employee nor the city appeals the decision of the impartial hearing officer, the common council shall affirm the decision of the impartial hearing office at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the time for appeal has expired, subject to the notice requirements of the open meetings law. 
(4)  If the employee or the city appeals the decision of the impartial hearing officer, such appeal shall be heard by the common council as follows: 
a.  Whenever any charge of official misconduct, malfeasance, or inefficiency shall be preferred against an administrative manager employed by the city, the common council shall proceed within 30 days, or such other time as agreed between the parties, after the charge so filed with the city clerk, to hear and determine the case upon its merits. 
b.  The mayor may suspend such officer against whom charges have been preferred until the disposition of the charges and appoint a person to fill the vacancy temporarily until the charges have been disposed of. 
c.  The common council may, for the purpose of such hearing, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of all papers by subpoena when necessary for the purpose of such hearing. 
d.  Two-thirds of all the members of the common council elect shall have the power to dismiss such administrative manager from office for malfeasance, misconduct, or inefficiency in office, upon due process hearing as provided in this section.

Sec. 82-56. - Findings. 
Numerous petitions for closing streets, alleys, ways and lands are received each year by the common council and it is essential that each of these matters be considered on an individual basis. However, many times this action is taken without consideration of what decisions have been made in similar circumstances in the past. Therefore, as guidelines, the following provisions shall be considered in the vacation of public streets, alleys, ways and lands. 
(Code 1973, § 9.38.010)  
Sec. 82-57. - Guidelines. 
The following guidelines should be considered in the vacation of public streets, alleys, ways and lands: 
(1)  That the subject area be vacated if one of the following is true and the constraints against the vacating or closing are minimal: 
a.  To use the subject area for another purpose. 
b.  To eliminate heavy through traffic on a minor street. 
c.  To eliminate an unneeded, unimproved, or dead-end street or public way. 
d.  To change the traffic pattern in accord with the master plan for the area. 
e.  If the situation has sufficiently changed since the subject area was dedicated to warrant vacation or closing. 
(2)  That the vacation or closing be in accord with an adopted plan for the neighborhood, if such a plan exists. 
(3)  That the location of utilities and the drainage pattern shall be a major consideration in the decision on the vacation or closing. 
(4)  In cases where existing utilities and improvements exist on or in the subject area, but all other factors point to vacation or closing, the subject area shall be closed or vacated with an easement providing that nothing be built within the former right-of-way. 
(Code 1973, § 9.38.020)  
Sec. 82-58. - Maintenance and improvement requirements. 
In conjunction with the vacation of any street, alley, way or land, the common council may have a letter attached to the order vacating or closing specifying maintenance or improvement standards to be met by abutting property owners as a condition and that in the event of a failure to comply with the conditions within a specified time, the order for vacation or closing may be rescinded by action of the common council. 
(Code 1973, § 9.38.030)  
Sec. 82-59. - Vacating or closing major or collector street. 
In no case shall an approved major or collector street be vacated or closed without sufficient provision being made for handling of the traffic in another manner. 
(Code 1973, § 9.38.040)  
Sec. 82-60. - Turnarounds. 
It is found that a turnaround may be provided within a 60-foot right-of-way by utilizing the entire right-of-way. The radius of this turnaround would be large enough to allow for turning of all cars and small trucks, but would be too small for turning of city maintenance vehicles without backing up. If such a turnaround is constructed, it is suggested that: 
(1)  No parking be allowed in the turnaround; and 
(2)  If a street is closed by request of the abutting property owners and a turnaround constructed, the assessment for construction of the turnaround shall be assessed against the benefitting property owners, not merely those upon whose land the turnaround would abut. The city should not incur any costs. 
(Code 1973, § 9.38.050)  
Sec. 82-61. - Block parties. 
The commissioner of public works is hereby authorized to issue permits for residential block parties to be held between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., upon presentation of a petition therefor signed by over 50 percent of the residents on the particular street for which the block party is planned. Such permit may authorize the closing of any street within the city for such block party, except for those streets which are part of any federal, state or county trunk highway system, or are arterial or collector streets. Delivery of proper barriers, barricades, lights and warning signs therefor shall be the responsibility of the commissioner of public works. Placement of such protective devices shall be performed by the person to whom the permit has been issued. The fee for a block party permit shall be paid upon application in an amount established from time to time by the common council.

The commissioner of public works may require the applicant's report be provided by a structural engineer or other expert approved by the commissioner of public works, if the commissioner of public works deems it to be necessary to have such an expert opinion in light of the circumstances of the application, for the protection of public health and safety, in which case the applicant shall provide such an opinion at the applicant's cost. 
The plan must show how the installation and maintenance of said above grade right-of-way use will not impact snow or grass removal from the terrace, sidewalk, or street, or conflict with the operation or maintenance of vehicular travel and existing utilities above or below ground. 
An alternative analysis shall be provided to show what options other than locating above grade in the right-of-way exists and the approximate costs of such alternatives. 
(2)  Application process. The commissioner of public works shall review said permit application and determine if all application materials have been submitted within ten days of receipt of the initial application. 
If the application materials are not complete, the commissioner of public works shall provide written notice to the person on the application that said application is incomplete. 
The applicant shall have up to 30 days from the date of initial application to provide a complete application or the application shall be deemed insufficient and denied. 
The city shall have 60 days to review and act on the permit for existing uses under subsection (2)(b) from the date that the commissioner of public works determines the application is complete and all fees paid. The city shall have 90 days to review and act on the permit for new uses under subsection (2)(c) from the date that the commissioner of public works determines the application is complete and all fees paid. 
(a)  Existing uses. The commissioner of public works shall determine whether to approve, deny, or conditionally grant above grade right-of-way permits for any new installation, use, encroachment, obstruction, or excavation proposed to be added to either a previously approved above grade use or one that was legally placed prior to January 23, 2019, unless the commissioner of public works concludes the new installation, use, encroachment, obstruction, or excavation may obstruct or incommode the public use in which case the application shall be subject to the procedures of subsection (2)(c). 
(b)  New uses. All above grade right-of-way permit applications other than those described pursuant to subsection (2)(b), shall be considered as follows. 
A review of a permit application shall be conducted as soon as reasonably possible after the commissioner of public works has deemed application materials complete. 
Notice shall be given by the commissioner of public works to all properties within 200 feet of the proposed installation. 
The permit application review shall be conducted, at minimum, by the director of city development and the commissioner of public works, or their designees. Such permit application review shall give consideration to the application, information received from the applicant, staff and expert reports, or other information as the director of city development and the commissioner of public works, or their designees, determines appropriate. Consider shall be given public safety, alternative options, any established aesthetic considerations, and the public good when considering an above grade right-of-way permit. The director of city development and the commissioner of public works, or their designees, may grant the permit, grant the permit with conditions, or deny the permit. 
(c)  Right-of-way restoration. The work to be done under the permit, and the repair and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit to the satisfaction of the commissioner of public works. In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed before the commencement of the work and must inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 36 months thereafter. 
The permittee shall perform repairs and restorations according to the standards and with the materials specified by the commissioner of public works. The commissioner of public works shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The commissioner of public works in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and considerations: 
The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions, or damage to the right-of-way. 
The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way. 
The character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way; the pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way. 
The remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation. 
Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way. 
The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place. 
Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited to, patching, replacement of the right-of-way base, restoration of landscaping, and milling and overlay of the entire area of the right-of-way affected by the work. During this 36-month period, it shall, upon notification from the commissioner of public works, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the commissioner of public works. Said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the commissioner of public works. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the commissioner of public works, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the commissioner of public works, the commissioner of public works, at his or her option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. 
(d)  Bond. Prior to commencing the work, any permittee performing work within the right-of-way shall post a financial guarantee in an amount approved by the commissioner of public works and in a form approved by the city attorney, provided that the limitations of Wis. Stats. § 66.0425(2) shall apply as applicable. If, 36 months after completion of the restoration of the right-of-way, the commissioner of public works determines that the right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the performance bond shall be released. 
(e)  Indemnification agreement. Before any person, entity, or utility commences work pursuant to this section, such person, entity or utility shall execute an agreement with the city to hold the city harmless, indemnify, and defend the city from and against any and all injury and damage of any kind caused or occurring as a result of such work. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the city attorney, and shall have continuing effect during the course of such work and for all time that the obstruction or facilities or installation remain within the right-of-way, and thereafter until such obstruction is removed and the site is fully restored to the satisfaction of the commissioner of public works. 
(f)  Reservation of rights. The city retains all rights in city rights-of-way. The grant of a right-of-way permit per this section does not constitute a waiver of any city rights and remedies regarding ongoing compliance obligations toward such installations. All persons, entities and utilities installing obstructions or encroachments or conducting excavation in city rights-of-way shall remove or relocate the obstruction, encroachment, or excavation upon ten-day notice, except as otherwise provided by law. 
(g)  Compensation. The city may require payment of compensation, in an amount determined by the common council, for the grant of any permit pursuant to this section, provided that compensation for more than applicable fees and cost recovery shall not be required of utilities that have the right to use the right-of-way by Wis. Stats. § 182.017(1r). The compensation required shall be fair and reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory and designed to recover direct and actual costs in connection with the installation, such as the cost for staff to review the siting application, costs associated with the use of the right-of-way, costs associated with maintaining the right-of-way itself or structures within the right-of-way to which the facilities are attached, and these standards apply both to initial fees and any recurring fees. 
(h)  Waiver of deadlines. Timeline deadlines in this process may be waived by written mutual agreement of the applicant and the city. 
(i)  Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the staff determination regarding a right-of-way permit application within ten days of the date of receipt of such determination. The appeal shall be to the city planning, heritage, and design commission. Any such appeal shall be presented to the director of city development, who shall arrange for the city planning, heritage, and design commission to consider the matter at its next regularly scheduled meeting, subject to open meetings notice requirements. 
(j)  Compliance with laws. Approval of a permit pursuant to this section does not waive the requirement to comply with all other applicable laws and ordinances. All applicable federal, state, and local codes, statutes, regulations, administrative rules, ordinances and other laws must be followed.

(a)  Special charges. Special charges for current services which shall include, without limitation because of enumeration, snow and ice removal, weed elimination, street sprinkling, oiling and tarring, subgrading and stoning, tree care and water mains, shall not be payable in installments. If not paid within the period fixed by the common council, such charges shall be deemed a delinquent charge and shall become a lien on the property against which it is levied, and shall automatically be extended on the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, and all procedures relating to the collection, and return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes, shall apply to such charge. Any such delinquent charges shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof and penalty of 0.5 percent per month or fraction thereof from the preceding February 1. If any such special charge is not paid when due, the whole remaining real estate tax and special charges shall become delinquent on February 1. 
(b)  Special assessments. Special assessments shall be due upon determination of the amount of such assessment and may be paid without interest up to and including the due date. Any balance remaining unpaid after the due date shall be collected with interest from and after the due date at the annual interest rate specified in subsection (3), below. All unpaid balances will be collected in the following manner: 
(1)  Any balance of less than $200.00 shall be entered on the first tax roll prepared after such assessment shall have been determined, as a special tax on the property upon which such assessment was levied, and thereafter this tax shall be treated in all respects as any other municipal tax. 
(2)  Whenever the unpaid balance of the following special assessments is in excess of $200.00, it may be paid in ten annual installments: 
a.  Portland cement concrete pavement. 
b.  Portland cement concrete combined curb and gutter. 
c.  Sewer and water services. 
d.  Sanitary sewer. 
e.  New sidewalk construction. 
f.  Sidewalk repair or replacement. 
g.  Bituminous concrete pavement. 
(3)  The annual interest rate for all unpaid special assessment balances failing under subsections (1) and (2), above, will be adjusted every five years (beginning in 2012), as follows: 
a.  First, the average bank prime loan interest rate percentage for the preceding ten-year period shall be calculated. Next, a 0.5 percent administrative charge shall be added to this rate. Finally, this total interest rate percentage shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 percent. 
For example, if the average bank prime loan interest rate percentage for 2002—2011 is 5.017%, then the 2012—2016 interest rate for all unpaid special assessment balances falling under subsections (1) and (2), above, are as follows: 
 
b.  No adjustment to the special assessment interest rate shall exceed the previous rate by more than + 2.0 percent. 
c.  The bank prime loan interest rate percentage will be calculated from the annual figures released by the Federal Reserve System available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm. 
(c)  Payment in installments. 
(1)  The first installment of any special assessment shall include a proportionate part of the principal of the special assessment determined by the number of installments, together with interest at the rate of eight percent per annum computed for a period of one year from the due date, and each subsequent installment shall include a like proportion of the principal and one year's interest on the unpaid balance of the assessment. 
(2)  The first installment shall be entered in the first tax roll prepared after such installments shall have been determined, as a special tax on the property upon which the special assessment was levied, and thereafter this tax shall be treated in all respects as any other municipal tax. One of the subsequent installments shall be entered in a like manner and with like effect in each of the annual tax rolls thereafter until all are levied. 
(3)  If any installment so entered in the tax roll shall not be paid with the other taxes when due, it shall be returned to the county as delinquent and collected by the county in the same manner as delinquent general taxes on real estate.

(d)  Charges to outlying communities. In the event the utility changes the charges to be applied to portions of the area of extraterritorial customers of the city which are within the sewer service area of the wastewater utility, the utility shall notify such outlying communities in writing of the proposed changes at least three months prior to the effective date of the change. The utility shall maintain sufficient work papers from which to determine the basis of the charges applied to such outlying communities and shall promptly furnish copies to any outlying community upon request. Each outlying community may examine the books and records maintained by the utility for the purposes of determining costs that are factored into the sewerage service charges applied to outlying communities for sewerage service. Charges applicable for service to outlying communities shall be invoiced quarterly. All invoices shall be paid within 30 days of the date of the invoice, and if not so paid, the account will be considered delinquent. Delinquent payments shall be subject to late charges. 
(e)  Endangerment of system; extraordinary costs imposed on the system. The sewerage service charges established by the utility may include additional charges imposed upon users or outlying communities if they introduce wastewater with flows, peak flows, or characteristics, which impose special costs upon the utility, or which endanger the ability of the utility to achieve its public purposes as set forth in section 98-3, or which endanger the ability of the utility to safely and efficiently serve its other customers, or which result from failing to operate and maintain tributary sewers to safeguard treatment capability and the environment within the meaning of section 98-113, or which are not consistent with the utility's facilities plans, amendments thereto, and any base flow and peak flow allocations utilized therein.

Sec. 98-63. - Industrial buildings—Remote metering. 
(a)  No retail water service to an industrial building first being served on or after April 1, 2002 or to any such building that is remodeled or rehabilitated so as to require changes to the water service on or after April 1, 2002 shall be initiated or maintained without installation, operation and maintenance of authorized automatic meter reading (AMR) equipment and a telephone line for the purpose of monitoring all water metering equipment for the building. 
(b)  Monitoring equipment required by this section or installed and maintained pursuant to this section shall monitor the incoming water and all meters for cooling water or other non-sewered water for crediting purposes. 
(c)  The utility shall not install a water meter for an industrial building covered by this section until the owner or other responsible party ("owner") complies with this section. If the owner fails to maintain the monitoring system and/or telephone line associated therewith, the utility may take appropriate action to terminate the water service. Sewer service credit in the form of a non-contact credit meter shall not be given by the utility unless the authorized AMR equipment and associated telephone line are installed and maintained for that purpose. 
(d)  An owner that has one or more credit meters installed in an industrial building on the effective date of this section shall not be eligible for credits unless the meter is modified by installation of the automated meter reading (AMR) module or a complete new AMR meter with module. No meter shall be installed that does not meet utility requirements and all meters shall read in cubic feet. Meters may be purchased from the utility. Non-contact credits and sewer credits shall not be given for an industrial building that does not connect credit meters to the utility's AMR system in accordance with this section. No other means of remote monitoring of water meters or credit meters will be allowed. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02)  
Sec. 98-64. - Replacement of privately owned lead service lines. 
(a)  There are water mains buried underneath the streets and public rights-of-way in the city. Properties receive water from a water main via two service lines. One service line runs from the water main to a stop valve located either in the grass parkway, sidewalk or driveway of a property. That service line is owned by the water utility and is referred to as the "utility's service line". Another service line extends from that stop valve to the water meter assembly in the basement of the home or other structure located on the property. That service line is owned by the private property owner and is referred to as the "private service line". 
(b)  At the time of adoption of this section, there are approximately 9,000 properties in the city where both the utility's service line and the private service line are made of lead. Additionally, there are properties in the city where the utility's service line is made of lead and the private service line is made of copper, cast iron or galvanized iron. Lead private service lines and iron private service lines that are connected to lead public service lines are collectively referred to herein as the "eligible private service lines". 
(c)  There are two types of public works projects normally performed by the Racine Water Utility (collectively the "public works projects") that include work performed on behalf of the water utility, as funds are available, to replace the utility's service lines that are made of lead in the city. One project involves the replacement of a water main under a street. In that type of project, in addition to replacing the water main, the water utility also removes the utility's service lines made of lead in the area of the project and replaces those lines with copper tubing or pipe ("copper pipe"). The other project type involves a road replacement where the condition of the water main is such that it does not need to be replaced. In that type of project, the water utility only replaces the Utility's Service Line made of lead with copper pipe. 
(d)  The private service lines are on private property. Accordingly, the replacement of private service lines are the responsibility of the private property owners and not the utility. The Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) does not recognize private service lines as the property or responsibility of the water utility in its rules and regulations and does not permit the water utility to apply the money it collects from its water service rates to pay for the replacement of any private service lines. 
(e)  It is expected that from time to time the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR"), United States Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") or United States Congress will make funds available to the water utility or the city ("outside funds") that are earmarked to fund the replacement of eligible private service lines with copper pipe. Any outside funds that are made available to the water utility may be required to be expended during the year in which the funds were made available. The city may also be allowed to utilize community development block grants (CDBG) funds for the funding of eligible private service lines. 
(f)  The USEPA and WDNR have indicated to the water utility that the removal of only a portion of a lead service line serving a property and replacement thereof with copper pipe may negatively impact a property owner's water quality and could increase the amount of lead in the homeowner's water for a period of time. Accordingly, the USEPA and WDNR had expressed a preference that partial lead service line replacement projects be minimized and whenever possible all lead service lines connected to a property be replaced to enhance the safety of the water that is delivered to the property. 
(g)  During each year that outside funds are made available to the water utility, the water utility shall make the determination to use those funds in the following order of priority until the funds are expended: 
(1)  Priority one projects: To fund the replacement of eligible private service lines in connection with public works projects (i.e., total lead service line replacements). If sufficient funds are not available to replace all eligible private service lines in a given funding cycle, the water works commission shall develop a priority list for use in determining the eligible private service lines that will be replaced. 
(2)  Priority two projects: If there are outside funds remaining after funding the priority one projects, then the outside funds may be used to fund the replacement of private service lines that are made of lead or iron, where: 
a.  A lead utility service line serving a property was previously replaced with a copper pipe, or 
b.  The water utility decides to replace a lead utility service line serving a property with copper pipe if the replacement is not part of the work included in a public works project. 
1.  This could involve replacement of a previous lead service where houses in the distribution system are being reconstructed to be viable dwellings once again. 
2.  This could also involve requests from residents that were previously sampled for lead and where high lead results above EPA standards are known to exist. 
If there are not enough outside funds to pay for all priority two projects in any given year, the water utility may choose to allocate the funds expended within the priority two classification to locations discussed in paragraph b. above or at schools, nursing homes, day care centers and other multi-resident properties if such properties and entities are willing recipients. Eligible private service lines that are leaking or in otherwise poor condition may be given higher priority than other priority two projects that are not leaking or are in otherwise fair condition. 
(h)  The outside funds cannot be used for the replacement of copper or plastic private service lines that are broken or leaking. 
(i)  All private service line replacements shall be performed by licensed contractors and conform to all applicable state and local codes, regulations and ordinances. 
(j)  Payments for replacement of private service lines may be made as rebates to private property owners or directly to contractors who replace the lines for private property owners. 
(k)  The water utility shall formulate and carry out a private lateral replacement program that conforms to this section. The above program shall be subject to approval by the water works commission and may be amended as circumstances warrant, provided that the program shall at all times comply with this section. 
(l)  The status of the material comprising each public and private service line will be recorded on the city geographic information system (GIS) as part of any replacement effort. Should a homeowner decline to participate, this will also be recorded.

Sec. 98-88. - Impact fee. 
(a)  Established. Except as otherwise provided, an impact fee is hereby established for each new service connection to the city water supply system and for each change of use or for the addition of a new use or for a new or expanded building on a lot or parcel already connected to the city water system at the time of application. The impact fee shall not apply to the Village of Elmwood Park, the Village of North Bay or the Town of Somers if they fail to enter into a retail water service agreement that is substantially similar to the agreement between the city and the Village of Mt. Pleasant and the city and the Village of Sturtevant. 
(b)  Amount. The impact fee is established at $3,143.00 per REC. The amount of the impact fee shall be adjusted annually as of February 1 of each year by the percentage change in the annual average (20-city prices) Construction Cost Index (as published by the Engineering News Record). 
a.  For all residential users of the water supply system, the table set forth in section 98-87 shall be used to determine the number of RECs per dwelling unit or building. 
b.  For all nonresidential users of the water supply system, the impact fee shall be calculated as follows: 
i.  The municipality shall obtain and, if extraterritorial, provide to the city reliable information from each applicant for a connection to the Racine water system, before approving the connection, relating to the specific proposed use(s) of the property, in terms of SIC codes, if applicable, and the maximum employee hours for a peak day of operations. 
ii.  Based on the information provided, the city shall calculate the number of RECs for that property/development using the method set forth in section 98-87 and shall be calculate and impose an impact fee in accordance with subsection (b). All REC calculations for an account shall be rounded up to the nearest whole REC. A minimum fee based upon one REC shall apply to all nonresidential connections. 
iii.  Since the impact fee determined under subsections i. and ii. above is based upon the estimated intended usage, the city shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for a 12-month period. At any time between the first and third anniversary dates of establishment of the nonresidential water service account, the city may review the account history to determine the highest actual recorded usage in a 12-month period. 
iv.  Based upon the information obtained under subsection ii, the city may recalculate the impact fee. If the recalculated charge exceeds that of the amount paid for the original charge, the additional amount shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made. 
c.  Such fees collected by the city shall be placed in a special fund which shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and the special fund and all interest earned thereon shall be used exclusively for the particular capital costs for which the fee was imposed. 
d.  Such fees shall be expended by the city for the aforesaid purpose within seven years of the date of payment, or such fee amount paid along with any interest that has accumulated shall be refunded by the city to the current owner(s) of the property with respect to which such fee was imposed. 
(Ord. No. 20-07, pt. 1, 12-4-07)  
Sec. 98-89. - Fee reduction. 
Any impact fee imposed under this section shall be reduced to compensate for capital costs otherwise imposed by the city, upon the land development subject to this section, for the same public facilities for which an impact fee has been imposed under this section, including by way of special assessments, special charges, land dedications, or any ordinance adopted thereunder or any other items of value. Impact fees imposed under this section shall also be reduced to compensate for moneys received from the federal or state government specifically to provide or pay for the public facilities for which the impact fees under this section are imposed. 
(Ord. No. 20-07, pt. 1, 12-4-07)  
Sec. 98-90. - Exemption from fees. 
(a)  The lawful new construction of a single-family dwelling structure upon a nondivisible parcel of land supporting or having supported a habitable single-family dwelling structure razed or to be razed within one year of the date of the issuance of a building permit for the new construction as part of the new construction project shall be exempt from the fees imposed under this chapter. Any new construction of a single-family dwelling structure upon a single parcel of land involving the demolition of a preexisting residential structure upon such single parcel of land, which project is similar to but not exactly as described above to be exempt, may be found to be exempt upon application to the common council and a finding by the common council that such project does not bear a rational relationship to the need for new, expanded or improved public facilities required to serve such development. Such application shall be made to the common council prior to the payment of any fees under this section. 
(b)  No impact fee shall be due from the Village of Mt. Pleasant with respect to the connection to the city water system of a lot or parcel within 12 months after the effective date of the 2004 intergovernmental retail water service agreement Between the City of Racine (through the city water utility) and the Village of Mt. Pleasant if such lot or parcel was developed with a principal building prior to such effective date, and if the water main to which such lot or parcel is connected was existent prior to such effective date and if the connection is made in compliance with the requirements of section 13 of such agreement. No impact fee shall be due from the city during the 12 months after the effective date of such agreement. 
(Ord. No. 20-07, pt. 1, 12-4-07)  
Sec. 98-91. - Administration and review. 
The revenue and expenditure totals for each impact fee will be included in the city's annual budget, and a summary of the revenue and expenditure totals for each impact fee must also be made available in the City's annual budget summary required under Wis. Stats. § 65.90(3)(a). 
(Ord. No. 20-07, pt. 1, 12-4-07)  
Sec. 98-92. - Appeal. 
Any developer upon whom an impact fee is imposed under this division shall have the right to contest the amount, collection or use of the impact fee to the common council, provided that the developer files a written notice of appeal in the city clerk's office within 15 days of the developer's filing of an application for a building permit upon which the impact fee is imposed. Such notice of appeal shall be entitled "notice of appeal of impact fee" and shall state the developer's name, address, telephone number, address (if available) and legal description of the land development upon which the impact fee is imposed, and a statement of the nature of and reasons for the appeal. The city clerk shall schedule the appeal for consideration by the common council at a regular meeting as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances and shall notify the developer of the time, date and place of such meeting, in writing, by regular mail, deposited in the mail no later than at least three days before the date of such meeting. Upon review of such appeal, the common council may adjust the amount, collection or use of the impact fee upon just and reasonable cause shown.

Subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter, the utility shall provide wastewater sewer service to parties to the agreement for the area which has been approved in the agreement, and for non-parties, for the sewer service area as of March 31, 2002. Any additions to that sewer service area shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of the agreement; provided, however, that the utility shall provide wastewater sewer service to any area outside the city that requires a sewer extension only upon the annexation or other transfer of such area to the city or upon the consummation of a satisfactory sewer service and revenue-sharing agreement between the city, the utility and the appropriate local governmental entity or entities having jurisdiction over such area; and further provided that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any sewer extension with respect to which a complete and satisfactory application for approval of plans and specifications had been filed with the utility on or before February 6, 2001 in accordance with sec. 98-114 below. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02)  
Sec. 98-113. - Interceptors; collection systems within outlying communities. 
(a)  Obligation to construct, maintain and pay for tributary sewers. Each of the outlying communities shall construct, maintain and pay the cost of current and future interceptors required to be located within their respective boundaries in order to provide wastewater service to the portions of such outlying communities that are within the service area of the wastewater utility. The outlying communities shall construct, maintain and pay the cost of current and future interceptors from the portions of such outlying communities that are within the sewer service area of the city wastewater utility to receiving points designated by the utility which may include the city wastewater treatment plant. Outlying communities connecting to the city wastewater utility facilities shall pay the actual costs caused by such connections. Outlying communities connecting to the wastewater utility facilities shall also pay all costs associated with the collection systems within their respective boundaries in order to provide sewerage service within their respective boundaries. 
(b)  Obligation to operate and maintain tributary sewers to safeguard treatment capability and the environment. Each of the outlying communities shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent storm water, surface drainage, and other forms of infiltration and inflow (I/I) from entering into the interceptor sewers or other portions of the outlying community's collection system. Such actions may include adopting local ordinances, conducting surveys, adopting conservation measures, installing equalization facilities, rehabilitating sewers, manholes or other portions of the collection system, or such other measures as are dictated by current good professional standards, the outlying community's general WPDES permit for its tributary collection system, or otherwise required by law or the agreement. Such actions shall be undertaken to safeguard the ability of the utility to provide wastewater treatment service in accordance with its policies and purposes set forth in section 98-3, as required by the utility's WPDES permit, or as otherwise may be required by law or by the agreement. 
(c)  Failure to maintain tributary sewers to safeguard the treatment capability and the environment. If an outlying community is in violation of its WPDES general permit for its tributary system, or has repeated bypasses or overflows, and such events relate to a portion of the utility's service area, the outlying community shall presumptively be in violation of this section. In the event an outlying community fails to maintain its tributary sewers as required in this section, the wastewater commission may refuse to grant any further approvals for system plans, system plan amendments or construction plans, or sewer extensions, pursuant to section 98-114, and may also impose such additional charges on the outlying community as are reasonably related to the failure to comply with this section, in accordance with the agreement for parties to the agreement. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02)  
Sec. 98-114. - Approval of sewer plans; construction of projects. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to the submission and approval of plans and specifications of all sewers (except internal private plumbing) and appurtenances within the service area of the utility, including but not limited to: 
(1)  Sanitary sewer extensions to serve land that is not served by sanitary sewers; 
(2)  All sanitary sewer mains, interceptors, lift stations, including any enlargements and any components thereof; 
(3)  Equalization or storage facilities; and 
(4)  Projects to repair or replace any of the foregoing, or to rehabilitate any such facilities for purposes of reducing infiltration or inflow. 
(b)  Construction of projects; approval required. No person shall commence, or cause to be commenced, construction of any project referred to in subsection (a), above, within the service area of the utility until the project and the plans and specifications for such sewer or other facility shall have been approved by the general manager pursuant to this section. Nothing in this subsection relieves a person from obtaining any other applicable local, state, or federal permits or approvals. 
(c)  System plan required. The construction of all projects that will store or convey wastewater that will eventually be introduced into the interceptors of the utility or will be received at the treatment plant, shall be consistent with a system plan filed with and approved by the utility. Each outlying community which conveys wastewater into the interceptors of the utility, or directly or indirectly to the utility's treatment plant shall prepare and file a system plan with the utility. The system plan shall identify all facilities in the outlying community's sewer system in a detail and manner consistent with current good professional standards. Each application for approval of a project under this section shall be accompanied by a proposed amendment to the outlying community's system plan. 
(d)  Submission of plans and specifications. All applications for approval under this section shall be accompanied by a written request for approval, signed by the appropriate representative of the outlying community in which the proposed project is to be located, and a set of plans and specifications prepared in accordance with current good professional practice and that are sufficiently detailed to enable the general manager to reasonably determine the anticipated flow and characteristics of wastewater that may be transmitted through the proposed facilities. All plans and specifications shall be submitted with six copies of the proposed project, and three copies of the proposed amendment to the system plan, and two copies of the design computations; provided, however, that design computations will not be required for eight-inch diameter sanitary sewers that are designed to carry a peak flow equal to or less than seven-tenths cubic feet per second. Where a project will convey wastewater from more than one outlying community, the outlying community submitting the project for approval shall include evidence of the review and approval of any other outlying communities whose wastewater will be conveyed by the project. 
(e)  Approval of system plans and construction plans tributary to the sewerage system of the wastewater utility of the city. 
(1)  The general manager is authorized to approve system plans and amendments to system plans, and construction plans (hereafter collectively "plans"), for areas tributary to the utility's sewerage system or treatment plant provided that: 
a.  The plans are consistent with the utility's ordinances, and statements of policy and purposes; 
b.  The plans are consistent with the agreement, the utility's facilities plans, amendments thereto, and any base flow and peak flow allocations utilized therein; 
c.  As to system plans or construction plans from areas outside the boundaries of the city, to the extent the plans would permit base or peak flows in excess of any allocations utilized in facilities plans or the agreement, the outlying community has reached a written agreement with the utility purchasing such additional capacity or otherwise reaching agreement on the capital costs associated with such exceedances of base or peak flows; 
d.  As to system plans or construction plans from areas outside the boundaries of the city, the outlying community to which such plans relate is in full compliance with section 98-113; 
e.  As to system plans or construction plans from areas outside the boundaries of the city, the outlying community to which such plans relate has paid all sewerage service charges invoiced by the utility in full in a timely manner; 
f.  As to construction plans for areas outside the boundaries of the city, the construction plans must be consistent with previously approved system plans or amendments thereto; 
g.  The plans are within the sewer service area approved by the utility or in the agreement; and 
h.  The general manager reasonably finds that the plans should not be denied for one or more of the reasons set forth in the following subsection (2). 
(2)  In the event the general manager believes a proposed system plan, amendment to system plan, or construction plan is inconsistent with the sound management of the wastewater utility, or may damage the system, injure employees, surcharge any part or all of the sewerage system or plant, interfere with the wastewater treatment process at the plant, prevent or impair compliance with the utility's WPDES permit, contribute materially to bypassing in the tributary system or the interceptors or collection system in the utility's sewerage system, prevent or impair compliance with pretreatment regulations, fail to meet any of the criteria in the preceding subsection (1), or otherwise be inconsistent with the policies and purposes of the utility as described in section 98-3, then the general manager may deny approval of the plans. In exercising judgment under this section, the general manager may rely on the assessments of utility staff, and may make reasonable assumptions about the projected usage of the proposed project(s) based on current good professional practice. 
(3)  In the event the general manager intends to deny approval of plans, the general manager will allow, within a stated reasonable period, the proponents of the specific plan to submit such material as may address the concerns of the general manager. The general manager shall review such material and make a determination as to whether the plan should be approved or rejected. This determination must be made within 20 days after receipt of the material requested by the general manager after initial review. The general manager then may approve the plan if the criteria in these ordinances are satisfactorily addressed. If the general manager believes the denial of the plan should be sustained, the matter shall be submitted, along with the general manager's recommendation, to the wastewater commission for its final determination. In exercising its discretion to approve or deny the plan, the commission shall apply the criteria from this chapter of the agreement that apply to the general manager's initial determination and recommendation. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02)  
Sec. 98-115. - Right of inspection and survey; action for injunctive relief for violation of restrictions on use of system. 
The utility shall have the right to inspect and survey the wastewater input of all users, including industrial and commercial users within those portions of the communities outside the city boundaries within the utility's sewer service area. If it is determined by the utility that any wastewater entering the sewer system is in apparent violation of an applicable ordinance, the utility will notify in writing the user, and/or the outlying community within which the user is located, of such condition and request that the apparent violation be abated within a period of five days after receipt of notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the violation involves the discharge of toxic or hazardous substances to the collection system of the utility or for treatment at the treatment plant, or the violation threatens compliance with the city's WPDES permit, the violation must be immediately abated. If the violation is not abated in a timely manner, the utility or the appropriate enforcement agency may take any and all lawful measures, including court action for injunctive relief, to accomplish compliance with the standards established under the ordinances applicable to the wastewater system. Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any individual to demand legally required warrants or permits, if any, prior to the inspection of his or her property. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02)  
Sec. 98-116. - Metering facilities for outlying communities. 
(a)  General requirement. The actual flow and strength characteristics (BOD, SS, P or other parameters established by the utility from time to time) of sewage from each outlying community that has a portion of its area within the utility's sewer service area shall be measured at metering and sampling stations at the point of entry into the interceptor sewers or treatment plant of the utility. Such metering and sampling stations shall be installed and maintained by the outlying community in such a way as to accurately measure the total flow and strength characteristics of wastewater collected within the outlying community and entering into the interceptor sewers or treatment plant of the utility. Meters in such stations shall be calibrated at least every six months in order to maintain their accuracy. The calibration shall be performed using techniques recommended by the manufacturer of the meter. The outlying community shall be responsible for establishing and initiating the service and calibration schedule. The data from these metering and sampling stations shall be utilized by the utility for purposes of determining those portions of sewerage service charges that are dependent upon the flow and strength levels of the wastewater discharged into the utility's system. 
(b)  Right of inspection and sampling. The utility shall be granted access from time to time in order to verify the accurate operation of the metering and sampling station through inspection and the taking of grab samples. The outlying community shall also permit the utility immediate access in cases where the utility has reason to believe that potentially toxic or hazardous substances are in the wastewater emanating from the outlying community in amounts that jeopardize the compliance of the utility with its WPDES permit, or which would introduce a new toxic or hazardous substance into the influent of the utility's treatment plant that is not presently specifically and expressly limited in the utility's WPDES permit. 
(c)  No person shall connect or allow to be connected a private interceptor main sewer to a public sewer in the sewer service area without the prior written approval of the wastewater commission. 
(d)  No person shall construct or operate a private interceptor main sewer or allow to be constructed or operated a private interceptor main sewer within the sewer service area without the prior written approval of the wastewater commission.

Sec. 98-148. - Credit meters. 
(a)  Water measurement. Measurement of water not discharged into the wastewater system shall be by a meter purchased, installed and maintained at the expense of the owner in a manner satisfactory to the wastewater utility. During any period in which such meter shall fail to register, or shall fail to register properly, the amount of discharge during such period may be estimated by the wastewater utility. In cases where it may be cost prohibitive or physically impossible to comply with the installation of required metering devices, the responsible party may petition the wastewater commission for an alternate means of measurement. The alternate means of measurement shall be based upon scientific fact, equipment manufacturer's proven test results and/or sound engineering and scientific laws and principles. The technical staff of the utility shall evaluate the proposed alternative method of measurement and report their findings to the commission for action on the request. 
(b)  Application. Billing for sanitary sewer service for City of Racine customers is based on the assumption that the amount of water purchased by a facility, as recorded by a Racine water utility incoming water meter(s), will discharge via the sanitary sewer. Due to evaporation, irrigation, cooling, production, or other uses, this is not always the case. To recognize this loss, the wastewater utility will allow industrial, commercial, public authority, or multi-residential (three units or more) facilities, located in the City of Racine only, an option to gain sewer bill credit for water volume not discharged to the sanitary sewer system. The credit option does not apply to residential customers. To receive credit: Water loss must be metered by a water meter(s) approved by the utility; an application form must be completed with required attachments and be submitted for approval to the wastewater utility; and all meter installation and inspection procedures must be complied. The credit meter(s) must be maintained by the applicant, and the utility reserves the right to inspect or require calibration/certification. Credit will be applied directly on the water/sewer bill.

(a)  Every user from where wastewater or groundwater is discharged to a public sewer, either directly or indirectly, shall be charged for the use of the interceptor sewers, lift stations, and wastewater treatment facilities. Charges for such use shall consist of a user charge for the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater; for the treatment and disposal of prohibited substances, or for sampling, measurement and analysis performed by the wastewater utility, or for the recovery from each industrial user of its share of the federal grant. User charges shall be based on the volume and waste components of the wastewater discharged by an owner into the wastewater system as hereinafter provided. 
The utility may require any industrial user to test at its expense and on a regular basis the quantity, composition and concentration of any wastewater or groundwater discharged into the wastewater system, and to report such test results to the utility within reasonable times. 
(b)  The volume of wastewater or groundwater discharged into the sewerage system during any period shall be determined either by: 
(1)  Measurement of such discharge during such period by a meter installed and maintained by the owner at its expense and in a manner satisfactory to the wastewater utility; or 
(2)  By measurement of the quantity of water generated by or delivered to the owner from all sources during such period, less the quantity of any such water which shall not be discharged into the wastewater system during such period, in accordance with section 98-148 credit meter usage. The quantity of water delivered to the owner by the utility shall be measured by the water utility's water meter.

(1)  Notify user. 
(2)  Develop effluent limits, if possible, for such user(s) to correct the interference with the POTW. 
(3)  Take immediate action if necessary to eliminate interference. 
(c)  National categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the categorical pretreatment standards, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this division. The general manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, part 403.12. Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet the definition of a new source as defined in 40 CFR, part 403.3(k). New sources shall install, have in operating condition, and start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet the applicable pretreatment standards before beginning discharge. Within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed 90 days, new sources shall be required to meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR, chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated: 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the general manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c); 
(2)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharge per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(3)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharge per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(4)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the general manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e); 
(5)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard; and 
(6)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(d)  Local limits. The general manager is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). The following limits are established to protect against pass-through and interference. No user shall discharge wastewater containing the following pollutants in excess of the following. These local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged from the industrial user facility to the POTW collection system.

1  Aggregate concentration of any volatile compound, acid extractable compound, or base/neutral compound identified pursuant to Clean Water Act Section 307(a) or NR 215.03(1), (2), and (3). Pesticides, PCBs, dioxin, heavy metals, and other compounds in the identified list are excluded. Pesticides, PCBs, and dioxin discharges are not allowed. 
All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. 
(2)  Grab sample only: 
a.  Any wastewater containing fats, wax, grease or oils whether emulsified or not, in excess of 200 mg/l as measured by an approved EPA method or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius and 65.6 degrees Celsius).* 
b.  1.9 mg/l total cyanide. 
c.  5.17 mg/l BETX (aggregate of benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene, xylenes) gasoline derivatives. 
(3)  Additional monitoring requirements: All dischargers may be required to monitor for the following pollutants: 
a.  Arsenic, selenium, silver, molybdenum, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, chloride, hexavalent-chromium, phenol, pesticides, dioxin, PCBs. 
b.  The general manager may impose mass limits in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limits above. 
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in the wastewater the general manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits. 
When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the general manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the general manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
When developing equivalent mass limits, the general manager: 
1.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 98-151(g). The industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 98-151(j) regarding the prohibition of bypass.] 
4.  The general manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the general manager. 
[Note: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the general manager will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by subsection 98-151(g) of this division (see 40 CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the general manager will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)).] 
5.  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)] 
Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8)] 
6.  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the general manager within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the general manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)] 
c.  The general manager may impose additional limits and/or monitoring requirements on pollutants of concern. 
d.  The general manager may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and general discharge prohibitions. Control mechanisms (permits) shall contain effluent limits, including best management practices, based on prohibited discharge standards, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and state and local law. 
The general manager shall be able to modify these limitations as long as they do not violate state or federal laws. 
*Any variance requests for fats, wax, grease or oils limitations as set forth in subsection 98-151(d)(2) shall be submitted to the general manager. The variance request shall be based upon the criteria enumerated in 40 CFR, part II, sec. 403.13. If a variance is granted, the general manager will have sole discretion on whether to accept alternative testing procedures for the variance. 
(e)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this division. 
(f)  Utility's right of revision. The utility reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations of requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in subsection 98-150(a) of this division. 
(g)  Excessive discharge (dilution). No user shall ever increase the use of process water or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the categorical pretreatment standards or this division. The general manager may impose mass limitations on users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(h)  Accidental discharges. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's own expense. 
(i)  Sludges generated. Sludges, floatables, skimmings, etc., generated by an industrial or commercial pretreatment system shall not be placed into the Racine POTW. Such sludges shall be contained, transported, and disposed of by haulers in accordance with all federal, state and local regulations. 
(j)  Bypass of treatment facilities. Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of the user's treatment facility. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited unless it is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage or there are no feasible alternatives; and 
(2)  The permittee may allow bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation; 
(3)  Notification of bypass: 
a.  Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance of the need for bypass, it shall submit prior written notice, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, to the wastewater utility. 
b.  Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit oral notice within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass to the wastewater utility and submit a written notice to the utility within five days. This report shall specify: 
1.  A description of the bypass and its cause, including its duration, including exact dates and times; 
2.  Whether the bypass has been corrected, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and 
3.  The steps being taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent a reoccurrence of the bypass. 
4.  The general manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(k)  Continuation of expired permits. An expired permit will continue to be effective and enforceable until the permit is reissued if: 
(1)  The permittee has submitted a complete permit application at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the user's existing permit; and 
(2)  The failure to reissue the permit, prior to the expiration of the previous permit, is not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the permittee. 
(l)  Records retention. An industrial user subject to this division shall retain and preserve for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling, and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of an industrial user in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of any enforcement or litigation activities brought by the city pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the industrial user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(m)  Accidental discharge/slug (spill) control plans. The general manager shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug discharges. For industrial users identified as significant prior to March 3, 2014, this evaluation shall have been conducted by February 1, 2015. Additional significant industrial users shall be evaluated within one year of being designated as significant industrial users. The general manager may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement the slug discharge control plan approved by the city on (date). Alternatively, the general manager may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the general manager of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by this division; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(5)  The slug discharge control plan must use the following approved format:

This information is useful in determining the origin of a slug or spill, potential hazards and appropriate response procedures. A chart format works well: 
Chemical 	Location 	Volume present in facility 	Type of container 	Transfer areas and practices 	Remarks 
					
 
1)  Materials - Both chemical and trade names should be listed (OSHA SDSs may be used). 
2)  Location - This will assist personnel in locating areas affected by a spill. 
3)  Container Volume - Useful in determining the potential impact of a slug/spill. 
4)  Container Description - The type of container (e.g. steel drum, fiberglass tank, etc.) and the presence of any valves, pumps, transfer pipes, etc. 
5)  Transfer/Transport Areas - To assess spill potential, possible effects on the treatment plant. 
6)  Additional Remarks - Information on the physical, chemical, and toxicological effects of each material, and special precautions to prevent contact between incompatible materials. 
B.  Each facility must demonstrate that the following aspects have been considered: 
1)  construction of the container; 
2)  other materials in the immediate vicinity; and 
3)  surrounding environment 
SECTION 3: SPILL REPORTING 
A.  Reporting and documenting spills and slug discharges should be described. 
1)  Time, date, and cause of the incident; 
2)  Impact of the spill on the treatment plant and the environment; 
3)  Extent of injury and/or damage; and 
4)  How future incidents can be avoided.

SECTION 4: SPILL AND LEAK PREVENTION 
This subsection is divided into a discussion of equipment and procedures. Information that a Slug Control Plan could contain are listed here. 
A.  Existing and Proposed Spill Prevention and Containment Equipment 
1)  This section should identify all existing equipment and systems that are in place. 
2)  If equipment needs to be purchased, the expected purchase dates should be provided. 
B.  Equipment to Prevent or Detect Spills 
1)  Chemical storage, process tanks, holding tanks, use compatible materials in construction; underground seepage protection; cathodic protection; level sensing devices; overflow, temperature, pressure alarms; heating coils; collision protection; secondary containment; diversionary structures. 
2)  Drums: drum construction; storage areas; secondary containment; diversionary structures; collision protection; drum handling equipment; drip pans 
3)  Pipes, Valves, Fittings, Pumps, Electrical and Mechanical Equipment: seals; valve stem packing; gaskets; cathodic protection; vehicular traffic warning signs

C.  Equipment to Contain Spills 
1)  Booms, barriers, sweeps, and fenders; surface collecting agents; absorbent materials; skimmers, oil/water separators; sumps; sewer plugs. 
2)  Address secondary containment system. A facility which has spill potential should provide secondary containment systems wherever possible. 
a)  Diking is the most effective secondary containment for bulk chemical storage. Dikes can be constructed from concrete, cinder blocks, or earth. They should contain 110% of the largest tank capacity, or water from a maximum 24 hour/ten year rainfall event, whichever is greater. Design of the dike should include the containment of a spraying leak from the side of the tank or baffles could be installed on top of the dike to deflect spray and cause it to drop into the containment area. 
b)  Diversion of flow of spilled material away from its naturally expected path can also be an effective means of secondary containment. Diversionary structures consist of curbs, sumps or gutters which divert spilled material to the collection tank. 
D.  Procedures 
1)  Many operation and maintenance procedures are common-sense and should be included in the Plan. Good housekeeping includes chemical storage and prompt spill cleanup to prevent reaching the sewage system. Preventive maintenance includes periodic inspections and equipment testing, adjustment, repair, or parts replacement. A security system to prevent facility site entry would reduce the risk of illegal activities that could cause a slug or spill. 
2)  Examples of operating and maintenance procedures are listed below: 
a)  Inspect chemical storage vessels, and process vessels and fittings (pumps, valves, piping): Appropriate materials of construction are to be used that are compatible with chemicals being processed. Inspections and monitoring frequencies should be listed. 
b)  Inspect foundations and supports of large tanks, vessels, and piping: 
c)  Above-ground vessels should be protected with truck guards. Underground vessels and pipes should be protected from physical and corrosion damage. 
d)  Liquid level control devices placed on open tanks, use grounding apparatus (where necessary): Overflow, 
temperature and pressure alarms should be installed. 
e)  Use proper drum handling equipment: No scooping drums with forks of a fork truck. Use pallets. Oil dispensing racks should be provided with drip pans. 
f)  Secure loading/unloading pump station controls: Warning signs or crossing gates should be used to prevent trucks from driving away while the loading hose is connected. 
g)  Eliminate all unnecessary cross connections: Unnecessary floor drains should be plugged, especially in high-risk areas. 
h)  Utilize automatic storm water and/or sewer sampling systems to monitor for spills: Systems can have automatic shut-off devices to prohibit discharge. 
SECTION 5: EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES 
Information in this section of the Plan includes an inventory of available emergency response equipment and a description of emergency response procedures. 
A.  Equipment 
1)  Communication equipment and alarms: Phone, intercom, radio, alarm, etc. 
2)  Spill containment and control equipment and tools: Absorbent materials and dry chemicals. 
3)  Spilled material storage containers: Spills must be contained and removed as soon as possible to prevent spreading into other areas. 
4)  Protective clothing and respirators (if needed): 
- flameproof protective clothing 
- rubber gloves 
- apron 
- goggles/face mask 
- hard hat 
- self-contained breathing apparatus 
5)  First aid kits: Immediately available for use if necessary. State the location of first aid kits. 
6)  Ventilation equipment: Tests should be made for explosive atmosphere, toxic gases and oxygen deficiency. Ventilate area if needed. 
7)  Decontamination equipment: Appropriate protective clothing and monitoring equipment should be used for radioactive material. 
8)  Fire extinguishing systems: Locations should be posted throughout the plant. 
B.  Procedures 
Spill plans should contain a spill response description. Procedures should minimize danger to human health and to assist in containment and cleanup of a spill. 
1)  Notification of proper facility personnel: The proper qualified person should respond to a spill. This person(s) should be familiar with the Plan and have the authority to initiate emergency response procedures. Signs indicating this contact and their phone number should be posted. 
2)  Evacuation procedures: An evacuation plan should be posted. The plan should contain: (1) a map of evacuation routes, (2) a map of alternative evacuation routes, and (3) a description of signals used to begin and conduct an evacuation. 
3)  Notification of response agencies and contractors: A list of spill response agencies and phone numbers should be posted. In the event of a spill, the appropriate response agency should be notified immediately. 
4)  Spill assessment and response procedures: Those designated to carry out spill response procedures should assess the spill. The origin of the spill and the impact should be assed. Spill response procedures that should be included in the plan: 
a)  Notification of facility personnel by activating the communication and/or alarm system 
b)  Begin evacuation procedures if necessary 
c)  Notification of appropriate local, state, and federal agencies 
d)  Stop the flow by shutting off pumps or closing valves 
e)  Prevent contact between incompatible materials 
f)  Commence clean-up activities 
g)  Submit necessary reports 
5)  Procedures for clean-up, treatment, and/or disposal of spilled materials: Spilled material should be treated or disposed of to eliminate health and safety hazards. Information pertaining to treatment and disposal methods used by the facility should be included in the Plan. If outside contractors and/or consultants are utilized in clean-up, treatment, or disposal, the plan should include the company name, contact person and phone number. 
These procedures should be consistent with the ones established in the facility's OSHA Emergency Action Plan, as required by 29 CFR § 1910.38 
SECTION 6: DAMAGE CONTROL 
Information in this section of the plan should describe how the facility plan will limit damage to the environment and the wastewater treatment plant. 
SECTION 7: TRAINING PROGRAM 
A.  The Plan should contain an outline of the training program given to employees. Specialized training should also be provided to each employee or group of employees that handle potentially dangerous chemicals. 
B.  Periodic training sessions should be conducted to assure understanding of the Plan. 
New employees should be trained immediately upon employment. 
1)  Employees should also be notified and retrained with any Plan changes. 
2)  Training records should be maintained and kept three years from the date the employee last worked at the facility. 
3)  Periodic drills should be set up. The purpose and frequency of drills should be indicated in the Plan. 
SECTION 8: CERTIFICATION 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the slug/spill control measures in the slug/spill plan, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this facility is implementing the slug control plan submitted to the Racine Wastewater Utility. 
(n)  Hauled wastewater. 
(1)  Septic tank and holding tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the general manager, and at such times as are established by the general manager. Such waste shall not violate categorical standards, or prohibitions, or local limits outlined in section 98-151 of this division or any other requirements established by the utility. The general manager may require waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits; 
(2)  The general manager shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The general manager may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The general manager also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this division; 
(3)  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the general manager. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the general manager. The general manager may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The general manager may require the industrial waste hauler to provide waste analysis of any load prior to discharge; and 
(4)  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form, as approved by the utility, shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(o)  Groundwater discharge. Discharge of polluted water to the sanitary sewer system from construction or remediation projects may require a groundwater discharge permit. 
(1)  Contaminated groundwater may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the general manager, and at such times as are established by the general manager. Such waste shall not violate section 98-151 of this division or any other requirements established by the utility. The utility may regulate the allowable rate of discharge, or order the discharge ceased, if deemed necessary. A flow meter will be installed to measure flow in accordance with subsection 98-149(b), with a sampling valve for obtaining samples for analysis; 
(2)  If the general manager requires a discharger to obtain a groundwater discharge permit, the general manager shall require the generator or contractor in charge of the site to submit a groundwater discharge application; 
(3)  The general manager shall require analysis of permitted groundwater discharge to ensure compliance with applicable standards in accordance with section 98-132 and subsection 98-149(a). The applicant shall provide the utility with any previous laboratory analysis. The general manager may require the generator to provide analysis of any load prior to commencement of discharge, or of any groundwater being discharged. Discharge shall be denied if the established limits will be exceeded; 
(4)  Discharge will at all times be in compliance with the listed limits in section 98-151; 
(5)  Generators must provide the required information requested on the groundwater discharge application form provided by the utility.

Sec. 98-152. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(a)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 98-151 of this division within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the general manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the WDNR and general manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the WDNR and general manager before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the utility under the provisions of this division. No person shall do such work that is within the purview of the city building, plumbing or electrical code without first obtaining required permits. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the general manager may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division; 
(2)  The general manager may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization; 
(3)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the general manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the general manager and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, in accordance with the utility's fats, oils and grease management plan and best management practices, (section 98-158), by the user at its expense; and 
(4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02; Ord. No. 13-14, pts. 58, 59, 1-20-15)  
Sec. 98-153. - Administration. 
(a)  Wastewater discharge permits. 
(1)  Individual wastewater discharge permits. All significant users are required by this section to obtain a wastewater discharge permit. All new users proposing to connect to or to contribute to the POTW shall be surveyed to determine their need to obtain a wastewater discharge permit before connecting to or contributing to the POTW. All significant users that have facilities in more than one geographic location will be issued separate wastewater discharge permits for each facility. An individual wastewater discharge permit shall include such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by the general manager to prevent pass-through or interference, protect the quality of the receiving water, protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW. All permits must contain: 
a.  A statement that indicates the wastewater discharge permit issuance date, expiration date and effective date; 
b.  A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is issued to a specific industrial user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new significant user. 
c.  Effluent limits, including best management practices, based on applicable pretreatment standards and local limits; 
d.  Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record-keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of pollutants (or best management practice) to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on federal, state, and local law. 
e.  A new wastewater discharge applicant or industry user applying for permit renewal shall sample for suspected TTO compounds. Any toxic organic compound found in the user's discharge at a concentration greater than 0.01 mg/l will be summed for a determination of compliance with the TTO limit specified in subsection 98-151(d). If an individual identified TTO is below 0.01 mg/l, no sampling for that TTO compound will be required for the duration of the permit, unless user discharge characteristics change. 
f.  A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by applicable federal, state, or local law. 
g.  Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the general manager to be necessary. 
(2)  Other permits. The general manager may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purpose of this division. Industries that do not discharge process waste, or discharge minimal amounts of wastewater, but are still considered by the general manager to have the potential to impact the POTW, may be issued a minimal or no-discharge permit. This permit is approved only after the general manager has inspected the facility. A slug discharge plan must be on file with the utility. The facility will be inspected annually to confirm the no discharge status of the facility. Groundwater discharge permits may be required in accordance with subsection 98-151(o). 
a.  Excepting that upon finding that a user meeting the criteria of a significant user has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the general manager may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from a user, and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial user. Such user shall be classified as a non-significant industrial user. 
(3)  Violations. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this division. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of state, federal, and local law. 
(4)  Application. Users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file with the utility an application in the form prescribed by the utility, and accompanied by a permit fee as specified in section 98-154 of this division.

For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 98-153(a)(7). 
(4)  Periodic compliance reports (self-monitoring reports). 
a.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the general manager but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the general manager or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 98-153(a)(7) of this division. 
b.  A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the general manager must annually submit a certification statement signed in accordance with the non-significant categorical industrial user signatory requirements in subsection 98-153(a)(7). The certification statement must accompany an alternative report required by the general manager. 
c.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
d.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the general manager, using the procedures prescribed in subsections 98-153(b)(9) and (10) of this division, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. Both categorical and non-categorical industrial users shall report all monitoring results. 
e.  All users subject to categorical pretreatment standards that have waste shipped off-site for disposal shall submit a report semi-annually (in June and December) listing the category, manufacturing process, volume and destination of such wastes. 
(5)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the general manager of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 20 days before the change.

b.  The general manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
c.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(6)  Reports of potential problems. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, such as any slug loading in violation of NR 211.10(2) and subsection 98-151(a) or (b) of this Code, or of any changes at the industrial users' facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge and the need for a slug control plan as required by NR 211.235(4)(a) and subsection 98-151(m) of this Code, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the general manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent location advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notifications procedure. 
a.  Slug or accidental discharges. Industrial users shall notify the utility immediately upon having a slug or accidental discharge of substances or wastewater in violation of this division in order to enable countermeasures to be taken by the utility to minimize damage to the POTW and the receiving waters. The notification shall include damage to the POTW and the receiving waters, location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. The utility may choose to immediately take action pursuant to section 98-155, enforcement. 
Within five days following an accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the general manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability that may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. After receipt and review of the written report, the utility may choose to take no further action or to take action in accordance with section 98-155. 
b.  Operating upsets report. For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. Any categorical industrial user which experiences a temporary state of noncompliance with this section or a wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto shall inform the utility thereof within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. The utility may choose to immediately take action pursuant to section 98-155. Where such information is given orally, the user shall file a written follow-up report with the utility within five days. The report shall specify: 
1.  Description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact on a user's compliance status. 
2.  Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur. 
3.  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance. 
A documented and verified bona fide operating upset shall be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the utility against a user for any noncompliance with the section or any wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto, which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability that may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. After receipt and review of the written report, the utility may choose to take no further action or to take action in accordance with section 98-155. 
(7)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the general manager as the general manager may require. 
(8)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user must notify the general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the general manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the POTW samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling, or if the POTW has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
(9)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. Where an industrial user requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the POTW or the applicable standard to determine compliance. 
(10)  Sample collection. Sampling and analysis shall be performed by all significant industrial users (categorical and non-categorical) to identify the concentration or mass of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process, according to the requirements of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the utility. Both daily maximum and average values shall be reported. 
Except as indicated, the user shall collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the general manager may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Sampling requirements are documented in each individual industrial discharge permit. 
In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using grab collection techniques. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grabs samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or the field. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the utility, as appropriate. 
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the general manager may authorize a lower minimum of one grab sample of each parameter where grab samples are required. 
For the periodic reports required by the industrial user discharge permit, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary (as indicated by discharge permit) to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(11)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(12)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under subsection 98-151(d)(3). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used, and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or general manager, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the general manager. 
(13)  Limitations imposed on significant users. The general manager may impose mass limitations on significant users which are using dilution to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by categorical pretreatment standards in the effluent of the significant user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the general manager, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standards. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established in the latest approved version of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, and as amended, and/or established by the administrator pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. (Comment: Where 40 CFR, part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication "Sampling and Analysis Procedure for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977," and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator). 
(14)  Batch discharge report. The user shall notify the utility five days prior to discharging the contents of any tank of batch discharge. Included in this report shall be the volume of all batch discharges recorded for each discharge event and batch tank volumes. The general manager may require that batch discharges or tank contents to be discharged must be analyzed by procedures outlined under the self-monitoring reports subsection 98-153(b)(10), and must be found to be in compliance with all discharge limits that are in effect before discharge may occur. Grab samples must be taken for batch discharges. The grab samples must be representative of the monitored discharge or total tank contents and shall be taken prior to batch discharging. The contents of the tank are to be mixed uniformly or subsamples of the top, middle and bottom of the tank shall be taken and composited. 
(15)  Notification of hazardous wastes in discharge. An industry which discharges any amount of acute hazardous waste according to § NR 661.30 (4) or 661.33 (5); or more than 15 kilograms per calendar month of any substance that would be hazardous waste according to ch. NR 661 if otherwise disposed, to the sanitary sewer shall notify the POTW, the WDNR's Bureau of Solid Waste and the EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (batch, continuous or other); and submit a certification that the industrial user has a program in place to reduce to the extent economically practicable the volume and toxicity of the generated hazardous wastes. If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section needs to be submitted only once except for notification of changed discharge in subsection 98-153(b)(5). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under self-monitoring requirements. In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the general manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(c)  Monitoring facilities and compliance monitoring. 
(1)  Pretreatment. Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level approved by the utility shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the utility and WDNR for review, and shall be approved by the utility and WDNR before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent approved by the utility under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be submitted to and be approved by the utility and WDNR prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. 
(2)  Monitoring facilities. The industrial user is required to provide and operate at its own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should be situated on the industrial user's premises, but, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the industrial user, the facility may be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles and comply with Wis. Stats. § 66.0425. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether conducted on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the utility's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the utility, unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the utility. 
(3)  Inspection and sampling. The utility shall inspect the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants or premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the utility or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, or in the performance of any of their duties. The utility, DNR, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations; as well as facility and documentation inspection to assess compliance with best management practices, including, but not limited to, mercury reduction, kitchen FOG management, and vehicle service fluid and vehicle wash management. Where an industrial or commercial user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the industrial or commercial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the utility, DNR, and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
a.  The general manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
b.  The general manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
c.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall promptly be removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the general manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born[e] by the user. 
d.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the general manager access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
e.  Monitoring points may change only after receiving written approval from the general manager. 
(4)  Special inspection warrants. If the general manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the general manager may seek issuance of a special inspection warrant from an appropriate court. 
(d)  Confidential information. Information and data concerning a user which may be obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the general manager's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the general manager, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the WPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

Sec. 98-154. - Fees. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of necessary costs from the users of the utility's POTW for the implementation of the program established herein. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the utility's schedule of charges and fees, to be prepared from time to time, by the general manager and approved by the wastewater commission. 
(b)  Charges and fees. The utility may adopt charges and fees that may include: 
(1)  Permit fee. The utility will charge an annual permit fee. Permit fees include the costs of processing applications, slug discharge plans, solvent management plans, inspections, reviewing monitoring reports and certification statements, responding to non-compliance issues and preparing semi-annual and annual reports to the WDNR. Permit fees are calculated and based upon categorical status, flow and compliance of a permitted user. 
(2)  Sampling charge. The utility will assess a sampling charge for sampling a user's wastewater with utility equipment and manpower. 
(3)  Laboratory analysis charge. The utility will assess a laboratory analysis charge to recover the utility's expenses to have the industrial wastewater samples analyzed for specific pollutants under categorical pretreatment standards or where specifically regulated by the utility. 
(c)  Additional charges. Additional costs will be charged to industrial users on a case by case basis for the following items: 
(1)  Fees for filing appeals; 
(2)  Fees for consistent removal (by the utility) of pollutants otherwise subject to categorical pretreatment standards where this is an additional cost to the utility; and 
(3)  Other fees as the utility may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein where there is an additional cost to the utility. 
These fees relate solely to matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the utility. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02; Ord. No. 13-14, pt. 97, 1-20-15)  
Sec. 98-155. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Notice of noncompliance. Whenever the utility finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained here, including required best management practices, the utility shall issue the permittee a "notice of noncompliance" for violations, except where serious noncompliance justifies immediate issuance of a notice of violation. The notice of noncompliance will explain the nature of the noncompliance and require that the permittee, within 45 days of the date of notice, file a plan for the correction of the noncompliance. The plan shall be reviewed by the utility and approved if the plan demonstrates that the proposed action will eliminate the violation. If the industrial user does not comply with an approved plan, the utility may take action in accordance with section 98-155. 
(b)  Notice of violation. Whenever the utility finds that any industrial user has violated, continues to violate, or is violating this division, wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein, including required best management practices, the utility may serve upon such user a written notice of violation stating the nature of the violation. Within 45 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the utility by the industrial user. If the plan is satisfactory to the utility and the industrial user complies with the plan, the utility may not take further action against the industrial user. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after the receipt of the "notice of violation." Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the general manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. 
(1)  Notice of hearing. The utility may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the board of standards why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the board of standards regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the board of standards why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. The notice of the hearing may be served on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(2)  Hearing officials. The board of standards may itself conduct the hearing and take evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the utility to: 
a.  Issue in the name of the board of standards notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
b.  Take evidence; 
c.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the board of standards for action thereon. 
(3)  Transcripts. At any hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(d)  Issuance of orders. After the board of standards has reviewed the evidence, it shall make a recommendation to the utility. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued by the utility, including, but not limited to, a compliance order, a consent order, a cease and desist order, or other action as deemed necessary and appropriate. If the user violates an order or directive, the utility may take action in accordance with section 98-155. 
The remedies provided for in this ordinance are not exclusive. The general manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the utility's enforcement response plan. However, the general manager may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the general manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(1)  Consent orders. The general manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(2)  Compliance orders. When the general manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the general manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(3)  Cease and desist orders. When the general manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the general manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Publication of user in significant noncompliance. The general manager shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice in the area serviced by the utility, a list of users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance means: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount, including an instantaneous limit; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit, including an instantaneous limit, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH; or exceed a pH limit by 0.4 standard units.); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the general manager believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public because of a violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the general manager's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit, compliance schedule or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) that the general manager determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program, including violation of best management practices. 
(f)  Emergency suspensions. The general manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The general manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any industrial user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utility shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The utility may reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the general manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(g)  Termination of discharge. Any user which violates the following conditions is subject to termination of discharge privileges: 
(1)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the general manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(h)  Legal action. If any industrial user discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the utility's POTW contrary to the provisions of this division, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the utility, the utility may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate court. The utility may take further action pursuant to section 98-155 and/or section 98-156. 
(i)  Criminal prosecution. The department of natural resources may seek civil and criminal penalties and injunctive relief from an industrial user or POTW, as necessary, if the WDNR deems that the POTW enforcement actions are insufficient per NR 211.32(2). 
(j)  Revocation of wastewater discharge permit. Any industrial user which violates the following conditions of this division, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having its individual wastewater discharge permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of section 98-155. The general manager may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to notify the general manager of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
(2)  Failure to provide prior notification to the general manager of changed conditions pursuant to subsection 98-153(b)(5) of this division; 
(3)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(4)  Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements; 
(5)  Is found tampering or to have tampered with sampling or flow measurement equipment, samples, and/or analyses being conducted by or at the direction of the utility; 
(6)  Refusing to allow the general manager timely access to the facility premises and records; 
(7)  Failure to meet effluent limitations; 
(8)  Failure to pay fines; 
(9)  Failure to pay sewer charges; 
(10)  Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
(11)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(12)  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; 
(13)  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this division; 
(14)  Failure of an industrial user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(15)  Failure of the industrial user to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
The utility may also revoke the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such revocation is necessary, in the opinion of the utility, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the utility to violate any condition of its WPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02; Ord. No. 13-14, pts. 98—109, 1-20-15)  
Sec. 98-156. - Penalty; costs and actions. 
(a)  Civil penalties. An industrial user which is found to have violated an order of the board of standards or which willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this division or any orders, rules, regulations or permits issued hereunder, shall forfeit civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000.00 per day for each violation, plus costs for each offense. Each permit limit violation shall be considered a separate and distinct violation. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. [NR 211.22(8)] 
(b)  Costs of damage. An industrial user violating any division of this chapter or which has a discharge that causes a deposit, obstruction, damage or other impairment to the city POTW shall become liable to the utility for any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violation or discharge. The utility may add to the industrial user's charges and fees the costs assessed for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this division. 
(c)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification on any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or wastewater discharge permit, or falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a forfeiture of not more than $1,000.00 per occurrence, plus court costs. 
(d)  Penalty escalation. Unpaid charges shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance. Additional penalties, up to and including termination of sewer service, shall apply for continued unpaid fees or charges, or continued pretreatment program noncompliance, in accordance with the utility enforcement response plan, as approved by the wastewater commission. 
(Ord. No. 7-02, pt. 1, 4-15-02; Ord. No. 13-14, pts. 110—112, 1-20-15)  
Sec. 98-157. - Amalgam management at dental offices. 
(a)  This section applies to any dental office that places or removes amalgam. Dental offices that do not place or remove dental amalgam except in limited emergency or unplanned, unanticipated circumstances need only to submit the one-time compliance form by the dates listed in subsection (c) and (d). If work in a dental office is limited to work that does not involve placing or removing amalgam, such as oral pathology, orthodontics, periodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery/radiology, endodontics, or prosthodontics, then this section does not apply. 
(b)  All dental offices shall implement the following basic requirements for amalgam management as established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Dental Office Point Source Category 40 CFR Part 441, WDNR Mercury Minimization Program, and the Racine Wastewater Utility Dental Program. 
(1)  Operate and maintain an amalgam separator that meets the criteria of 40 CFR 441.30, 441.40, and the International Standards Organization (ISO 11143) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amalgam separator shall have a design and capacity appropriate for the size and type of vacuum system. 
(2)  Do not discharge any amalgam waste to the POTW. Waste must be collected in the separator and a separate amalgam waste bucket which will be hauled offsite as dental amalgam waste. 
(3)  Lines must not be cleaned with oxidizing or acidic cleaners including but not limited to bleach, chlorine, iodine, and peroxide. Cleaners must have a pH between 6-8. 
(4)  Adhere to all reporting requirements listed in subsection (g) and in 40 CFR 441.50 (a) and (b). 
(c)  "Existing source" refers to dental dischargers that were discharging prior to July 14, 2017. Existing sources must be in compliance with the standards by July 14, 2020, and must submit a one-time compliance report by October 12, 2020. In the event that ownership is transferred, a new one-time compliance report must be submitted within 90 days of the transfer. 
(d)  "New source" refers to dental dischargers that started discharging after July 14, 2017. New sources and any ownership transfer after July 15, 2020, must be in compliance with the standards immediately and must submit a one-time compliance report within 90 days after the first discharge. An amalgam separator installation form must also be completed and returned to the utility. 
(e)  The utility shall provide forms for reporting the information required by subsections (c) and (d). 
(f)  If a malfunction with the amalgam separator is discovered, this malfunction must be documented and repaired or replaced within ten business days. 
(g)  Record retention. 
(1)  One time compliance reports must be retained for the entire time that the office is in operation and made available for review at all inspections. 
(2)  The manufacturer's user manual must be retained for the life of the separator, be posted near the amalgam separator, and be made available for review at all inspections. 
(3)  Amalgam separator logs including checks, routine maintenance, and repairs must be posted near the amalgam separator and retained for a period of at least three years and be made available for review at all inspections. The separator must be inspected according to the user manual to ensure proper operation and maintenance; this inspection must be documented on the log. 
(4)  Certificates verifying the proper disposal and recycling of amalgam waste buckets and containers from the amalgam separators must be retained for a period of at least three years and be made available for review at all inspections. 
(h)  Dental offices shall allow the utility to inspect the amalgam separator, amalgam waste storage areas, and all above listed records. Inspections shall occur during the normal operating schedule of the dental office. The utility shall inspect dental offices according to appointments made in advance, as long as this advanced notice does not impede enforcement of this section. 
(i)  Any violation of the above listed subsections is considered a failure to comply with applicable standards and requirements and constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act. This could potentially subject the dental discharger to federal civil and criminal penalties under Section 309 of the Clean Water Act and to civil and criminal penalties under the Racine Wastewater Utility Pretreatment Program. 
(Ord. No. 13-07, pt. 1, 7-17-07; Ord. No. 13-14, pt. 157, 1-20-15; Ord. No. 0016-19, pt. 1, 6-18-19)  
Sec. 98-158. - Fats, oil and grease management at food service establishments. 
(a)  Applicability: This section applies to any industrial, commercial, or institutional (ICI) food service establishment associated with food preparation, food service and/or kitchen cleanup. If a food service establishment is limited to service that does not involve disposing of food waste or food preparation cleanup waste into the sewerage system, then this section does not apply. 
(1)  Residential discharge. Residents are governed generally by section 98-151 which prohibits the discharge of any pollutant or wastewater that will negatively affect the sewer collection system and/or POTW and receiving waters. 
(b)  Grease removal devices. ICI food service establishments (FSEs) which discharge any fats, oils and grease associated with food preparation, food service and kitchen cleanup shall adhere to section 98-151 and subsection 98-152(b)(3). Grease and oil interceptors or traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of the general manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil (interceptors shall not be required for residential users). The plumbing inspector of the municipality in which the FSE resides must approve the installation of any grease removal device. 
(1)  Grease removal devices are the property of the FSE; therefore, the FSE is responsible for proper sizing and installation of a device by a licensed plumber that ensures acceptable FOG removal to prevent any discharge to the sewer system. 
(2)  FSEs shall ensure adequate cleaning and maintenance of any grease and oil interceptors, as necessary, to keep the removal devices in proper working order. This includes, but is not limited to: 
a.  Following manufacturer's recommendations; 
b.  Following all applicable best management practices (BMPs) (subsection 98-158(c);

Sec. 98-202. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  The basis for computation of the charge for stormwater services to all lots and parcels of land within the city is established under this section. The amount of charge to be imposed, the establishment of formulas for the calculation of charges, the creation of customer classifications for the imposition of charges, and changes in such charges, formulas and customer classifications may be made by further resolution of the common council. All charges established pursuant to this section shall be fair and reasonable. A schedule of current charges shall be maintained on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  Charges shall be imposed to recover all or a portion of the costs of the stormwater utility. Such charges, which shall be established pursuant to further resolution of the common council, may include the following components: 
(1)  Base charge. A base charge may be imposed on all property in the city. The base charge is established in recognition of the fact that all properties in the city receive services from the stormwater management activities of the city and that all property contributes to some degree to the stormwater discharge that must be managed by the city. The base charge shall be assessed to collect the administrative costs of the stormwater utility and may include capital, operating and maintenance costs of the stormwater utility that are not recovered by other means. The base charge may be based on the size of a lot or parcel of land or other reasonable method. 
(2)  Equivalent runoff unit charge. An ERU charge may be imposed on all property that has an impervious area. The charge shall be assessed based upon the impervious area as reasonably determined by the city for a typical residential unit of property. Other units of property will be charged multiples of the ERU based on the impervious area of the property. 
(3)  Special charge. A special charge may be imposed on property that is in an area specially benefited by a particular stormwater management facility. This charge will be developed to reflect the benefits in a particular area that may not be appropriate to allocate to property throughout the city, and will be calculated on an ERU basis. 
(c)  The property owner shall be responsible for completing the stormwater utility service application form any time a building permit is issued, exclusive of those issued to existing single family residences, or when a site plan review is conducted. The form shall be provided by the chief building inspector with each application for a building permit (exclusive of building permits for single family residences) or application for site plan review. Failure to submit a completed stormwater utility service application form or providing false information on said form, shall result in denial of both the building permit and stormwater utility service applications and shall be a violation of this article. Additionally, the owner shall be liable for stormwater charges under this section for the improvement from the date construction of the improvement began. 
(d)  The common council may establish rates and classifications by further resolution as will be likely to provide a reasonable and fair distribution of the costs of the stormwater utility. In the event the owner and non-owner users of a particular property are not the same, the liability for the charges attributable to that property shall be that of the owner. 
(e)  Adjustments for nonresidential property. 
(1)  Requests for adjustments of the ERUs allocated to a parcel of property shall be limited to the nonresidential customer class. All such requests shall be submitted to the commissioner, who shall have the authority to develop and administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of ERUs as established in this section. 
(2)  A nonresidential customer may at any time, subject to the conditions herein provided, submit a written request seeking an adjustment of the ERUs allocated to a parcel of property, which request shall describe in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
(3)  A nonresidential customer requesting adjustments may be required, at his, her or its own expense, to provide supplemental information to the commissioner including, but not limited to, survey data approved by a registered land surveyor and engineering reports approved by a professional engineer. Failure to provide such information within the time limits established by the commissioner, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustments request. 
(4)  Following submission of a completed adjustments request and all required information, the commissioner shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges based on the ERUs allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to a request for review. In considering an adjustment request, the commissioner shall consider whether the calculation of the ERUs for the property is correct. 
(5)  The commissioner's decision shall be mailed to the address provided on the adjustments request by first class mail and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
(6)  Appeal from the commissioner's decision concerning an ERU adjustment request shall be governed by subsection (i) below, except that no concurrent payment of any fees is required. Appeals shall be in writing and shall specify the grounds for challenging the commissioner's decision. Appeals shall specifically address the commissioner's conclusions and shall not merely repeat the grounds for the initial adjustments request. Appeals shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after the date of mailing the commissioner's decision. Failure to timely and properly appeal shall deprive the board of jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
(f)  The charges established will be billed to the utility customer at the same time and in the same manner as the city water utility bill, as an additional fee for stormwater services. Such charges shall be payable in the same manner as a water utility bill. Bills for stormwater utility charges shall be mailed to the utility customer of the property to which the bill relates. 
(g)  A late payment charge as established by further resolution of the common council will be added to bills not paid within the allotted period. 
(h)  All stormwater service charges shall be taxed and collected, and shall be a lien upon the property served, in the same manner as water service charges are taxed and collected under the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 66.0809. 
(i)  The city elects not to be subject to the administrative review provisions contained within Wis. Stats. ch. 68, and establishes the following as a complete and final review procedure: As a condition precedent to challenging any stormwater utility charge, the charge must be timely paid in full under protest to the city. An appeal shall be to the board and can be undertaken only by filing a written appeal with the commissioner and the board concurrent with the date of payment. The appeal shall specify all grounds for challenge to the amount of the charge and shall state the amount of charge that the appellant considers to be appropriate. Failure to timely and properly appeal shall deprive the board of jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
(j)  Variances and appeals shall be determined by the board under procedures prescribed Wis. Stat. 62.23(7)(e). 
(k)  Reserved. 
(l)  If the result of any appeal or judicial review is that a refund is due, it will be payable by the city within 60 days after the written determination. Any further resulting adjustment will appear on subsequent bills. 
(m)  Alternative method to collect stormwater charges. In addition to any other method for collection of the charges established under this article or subsequent resolution, stormwater charges may and are hereby authorized to be levied and imposed on property as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. The mailing of the bill for stormwater utility charges to a property owner shall serve as notice to the property owner that failure to pay the charges when due may result in the charges being imposed pursuant to the authority of Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. The procedures contained in therein shall govern such notice and further collection procedures. 
(n)  Budget excess revenues. Stormwater utility finances shall be accounted for in a separate stormwater utility fund. The finance director shall prepare an annual budget, which shall include all operation and maintenance costs, debt service and other costs related to the operation of the stormwater utility. The budget is subject to approval by the common council. The costs shall be spread over the rate classifications as determined by the common council. Any excess of revenues over expenditures in a year will be retained by the fund for subsequent years' needs. 
(o)  Penalty. A person convicted of violating any provision of this article shall, upon conviction, pay a forfeiture not less than $50.00 and not more than $1,000.00 for each offense, plus costs and assessments. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.

ARTICLE VII. - POSTCONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
 
Sec. 98-401. - Authority. 
(a)  This article is adopted by the common council under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 62.234. This article supersedes all provisions enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23 that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Wis. Stats. § 62.234, Wis. Stats. § 62.23 applies to this article and to any amendments to this article. 
(b)  The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the common council. 
(c)  The common council hereby designates the commissioner of public works or designee ("commissioner") to administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(d)  The requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
(2)  Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under Wisconsin Administrative Code § NR 151.004. 
(Ord. No. 21-04, pt. 1, 8-2-04)  
Sec. 98-402. - Findings of fact. 
The common council finds that uncontrolled, postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(6)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(7)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding. 
(Ord. No. 21-04, pt. 1, 8-2-04)  
Sec. 98-403. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term, postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve groundcover and scenic beauty, and promote sound economic growth. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter, and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(b)  Intent. It is the intent of the common council that this article regulate post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The common council acknowledges that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, best management practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16, for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council, it is the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

For new development, by design, reduce to the maximum extent practicable, the total suspended solids load by 80 percent, based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. No person shall be required to exceed an 80 percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the requirements of this subdivision. 
b.  For redevelopment, by design, reduce to the maximum extent practicable, the total suspended solids load by 40 percent, based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. No person shall be required to exceed a 40 percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the requirements of this subdivision. 
c.  For in-fill development under five acres that occurs within ten years after October 1, 2002, by design, reduce to the maximum extent practicable, the total suspended solids load by 40 percent, based on an average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. No person shall be required to exceed a 40 percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the requirements of this subdivision. 
d.

However, if site specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
2.  Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)g.1, the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
(4)  Protective areas. 
a.  "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this paragraph, "protective area" excludes any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
1.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, and for wetlands in areas of special natural resource interest as specified in § NR 103.04, 75 feet. 
2.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a United States geological survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever is more current, 50 feet. 
3.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
4.  For highly susceptible wetlands, 50 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, shrub swamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows, shallow marshes, deep marshes and seasonally flooded basins. Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in accordance with § NR 103.08(1m). This subparagraph does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. 
5.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass. 
6.  In subsections (c)(4)a.1., 4. and 5., determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in § NR 103.03. 
7.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
b.  This paragraph applies to postconstruction sites located within a protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to subsection (c)(4)d. 
c.  The following requirements shall be met: 
1.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to the maximum extent practicable. The stormwater management plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction. 
2.  Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
3.  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins that are designed to control pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the protective area. 
d.  This subsection (c)(4) does not apply to: 
1.  Redevelopment postconstruction sites. 
2.  In-fill development areas less than five acres. 
3.  Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts. 
4.  Structures constructed in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 59.692(1v). 
5.  Post-construction sites from which runoff does not enter the surface water, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability. 
(5)  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
(6)  Swale treatment for transportation facilities. 
a.  Applicability. Except as provided in subsection 2., transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal meet all of the requirements of this section, if the swales are designed to the maximum extent practicable to do all of the following: 
1.  Be vegetated. However, where appropriate, non-vegetative measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams. 
2.  Carry runoff through a swale for 200 feet or more in length that is designed with a flow velocity no greater than 1.5 feet per second for the peak flow generated using either a two-year, 24-hour design storm or a two-year storm with a duration equal to the time of concentration as appropriate. If a swale of 200 feet in length cannot be designed with a flow velocity of 1.5 feet per second or less, then the flow velocity shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. 
b.  Exemptions. The commissioner may, consistent with water quality standards, require other provisions of this section be met on a transportation facility with an average daily travel of vehicles greater than 2500 and where the initial surface water of the state that the runoff directly enters is any of the following: 
1.  An outstanding resource water. 
2.  An exceptional resource water. 
3.  Waters listed in § 303(d) of the federal clean water act that are identified as impaired in whole or in part, due to nonpoint source impacts. 
4.  Waters where targeted performance standards are developed under Wisconsin Administrative Code § NR 151.004, to meet water quality standards. 
(d)  General considerations for on-site and off-site stormwater management measures. The following considerations shall be observed in managing runoff: 
(1)  Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Emergency overland flow for all storm water facilities shall be provided to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream property or public safety. 
(e)  Location and regional treatment option. 
(1)  The BMPs may be located on-site or off-site as part of a regional stormwater device, practice or system. 
(2)  Post-construction runoff within a nonnavigable surface water that flows into a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not required to meet the performance standards of this article. Postconstruction BMPs may be located in nonnavigable surface waters. 
(3)  Except as allowed under subsection (c)(4), postconstruction runoff from new development shall meet the postconstruction performance standards prior to entering a navigable surface water. 
(4)  Postconstruction runoff from any development within a navigable surface water that flows into a BMP is not required to meet the performance standards of this article if: 
a.  The BMP was constructed prior to the effective date of this article and the BMP either received a permit issued under Wis. Stats. ch. 30, or the BMP did not require a Wis. Stats. ch. 30 permit; and 
b.  The BMP is designed to provide runoff treatment from future upland development. 
(5)  Runoff from existing development, redevelopment and in-fill areas shall meet the postconstruction performance standards in accordance with this paragraph.

Sec. 98-431. - Findings of fact. 
The common council finds that illicit discharges and connections have a significant impact upon water resources and on the health, safety and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life and recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(Ord. No. 1-05, pt. 1, 2-1-05)  
Sec. 98-432. - Purpose and intent. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Illicit connection means any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, which allows an illegal discharge to enter the storm drain system including, but not limited to, any conveyances which allow any non-stormwater discharge including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water to enter the storm drain system and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection had been allowed, permitted, or approved by a government agency prior to the adoption of this article. 
Person means any individual, association, organization, partnership, firm, corporation other entity recognized by law and acting as either the owner or as the owner's agent. 
Storm drainage system means publicly-owned facilities by which stormwater is collected and/or conveyed, including but not limited to any roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, gutters, curbs, inlets, piped storm drains, pumping facilities, retention and detention basins, natural and human-made or altered drainage channels, reservoirs, and other drainage structures. 
(Ord. No. 1-05, pt. 1, 2-1-05)

ARTICLE IX. - SANITARY SEWER MAINTENANCE FEE 
 
Sec. 98-436. - Generally. 
(a)  Creation. There is hereby created and established a sanitary sewer maintenance fee for all properties within the City of Racine served by a sanitary lateral. The operation of the publicly owned sanitary sewer collection system and all publicly owned sanitary sewer laterals within the public right-of-way or within an easement to the City of Racine shall be under the supervision of the commissioner of public works. 
(b)  Authority. Pursuant to the authority granted to the city under Wis. Stats. § 6.068, there are hereby created a sanitary sewer maintenance fee. 
(c)  Definitions. The following definitions shall be used throughout this article unless otherwise specifically provided: 
Active lateral means a sanitary lateral that extends from the sanitary sewer main, manhole or other lateral to the public right-of-way or easement, and connects to a building or facility. 
Committee means the public works and services committee of the common council. 
Commissioner means the commissioner of public works or designee. 
Inactive lateral means a sanitary lateral that extends from the sanitary sewer main, manhole or other lateral to the public right-of-way or easement but does not connect to a building or facility. 
Lateral means the sewer pipe extended from the sanitary sewer, manhole or other lateral, including the connection to the sanitary sewer within the public right-of-way or easement. It includes both active and inactive laterals. 
Private lateral means a sewer pipe from the public right-of-way or easement to the facilities served. 
Sanitary sewer means a sewer that carries domestic sewage and industrial wastes, and to which storm, surface, ground and unpolluted cooling or process waters are not intentionally allowed except by specific permit.

(Ord. No. 06-14, pt. 1, 6-3-14)  
Sec. 98-437. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  The basis for computation of the charge and rate for sanitary lateral services to all laterals within the city is established under this section. All charges established pursuant to this section shall be fair and reasonable. A schedule of current charges shall be maintained on file in the office of the commissioner of public works. 
(b)  The basis for computation of the sanitary sewer maintenance fee is as follows: 
(1)  A sanitary sewer maintenance fee shall be imposed on all property in the city for each lateral in the right-of-way or easement adjacent to the parcel. The count of active and inactive laterals will be determined based on a review and count from the current City of Racine GIS database. The sanitary sewer maintenance fee is established in recognition of the fact that all properties in the city receive services from sanitary lateral management activities of the city. Each property will be charged for a minimum of one sanitary lateral unless it meets one of the exemptions in subsection 98-437(d). 
(2)  Condo parcels shall be billed a pro-rated amount based on the number of laterals servicing the property divided by the number of condo units on the property. 
(3)  The basis of the per lateral charge is the total cost of activities regarding the sanitary sewer collection system including all publicly owned mains and publicly owned sanitary sewers. This cost shall be divided by the total number of active and inactive sanitary sewer laterals within the City of Racine. This cost is over and above the user fee paid for the operations of the wastewater treatment facilities, as billed by the Racine Wastewater Utility. 
(c)  The common council may approve fee and classification changes by further resolution as needed. In the event the owner and non-owner users of a particular property are not the same, the liability for the charges attributable to that property shall be that of the owner. 
(d)  Exemptions - A property may be exempt from receiving a sanitary sewer maintenance fee if one of the following requirements is met: 
(1)  The parcel has a vacant land use code (LUC) in the current year city tax roll and no laterals serving the parcel in the Racine GIS database. 
(2)  The parcel contains a structure that does not receive sanitary sewer service, regardless of whether a lateral is present in the Racine GIS database. Allowable exemptions include condo garages, condo storage units, condo boat slips, garages or storage units. Final determination for any other exempt parcels shall be at the discretion of the commissioner. 
(3)  The parcel contains a building that covers multiple parcels, under a single ownership. Not every parcel is required to receive a sanitary sewer maintenance fee if no lateral is present in the Racine GIS database as long as at least one parcel containing the building is billed. Final determination for exempt parcels shall be at the discretion of the commissioner. 
(4)  The parcel does not contain any buildings or structures, and no laterals serving the parcel are in the Racine GIS database. Allowable exemptions include parks or other public open space, cemeteries, public utility ROW, parking lots and riparian areas. Final determination for exempt parcels shall be at the discretion of the commissioner. 
(5)  A parcel is located within the City of Racine but is accessed from the right-of-way of a neighboring jurisdiction, if sanitary service is provided by sewer infrastructure owned and maintained by the neighboring jurisdiction. 
(6)  Other individual exemptions will be examined on a case-by-case basis. The basis for exemption shall be a parcel with no laterals serving the parcel after review of the Racine GIS database and a reasonable assumption that the parcel is not receiving sanitary sewer service from a City of Racine sewer. Final determination for exempt parcels shall be at the discretion of the commissioner. 
(e)  Adjustments. 
(1)  Requests for adjustments of the sanitary sewer maintenance fee charged to each property shall be submitted to the commissioner. 
(2)  A property owner may at any time, subject to the conditions herein provided, submit a written request seeking an adjustment of the sanitary sewer maintenance fee, which request shall describe in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
(3)  A property owner requesting adjustments may be required, at his, her or its own expense, to provide supplemental information to the commissioner including, but not limited to, survey data approved by a registered land surveyor, information from a plumbing contractor, and engineering reports approved by a professional engineer. Failure to provide such information within the time limits established by the commissioner, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustments request. 
(4)  Following submission of a completed adjustments request and all required information, the commissioner shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges based on the sanitary laterals allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to a request for review. In considering an adjustment request, the commissioner shall consider whether sanitary sewer maintenance fee for the property is correct. 
(5)  The commissioner's decision shall be mailed to the address provided on the adjustments request by first-class mail and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
(6)  Appeal from the commissioner's decision concerning a sanitary sewer maintenance fee adjustment request shall be governed by subsection (i) below, except that no concurrent payment of any fees is required. Appeals shall be in writing and shall specify the grounds for challenging the commissioner's decision. Appeals shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after the date of mailing the commissioner's decision. Failure to timely and properly appeal shall be considered a jurisdictional failure. 
(f)  The charges established will be billed to the property owner at the same time and in the same manner as the city tax bill, as an additional fee for sanitary sewer maintenance services. Such charges shall be payable in the same manner as a tax bill. Bills for sanitary sewer maintenance charges shall be mailed to the owner of the property to which the bill relates. 
(g)  A late payment charge as established by further resolution of the common council will be added to bills not paid within the allotted period. 
(h)  All sanitary sewer maintenance charges shall be taxed and collected, and shall be a lien upon the property. 
(i)  If the result of any appeal or judicial review is that a refund is due, it will be payable by the city within 60 days after the written determination. Any further resulting adjustment will appear on subsequent bills. The limitation of adjustment or credit refunded shall be for a maximum of two years. 
(j)  Sanitary sewer maintenance charge finances shall be accounted for in a separate sanitary sewer maintenance fund. The commissioner shall prepare an annual budget, which shall include all operation and maintenance costs, debt service and other costs related to the operation of the sanitary sewer maintenance utility. The budget is subject to approval by the common council. The costs shall be spread over the rate classifications as determined by the common council. Any excess of revenues over expenditures in a year will be retained by the fund for subsequent years' needs. 
(k)  Penalty. A person convicted of violating any provision of this article shall, upon conviction, pay a forfeiture not less than $50.00 and not more than $500.00 for each offense. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 06-14, pt. 1, 6-3-14)  
Sec. 98-438. - Responsibility of the city to repair. 
The City of Racine will repair sanitary sewer laterals which fail within the street right-of-way or city easement. Failures refer to structural defects such as a crushed lateral or severely offset joints that are currently or are exhibiting a high likelihood of blocking flow from the building or facility to the degree that they are currently or may in the near future, cause backups to occur. Failures do not include minor offset joints, the cleaning or unclogging of the lateral due to roots, deposits, grease, chemicals or other foreign materials. 
The City of Racine is not responsible for any maintenance of the lateral or any failures of the private lateral. 
To make a claim to the city for a failed lateral the property owner must provide sufficient information to the commissioner of public works/city engineer's office to allow for a comprehensive review by engineering staff. The property owner has the responsibility in this regard, to hire a sewer cleaner or a plumber to clean and inspect the lateral with a video camera. The video camera must have the capability to show the accurate footage and location of the damaged area above ground. If the lateral is blocked and submerged and a camera cannot be used to show the location of the damaged area, the contractor must mark the location of the collapsed pipe above ground. If the marked location is in the right-of-way or easement of the City of Racine, the property owner has the responsibility of making the necessary repairs, subject to an inspection by the City of Racine. If the blockage is the result of crushed lateral or severely offset joints the City of Racine will reimburse the property owner for the repair work. 
If the city engineer disagrees with the contractor's assessment, craftsmanship, or its inability to perform these acts the property owner has the responsibility to provide such additional information, which will demonstrate that the damaged area was in the public right-of-way. Obtaining such information is the sole responsibility and expense of the property owner. 
The City of Racine does not maintain an on-call sanitary sewer repair service, and calls to the city will be answered during normal business hours. If a failure requires immediate repair, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner and/or contractor to provide sufficient documentation that the failure meets the requirements previously listed for city repair. The property owner and/or contractor may then perform the required repairs and document the procedure used for reimbursement from the city. The property owner and/or contractor is still responsible for obtaining all city required permits prior to beginning any work. 
The City of Racine shall reimburse the property owner or the contractor the costs of investigating the problem, but will not pay for previous cleanings, damage to the building or to its contents.

Sec. 110-45. - Terms of weight, measure or count. 
The declaration of the quantity of a particular commodity shall be expressed in such terms of weight, measure or count, or a combination of count and weight, measure or size, as have been firmly established in general consumer usage and trade custom and as shall give accurate information as to the quantity of the commodity. If there exists no firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom with respect to the terms used in expressing such declaration of quantity, the declaration shall be in terms of liquid measure if the commodity is liquid, or in terms of weight if the commodity is solid, semisolid, viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid. If the commodity is packaged in an aerosol container, the declaration shall be in terms of weight (including the propellant).

Sec. 110-47. - Units with two or more meanings. 
When any unit of weight or measure having two or more distinct meanings is employed in a declaration of quantity, the declaration shall identify the particular meaning of the term as it is employed in the declaration. For example, distinction shall be made between "avoirdupois" and "fluid" ounces, and between "liquid" and "dry" quarts and pints. Such distinction may be omitted when, by association of terms (as in "one pound four ounces" or "one pint eight fluid ounces"), the proper meaning is obvious. 
(Code 1973, § 23.15.060)  
Sec. 110-48. - Prescribed units. 
(a)  A declaration of quantity shall be expressed in terms of the largest whole unit of weight or measure, for example, one quart liquid shall be expressed as "one quart liquid" and not as "two pints liquid" or "32 fluid ounces." When this results in a whole number and a fraction, the fraction may be expressed in its equivalent in the next smaller whole unit, for example, 1¾ quarts liquid may be expressed as "one quart, 1½ pints liquid" or "one quart one pint eight fluid ounces," but not as "one quart 24 fluids ounces"; 1¼ pounds may be expressed as "one pound four ounces". 
(b)  If there exists, with respect to a particular commodity, a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom to express the declaration of quantity as a fraction of a unit of weight or measure larger than the total quantity being declared or as a number of units smaller than the largest whole unit of weight or measure involved, the declaration, if informative to consumers, may be made in accordance with such usage and custom. 
(Code 1973, § 23.15.070)  
Sec. 110-49. - Reduction of fractions. 
(a)  Declarations of quantity may employ only binary-submultiple common fractions or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms, and, except in the case of drugs, a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. 
(b)  If there exists with respect to a particular commodity a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom contrary to the requirement for reduction of a common fraction to its lowest terms, the declaration may be made in accordance with such usage and custom.

Sec. 110-57. - Variations from declared quantity. 
(a)  Variations from the declared net weight, measure or count shall be permitted when caused by unavoidable deviations in weighing, measuring or counting the contents of individual packages that occur in good packaging practice, but such variations shall not be permitted to such extent that the average of the quantities in the packages of a particular commodity comprising either a shipment or other delivery of the commodity or a lot of the commodity that is kept, offered or exposed for sale, or sold, is below the quantity stated, and no unreasonable shortage in any package shall be permitted, even though overages in other packages in the same shipment, delivery or lot compensate for such shortage. Variations above the declared quantity shall not be unreasonably large. 
(b)  When the minimum quantity is declared, no packaging variations below the declared minimum shall be permitted, and variations above the declared minimum shall not be unreasonably large. 
(c)  The magnitude of variations permitted under this section shall, in the case of any shipment, delivery or lot, be determined by the facts in the individual case.

DIVISION 2. - OTHER THAN FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
 
Sec. 114-146. - Purpose. 
The development and execution of this chapter is based upon the division of the community into districts within which the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use in the particular location. Such conditional uses fall into two categories: 
(1)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest. 
(2)  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(a))  
Sec. 114-147. - Exception. 
This division shall not apply to planned developments as provided for in division 3 of this article. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(m))  
Sec. 114-148. - Initiation of conditional use. 
Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use such land for one or more of the conditional uses provided for in this chapter in the zoning district in which the land is located. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(b))  
Sec. 114-149. - Application. 
An application for a conditional use shall be filed with the zoning administrator on a form prescribed by the zoning administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data as may be prescribed by the planning, heritage, and design commission, and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set forth in section 114-154. Such application shall be forwarded from the zoning administrator to the planning, heritage, and design commission for review and recommendation to the common council.

(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(g); Ord. No. 0026-19, pt. 47, 11-12-19)  
Sec. 114-154. - Standards. 
No conditional use shall be recommended by the planning, heritage, and design commission unless such commission shall find that: 
(1)  The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to, or endanger, the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare; 
(2)  The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood; 
(3)  The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district; 
(4)  Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided; 
(5)  Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;

Sec. 114-155. - Conditions, guarantees, minor changes of conditional use permits. 
(a)  Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the planning, heritage, and design commission may recommend and the common council may stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the conditional use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in section 114-154. In all cases in which conditional uses are granted, the common council shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with and proof of compliance. 
(b)  The planning, heritage, and design commission may approve minor changes in the conditional use permit which do not change the concept or intent of the development. "Minor changes" shall include such things as signs, or lighting location and design, etc. 
(c)  The person issued the conditional use permit and any successor in interest shall have a continuing duty to comply with the conditions and restrictions prescribed in such permit and in any amendment thereto. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(i)(1), (2); Ord. No. 26-04, pts. 2, 3, 8-17-04; Ord. No. 0026-19, pt. 50, 11-12-19)  
Sec. 114-156. - Review of conditional use permits. 
(a)  Conditional use permits may be reviewed from time to time for compliance with conditions prescribed by the common council, by the zoning administrator on his own volition, or by the zoning administrator upon recommendation by the planning, heritage, and design commission. If the zoning administrator should find that any of the conditions or restrictions made a part of such permit have not been complied with by the person to whom the permit was issued and any successor in interest, the administrator may initiate proceedings to revoke the permit or the zoning administrator or designee may issue a citation to such person for violation of section 114-155(c), with respect to conditional use permits or amendments to conditional use permits where issued on or after September 1, 2004. Such proceedings shall consist of a written notification sent by the administrator to the permit holder by certified United States postage at the last known post office address of the permit holder. This notice shall specify the condition or conditions which have not been complied with by the permit holder. The notice shall further advise the permit holder that steps must be taken to gain compliance by the permit holder within a specified period of time not to exceed 60 days, which time shall be determined by the administrator. The notice shall recite that failure to take the required corrective measures may result in revocation of the permit. 
(b)  The zoning administrator shall have the power to enforce compliance and to revoke any conditional use permit where such conditions have not been complied with and proper notice has been given as described in this section. Upon the effective date of the revocation order by the administrator, the conditional use permit shall cease to exist. The property subject to the conditional use permit shall thereupon revert to the zoning classification in effect at the time of the revocation under this Code and penalties for noncompliance as provided in section 114-136 may be invoked. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by a revocation order issued by the zoning administrator may appeal that order to the city planning, heritage, and design commission. The planning, heritage, and design commission may hear such an appeal before the entire commission or may appoint a panel of planning, heritage, and design commission members to conduct an appeals hearing. Proceedings in appeals shall conform to Wis. Stats. ch. 68. 
(d)  Appeals of revocations of conditional use permits shall be filed with the secretary of the planning, heritage, and design commission in care of the city clerk within 30 days of the mailing date of the order of revocation.

DIVISION 3. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
 
Sec. 114-171. - Purposes. 
(a)  Planned developments are of such substantially different character from other conditional uses that specific and additional standards and exceptions are established in this division to govern the actions of the planning, heritage, and design commission and common council. 
(b)  To the extent that specific standards and exceptions with respect to setbacks, signs, off-street parking and the like, are set forth on the final plan or are contained in the conditions governing the planned development, such specific standards and exceptions shall govern such development to the exclusion of requirements that would otherwise apply to the zoning district in which such planned development is located. 
(c)  This division is applicable to all planned developments approved after August 1, 1979. 
(d)  A planned development conditional use is a privilege to be earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established in this division. The planning, heritage, and design commission and common council may require any reasonable condition or design consideration which will promote proper development or benefit to the community. It is not intended that the common council automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density increase in the case of each planned development. The common council shall grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit accruing to the city as a result of the planned development. As a condition for approval, each planned development must be compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning district or districts within which it is located, and each planned development shall be consistent with the objectives of the city land use plan. 
(e)  Some specific purposes of the planned development procedure are: 
(1)  Residential planned development: To offer recreational opportunities close to home, to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the conservation of streams and local spots of natural beauty, to add to the sense of spaciousness through the preservation of natural green spaces, to counteract the effects of urban monotony and congestion in the streets, to encourage cooperative relationships between neighbors and participation by all age groups in the use and care of local open space tracts in new residential subdivisions, to promote harmonious architecture between adjacent dwellings or institutional buildings, and to encourage the placement of structures in proper relationship to the natural characteristics of the site. 
(2)  Business or commercial planned development: To promote the cooperative development of business or commercial centers each with adequate off-street parking, to control access points on thoroughfares, to separate pedestrian and automobile traffic, to aid in stabilizing property values, to develop centers of size and location compatible with the market potential, to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped green spaces and to encourage harmonious architecture between adjacent commercial structures and between home and commercial structures. 
(3)  Industrial planned development: To promote the establishment of industrial parks, to permit groups of industrial buildings with integrated design and a coordinated physical plan, to encourage recreational facilities within industrial areas and to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped green spaces. 
(4)  Traditional neighborhood development: To allow the development and redevelopment of land consistent with the design principles of traditional neighborhoods. Traditional neighborhood development uses land and public infrastructure efficiently, allows a variety of housing options, promotes energy conservation by facilitating walking and other transportation modes as alternatives to driving, provides convenience by locating complementary office, retail, and civic development near to housing, and fosters a sense of community by including features that encourage interaction among people. 
The document identified as "A Model Ordinance for Traditional Neighborhood Development," dated April 2001, published by the University of Wisconsin Extension pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.1027(2), shall serve as a non-exclusive guidebook to assist in further defining the various aspects of this form of urban design, along with such other sources of guidance the planning, heritage, and design commission and common council may choose to consult.

Sec. 114-172. - Preapplication conference. 
(a)  Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a planned development, the developer shall request a preapplication conference with the zoning administrator and director of planning. The request for a preapplication conference shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. 
(b)  The purpose of the preapplication conference is to allow the developer to present a general concept of his proposed development prior to the preparation of detailed plans. For this purpose, the presentation shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Written letter of intent from the developer establishing his intentions as to development of the land. 
(2)  Topographic survey and location map. 
(3)  Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, dwelling type and density, street and lot arrangement, and tentative lot sizes. 
(4)  Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewer disposal, surface drainage, and street improvements. 
(c)  The zoning administrator and director of planning shall advise the developer of the zoning requirements and city plans which might affect the proposed development as well as the procedural steps for approval. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(n)(2)a)  
Sec. 114-173. - Preliminary plan. 
(a)  The preliminary plan of the planned development shall be filed with the zoning administrator, who shall in turn forward copies to the secretary of the planning, heritage, and design commission for its consideration and public hearing. The planning, heritage, and design commission may request review of the planned development by, and recommendations from, appropriate city and utility company departments and offices. The required procedure for consideration and approval of the preliminary plan shall be as provided in this section. 
(b)  A written application for approval of a planned development shall be made on forms and in the manner prescribed by the city. The application shall be accompanied by a fee consistent with the approved fee schedule. The preliminary plan and supporting data shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 114-179. 
(c)  The planning, heritage, and design commission shall hold a public hearing on the application for a planned development in accordance with section 114-150. Following the public hearing and review of the preliminary planned development and supporting data, the planning, heritage, and design commission shall send its findings and recommendations to the common council, which shall, within 60 days, approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the plan. 
(d)  Approval of a preliminary planned development plan shall not constitute approval of the final plan, rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the preparation of the final plan or plans. The final plan shall be submitted by the developer not later than 180 days (or such additional time as may be authorized by the planning, heritage, and design commission and common council from time to time) after approval of the preliminary plan. The preliminary and final plan may be filed and approved simultaneously, if all requirements of this division are met. 
(e)  Upon approval of the preliminary planned development plan by the common council, a record shall be prepared, including findings of fact, recommendations of the city departments and offices, exceptions, bonuses granted, conditions applied, and modifications ordered.

(a)  The final planned development plan shall conform substantially to the preliminary plan as approved, and if desired by the developer, it may be submitted in stages with each stage reflecting a portion of the approved preliminary plan which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. The required procedure for approval of a final plan shall be as provided in this section. 
(b)  The final plan and supporting data shall be filed with the zoning administrator and forwarded by him to the secretary of the planning, heritage, and design commission for certification that the final plan is in conformity with these regulations and in agreement with the approved preliminary plan. All final plans shall be accompanied by a written construction schedule for the development. 
(c)  After review of the final plan and supporting data, the planning, heritage, and design commission shall send its findings and recommendations to the common council, which shall approve or disapprove the plan within 45 days after submittal by the developer. Disapproval of the final plan shall include a clear statement of the reasons therefor.

Sec. 114-176. - Compliance with final plan, responsibility of lot owners. 
If, following approval of a final planned development plan, there shall be diversity of ownership within the planned development, each owner shall be responsible for compliance with the final plan only as to the lot then owned by such owner and such lot shall be deemed to be in compliance with the final plan if the owner thereof shall have complied with the conditions applicable to such lot, and the failure of any other owner to be in compliance with the final plan shall not affect such complying owner. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(n)(2)e)  
Sec. 114-177. - Changes in the planned development. 
(a)  Generally. A planned development shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded final plan and all supporting data. The recorded final plan and supporting data together with all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and assigns and shall limit and control the use of premises (including the internal use of buildings and structures) and location of structures in the planned development as set forth in this section. 
(b)  Major changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the planned development, including change in location and types of nonresidential land uses, increases in the height of buildings, reductions of proposed open space, more than a 15 percent modification in proportion of housing types, changes in road standards or alignment, utilities, water, electricity and drainage, or changes in the final governing agreements, provisions or covenants, may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plan and supporting data, and following the preliminary approval steps and subsequent amendments of the final planned development plan. 
(c)  Minor changes. The planning, heritage, and design commission may approve minor changes in the planned development which do not change the concept or intent of the development, without going through the preliminary approval steps. "Minor changes" are defined as any change not defined as a major change.

Sec. 114-182. - Mixed use. 
The planning, heritage, and design commission may recommend and the common council may authorize that there be permitted in part of the area of a proposed planned development, and for the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the district in which such development is located, provided that the planning, heritage, and design commission shall find that: 
(1)  The uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the planned development; 
(2)  The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood; 
(3)  Not more than 40 percent of the ground area or of the gross floor area of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by such exception; provided, however, that in a residential planned development not more than eight percent of the total ground area in the planned development shall be devoted to uses first permitted within the commercial districts; and no area within a residential planned development shall be devoted to uses first permitted within the industrial zoning districts.

Sec. 114-183. - Bulk regulations. 
In the case of any planned development, the plan commission may recommend and the common council may authorize exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of such planned development, provided that the plan commission shall find that: 
(1)  Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development, as well as the neighboring property, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed on separate zoning lots; 
(2)  The overall floor area ratio for the planned development would not exceed by more than 30 percent the maximum floor area ratio required for the individual uses in such planned developments, as stipulated in each district; 
(3)  Along the periphery of such planned developments yards shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which such development is located; and 
(4)  In a residential planned development, the maximum number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined by dividing the net development area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the district or districts in which the area is located. Net development area shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside for nonresidential uses from the gross development area, and deducting from the remainder the area required for streets as set forth in the site plan. In no event shall the area for streets be computed at less than ten percent of the gross development area. The area of land set aside for common open space or recreational use may be included in determining the number of dwelling units permitted. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(n)(7))  
Sec. 114-184. - Designation of permanent common open space. 
(a)  Definition. "Permanent common open space" shall be defined as parks, playgrounds, parkway medians, landscaped green space, schools, community centers or other similar areas in public ownership or areas covered by an open space easement. 
(b)  Designation. No plan for a planned development shall be approved unless such plan provided for permanent open space equivalent to at least 15 percent of the total development area in residential planned developments. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(n)(8))  
Sec. 114-185. - Minimum lot area in residential planned developments. 
Provided the overall number of dwelling units per acre, known as density, is not increased beyond the provisions of section 114-183(4), and provided that the permanent common open space is in accord with section 114-184, the planned development may include minimum lot areas per dwelling unit smaller than those normally required in the zoning district. 
(Code 1973, § 16.03.110(n)(9))  
Sec. 114-186. - Mini-planned developments. 
In all zoning districts except R1 and R2 residence districts, planned developments shall be allowed on zoning lots of any size. However, such mini-planned developments shall not qualify for the use exceptions or bulk premiums specified in sections 114-182 and 114-183. A principal purpose of this provision is to accommodate developments of more than one residential building on lots smaller than the minimum required for planned developments. Mini-planned developments shall not result in a density increase.

As requests are received for repairs and alterations, additions and enlargements, changes and expansions, a record shall be kept which lists the nonconforming uses and structures, their present equalized assessed value, and the cost of the work that has been permitted, and the percentage of the structures' total current value the work represents. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030; Ord. No. 3-94, pt. 2, 2-16-94)  
Sec. 114-209. - Repairs and alterations. 
(a)  Building or structure designed or intended for a nonconforming use. Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building or structure, provided that no structural alterations which increase the bulk of the building or structure shall be made in or to a building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, except those required by law or except to make the building or structure and the use thereof conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. For the purpose of this section, repairs shall include the replacement of storage tanks where the safety of operation of the installation requires such replacement, and other replacements of, or substitutions for, machinery or equipment not involving structural alterations to the building or structure, except as provided in this section. 
(b)  Building or structure designed or intended for a permitted use. Repairs, alterations, and structural changes may be made to a nonconforming building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is located, provided such repairs, alterations, or structural changes conform to the regulations of the district in which such building or structure is located. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030(a))  
Sec. 114-210. - Additions and enlargements. 
A nonconforming building or structure which is nonconforming as to bulk, and is designed or intended for a permitted use, shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless such additions or enlargements thereto are made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located, unless such nonconforming building or structure, including all additions and enlargements thereto, shall conform to the following: 
(1)  Applicable regulations concerning the amount of lot area provided per dwelling unit, as provided in this chapter. 
(2)  The allowable floor area ratio, as provided in this chapter. 
(3)  The allowable gross floor area per establishment, as provided in this chapter.

Sec. 114-211. - Relocation of building or structure. 
No building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless every portion of such building or structure which is moved, and the use thereof, is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is to be located. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030(c))  
Sec. 114-212. - Restoration of damaged building or structure designed or intended for a nonconforming use. 
(a)  A nonconforming building or structure which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of restoration to the condition in which it existed before the occurrence shall exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed valuation of the building shall not be restored unless such building or structure, and the use thereof, shall conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(b)  If the damage or destruction to a nonconforming building or structure is less than 50 percent of the equalized assessed valuation of the building or structure, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless such restoration is started within one year from the date of partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion. If the restoration is not started within one year of the calamity and diligently prosecuted to completion, the building or structure shall be removed and the area cleared. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030(d))  
Sec. 114-213. - Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. 
If the nonconforming use of a building, structure, or premises is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, it shall not be renewed, and any subsequent use of the building, structure, or premises shall conform to the use regulations of the district in which such building, structure, or premises is located. A limited, intermittent, or periodic use of the premises, or the failure to remove equipment or fixtures, shall not be considered evidence of continuing occupancy. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030(e))  
Sec. 114-214. - Extension of nonconforming use. 
(a)  Building or structure designed or intended for a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use of part of a building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, may be extended throughout the building or structure in which such use is presently located, but no changes or structural alterations which increase the bulk of the building or structure shall be made unless such changes or structural alterations, and the use thereof, conform to all the regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located. 
(b)  Building or structure designed or intended for a permitted use. The nonconforming use of part of a building or structure, all or substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is located, shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such building or structure, nor changed to any other nonconforming use. 
(c)  Land. The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be expanded or extended beyond the area it occupies. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030(f))  
Sec. 114-215. - Change of nonconforming use. 
(a)  Building or structure designed or intended for a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use of a building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, may be changed to another nonconforming use if: 
(1)  The new use of the building or structure is permitted in a zoning district that would permit the previous use. 
(2)  All or substantially all of the building or structure is constructed so as to accommodate the proposed new use. 
(3)  The zoning administrator finds that the new use conforms with section 114-216(b)(3)a through g. 
(b)  Building or structure designed or intended for a permitted use. No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use when such nonconforming use is located in a building or structure, all or substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a permitted use. 
(c)  Land. The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be changed to any other use, except to a use permitted in the district in which the land is located. 
(Code 1973, § 16.04.030(g))  
Sec. 114-216. - Expansion of nonconforming uses. 
(a)  This section is intended to increase the usefulness and improve the viability of certain commercial zoning districts which are in areas of transition by permitting the controlled change, expansion or alteration of existing nonconforming uses in a compatible manner. It is not intended that this section be used to permit the establishment of a new nonconforming use in an area where none now exists. 
(b)  After the filing of an appeal and appropriate hearings, as provided in article II, division 3, the board of appeals may permit certain nonconforming uses to be expanded, altered or reconstructed beyond limits imposed elsewhere in this chapter, provided the following conditions have also been met: 
(1)  Such nonconforming use must be located in a B-1 neighborhood convenience, B-2 community shopping or B-3 general commercial, B-4 central business or a B-5 central service district. 
(2)  The request has been submitted to the city planning, heritage, and design commission for review and recommendation, and the commission has: 
a.  Submitted a written report to the board of appeals addressing the points in subsection (b)(3), below. 
b.  Determined that the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located is considered in transition and only of marginal use as a retail area. 
c.  Determined that the continued occupancy of the area by the nonconforming use is not in conflict with any existing plan, program or project. 
(3)  The board of appeals finds that: 
a.  The continued establishment, maintenance or operation of the nonconforming use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
b.  The nonconforming use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood. 
c.  The nonconforming use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for other use. 
d.  Adequate utilities, access roads, off-street parking, drainage and other necessary improvements have been or are being provided. 
e.  Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
f.  Continuance of the nonconforming use would be of greater benefit to the area, and general public, than would its termination. 
g.  Sufficient conditions and restrictions have been or will be placed upon the location, construction, maintenance and operation of the nonconforming use to assure that all of the above findings are satisfied. 
h.  The nonconforming use occupies or will occupy a nonresidential structure.

(c)  Front yards shall be as specified in each zoning district. 
(d)  In residential developments containing eight or more units, the yard requirements may be waived in order to encourage innovative design and to provide for such housing types as the atrium or patio house. Such waiver may be obtained only by conditional use permit, as provided within each residential district. 
(e)  For each structure designed, used or occupied, containing at least 20 residential dwelling units or 18,000 square feet of gross floor area, whichever is less, there shall be provided a minimum of 20 percent of the area of the zoning lot for unobstructed open space, left unpaved and suitably landscaped, but shall not include required yard spaces, or space provided for off-street parking. 
(f)  Upon approval of the planning, heritage, and design commission and common council, as evidenced by acceptance of the subdivision plat, a developer shall be allowed to satisfy yard requirements by establishing average setbacks and varying front yards. However, in such instances, the average setbacks or yards shall be at least equal to the minimum prescribed for that district, and the shortest setbacks or yards shall be consistent with public safety and health, and in no case shall any front yard or setback be less than 15 feet in depth. Such exceptional yards or setbacks shall be reflected on the face of the plat. 
(g)  Corner side yards may be reduced to the required least interior side yard width if such corner lot is back-to-back with another corner lot.

(i)  Required side yard and rear yard depths may be measured to the centerline of an alley adjoining such yards. 
(j)  Where an unbroken section of a side wall of a building is not parallel with the side lot line, the required width of any side yard may be applied to the average width; provided, however, that such side yard shall not be narrower than three feet or less than one-half of the required width at any point. 
(k)  For each foot by which a lot existing at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter derived is less than 120 feet deep, six inches may be deducted from the required depth of the rear yard; provided, however, that no required rear yard shall be less than ten feet deep in any case. 
(l)  For each foot by which a lot existing and of record at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter derived is narrower than 50 feet, 3.6 inches may be deducted from the required least width of any side yard and 7.2 inches from the sum of the least width of both side yards for buildings not exceeding three stories in height; provided, however, that no side yard shall be narrower than four feet in any case. 
Where, at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter derived, three-fourths of the lots on both sides of the street within a block front are less than 50 feet wide, an existing plot or unimproved portion of a plot within such block may be deemed to have been divided at the time of enactment of such ordinance into lots of substantially the average width of such three-fourths; provided, however, that no lot shall be deemed to be less than 35 feet wide in any case. 
(m)  When the average depth of existing front yards of existing buildings located within 100 feet on each side of a lot and within the same block as such lot is less than the least front yard depth prescribed for a building on such lot by other provisions of this chapter, then the depth of the front yard of any building on such lot need not exceed the average of the prescribed least depth and the average depth of the existing front yards; nor shall it be required to exceed the average of such otherwise prescribed least depth and the depth of the front yard of an existing building on a lot immediately adjoining such lot, nor the average depth of front yards of existing buildings on the two lots immediately adjoining, if shallower, but shall be at least ten feet in any case. 
The front yard exceptions specified in this subsection shall apply to any story or part of a new building when the average depth of front yards for the corresponding stories or part of such existing buildings, within such 100 feet and within the same block, is less than the least front yard depth otherwise specified in this chapter for such stories or parts respectively. 
(n)  In order to provide adequate vehicular vision clearance in yards, no fence, structure, screening or planting of any kind shall be erected, placed, maintained, or grown on any lot between the heights of 30 inches and seven feet above the curb level or its equivalent within the triangle space formed by two intersecting street lines or the intersection of a street line with an alley line or the intersection of a street line with a private drive and a line joining points on such street lines or street and alley lines or street and private lines, located a minimum distance of 25 feet from the point of intersection of the two street lines or located a minimum distance of ten feet from the point of intersection of a street line and an alley line or of a street line and a private drive line. A fence or wall may be erected and maintained within the vision clearance triangle, except that no such fence shall: 
(1)  Exceed a height of six feet if the fence or wall has 25 percent opacity or less. 
(2)  Exceed a height of 30 inches if the fence or wall has more than 25 percent opacity.

Sec. 114-255. - Building bulk (volume) limitations. 
(a)  Building bulk limitations shall be expressed in terms of minimum yard requirements and maximum building height, or in terms of floor area ratio. In the R1 and R2 districts, all uses are regulated on the basis of maximum building height, whereas uses in all other districts must comply with the floor area ratio limitations prescribed in each zoning district in subdivision II of this division. 
(b)  The floor area ratio requirements shall determine the maximum floor area allowable for the building or buildings (total floor area of both principal and accessory buildings) in direct ratio to the gross area of the zoning lot.

Sec. 114-640. - Preapplication conference. 
Prior to making a formal application for access corridor development, a preapplication conference is required. The purpose of the conference is to acquaint all pertinent city staff with the proposal, and acquire the views and concerns of those participating. The preapplication conference occurs at the conceptual stage of the development when plans are flexible and adjustments are possible. The preapplication conference is also intended to assist the applicant in bringing the plan into conformance with this article and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 31-90, pt. 1, 9-18-90)  
Sec. 114-641. - Submission requirements. 
Applications for access corridor development shall be submitted to the director of city development. The submittal shall include the same materials as required for conditional use review. 
(Ord. No. 31-90, pt. 1, 9-18-90)  
Sec. 114-642. - Evaluation criteria. 
The goals and objectives of the comprehensive general plan, the access corridor plan, and other applicable city plans, criteria, and designs shall be utilized in the review of proposed site plans for access corridor districts. In addition, the following criteria shall also be used to determine whether a proposed site plan fulfills the objectives of this article: 
(1)  Traffic circulation. All vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems shall provide adequate and safe access through the access corridor and to and within the site. Pedestrian and vehicular circulation shall be separated, insofar as is practicable. Curb cuts on the site shall be minimized. 
(2)  Building arrangement. The layout, mass, orientation and height of the structures on the site shall allow for the effective use of the proposed development. Furthermore, such arrangement shall be compatible with development on adjacent property. Also, the arrangement of structures on the site shall be evaluated for their potential impact on the provision of city services, such as access for emergency equipment. 
(3)  Parking and loading layout. Proposed parking lots and truck loading areas shall be designed, located and screened to minimize adverse visual impact on adjacent properties. Parking spaces or aisles shall be no closer than six feet from any public street right-of-way. Adequate perimeter parking lot screening shall be provided. Interior parking lot landscaping is also required where practicable to break up large areas of parking with plant material. Parking lot drainage shall not adversely affect surrounding properties and shall meet city standards. 
(4)  Landscaping. Landscape design shall enhance the overall appearance of the access corridor, create a logical transition to adjoining development, screen incompatible structures and uses, and minimize the visual impact of parking lots on adjacent sites and roadways. Plant materials shall be so selected as to withstand the city's climate and the microclimate on the property. Plant materials shall be selected with the advice of city staff. Where practicable, open space on the site shall create a desirable and functional environment for patrons, pedestrians, and occupants. 
(5)  Signage. Signs shall be minimized in number and size, and integrated with architectural and site landscape features. Placement of signs shall not unduly obscure or interfere with sight lines to other properties. Signs shall comply with zoning requirements. 
(6)  Site illumination. Site illumination shall be designed, located and installed so as to minimize adverse impact on adjacent streets and properties, provide for security, and enhance the overall quality of the development. 
(7)  Historical preservation. Preservation of unique historic or architectural landmarks is encouraged. Development designs that respect desirable architectural resources on surrounding sites are also encouraged. 
(8)  Building design. All buildings shall have finished construction on all sides; any roof treatments or parapets shall extend completely around the building; and all rooftop equipment shall be screened. 
(Ord. No. 31-90, pt. 1, 9-18-90)  
Sec. 114-643. - Amendments to plan. 
Amendments to an approved access corridor development plan shall require approval in the same manner required for the original development plan. 
(Ord. No. 31-90, pt. 1, 9-18-90)  
Sec. 114-644. - Time limit on plan approval. 
No development plan approval under this article shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date of approval unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period. Time extensions may be provided by the director of city development provided the applicant demonstrates that there are circumstances, difficulties or practical hardships which make compliance with the original one-year approval period unreasonable.

DIVISION 2. - FD FLEX DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT 
 
Sec. 114-645. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Over time, the use for which a property was developed may become obsolete due to economic, demographic, or technological change. The property, including structures, site improvements, and infrastructure, may have redevelopment potential for alternative use or uses. Flexible zoning regulations can facilitate the redevelopment of such properties, thereby minimizing vacancy and abandonment of property, promoting environmentally sound reuse of structures and infrastructure, and protecting surrounding property from adverse effects of new uses of the property that could occur if unregulated. 
(b)  The flexible development overlay district is intended to permit redevelopment of property in circumstances in which a property, including its structures, site improvements and infrastructure, is suitable for reuse but the reuse is not consistent with the underlying zoning district, rezoning to another classification would permit other uses potentially detrimental to surrounding properties, and any potentially adverse effects of the intended reuse can be mitigated by conditions on the reuse. 
(Ord. No. 5-06, pt. 4, 2-23-06)  
Sec. 114-646. - Permitted uses, conditional uses and other uses. 
(a)  Uses in a flex development may at times not coincide with those anticipated within the underlying zoning district. However, uses in a flex development shall be compatible with existing, proposed and anticipated uses, and shall not be a detriment, a nuisance or injurious to other permitted uses or properties in the area. 
(b)  Any permitted use and conditional use as permitted in the underlying zoning district is permitted in the flex development overlay district unless expressly prohibited by the use supplement. 
(c)  Other uses may be permitted in accordance with those contained in the use supplement as developed by the chief building inspector, in consultation with the director of city development, and submitted to the planning, heritage, and design commission and common council. A use supplement adopted by resolution of the common council shall list all those additional uses which, when applying good and reasonable judgment, are determined to not be detrimental to the subject, adjacent and area properties. 
(d)  Minor and major changes to the use supplement shall be permitted as follows: minor changes may be approved by the chief building inspector but in consultation with the director of city development, and major changes shall require approval of the common council in accordance with section 114-648. 
(Ord. No. 5-06, pt. 4, 2-23-06; Ord. No. 0026-19, pt. 89, 11-12-19)  
Sec. 114-647. - Standards. 
The planning, heritage, and design commission shall not recommend approval of a use supplement and the permitted uses contained therein unless the planning, heritage, and design commission finds that: 
(a)  The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the uses will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare; 
(b)  The uses will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood; 
(c)  The establishment of the uses will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the underlying district; 
(d)  Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided; 
(e)  Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in public streets; 
(f)  The proposed uses will neither have an adverse impact nor set an undesirable precedence with relation to the objectives of the current land use plan for the area or the city; 
(g)  Adequate conditions have been included in the use supplement that advance the goals of the preceding standards.

The property owner shall be responsible for the cost of all private storm sewer lines including the connection to the public storm sewer system. 
Sites, which include less than 10,000 square feet of total impervious surface, may not necessarily be required to convey the storm water drainage to the public storm sewer system. However, where the overland drainage causes a public nuisance, the city may require a direct connection to the public storm sewer system. 
The City of Racine shall require an erosion and sediment control plan in accordance with Chapter 98, Article VI, which shall be available for all site drainage plans, submitted for approval. 
The City of Racine may require a post construction stormwater management plan in accordance with Chapter 98, Article VII, which shall be available for all site plans, submitted for approval.

(b)  The design guidelines expressed in this division shall apply to all facilities such as, but not limited to, office, commercial, residential facilities containing five or more living units, lodging, museum, theater, governmental, parking and utility. All facilities, regardless of type, must be designed with the following considerations. 
(1)  Context. The facility is designed in a manner that is mindful of and complementary to the existing building and natural environment. The facility should strengthen and enhance the characteristics of the setting, or at least maintain key unifying architectural or natural patterns. Existing facilities need not be mirrored in every aspect, but rather used as a starting point in the development of a design. 
(2)  Harmony. The facility utilizes materials, forms and colors that serve as unifying elements with the surrounding built and natural environment. Such uniformity is not intended to inhibit creativity, innovation and individuality in the overall design of a facility. 
(3)  Conformance. The facility does not detract from those architectural details found to be most successful and prominent in historical and landmark downtown area structures. 
(4)  Linkages. The facility reflects the individuality of the specific area or district in which it is located and, if reasonably possible, articulates identifiable architectural patterns. 
(5)  Compatibility. The facility should be compatible with nearby buildings' architectural scale, color, rhythm and proportions. 
(6)  Historical integrity. The facility respects the unique historical context of the downtown area. Rehabilitation, remodeling and addition projects shall retain, wherever practicable, the original structure's character, scale and composition. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship shall be retained and preserved wherever practicable. 
(7)  View opportunities. The facility is sensitive to new and existing opportunities with which to observe and enjoy surrounding points of interest and activity. 
(8)  Quality. The facility incorporates materials and design features that convey permanence, durability and quality. 
(9)  Environmental sensitivity. The facility should incorporate materials, construction techniques, systems and design methods that increase energy efficiency. Use of salvaged materials or reuse of existing materials is encouraged when appropriate. Materials should be used that are not harmful to the environment, not only during their use in the facility but also in their production. 
(c)  Planned developments as defined in article III, division 3, of this chapter shall not require review under article VII, division 12 of this chapter.

Sec. 114-829. - Evaluation criteria. 
The following design guidelines evaluation criteria shall be used to determine if a proposed activity fulfills the objectives of this division: 
(1)  Traffic circulation. All vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems shall provide adequate and reasonably safe access through the downtown, and should promote a pedestrian friendly environment. 
(2)  Environmental design. All projects shall incorporate sustainable environmental design, processes and practices when possible or practical. 
(3)  Site layout and building arrangement. 
a.  The layout, mass, orientation and height of the structures on the site, including areas for use by motorized vehicles for circulation, parking and storage, should allow for appropriate use of the proposed development in light of surrounding uses, traffic patterns, pedestrian facilities, neighboring and opposite structures, and topography. The arrangement of structures on the site shall also be evaluated for their potential impact on the provision of city services, such as access for emergency vehicles. 
b.  The setback of structures shall conform to those of the underlying zoning district unless the following criteria provide a greater distance: 
1.  From surface water (OHWM), floodway, or 100-year floodplain: 60 feet from the mapped or surveyed limits. 
2.  From open drainage channels: 25 feet from the OHWM if documentable, or from the centerline of the channel if not documented. 
3.  From slopes exceeding 12 percent: 25 feet from the top of the slope, and from the bottom of the slope. 
4.  From a designated habitat area: 25 feet. 
5.  From a primary environmental corridor, secondary environmental corridor, isolated natural feature, as identified by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, as recognized or modified by the City of Racine: 25 feet. 
6.  Reductions of the setbacks listed in 1—5 above may be approved through the conditional use process, if environmental protection objectives are accomplished to the same or greater degree. 
(4)  Project design. All projects shall be designed with attention and sensitivity to the historical, architectural, and physical context in which they are, or are to be located. Special attention should be paid to the sidewalk level of buildings through the creation of pedestrian orientated details. Project design considerations are as follows: 
a.  General requirements are that all buildings should have a unified design treatment; and finished construction on all sides; facades facing the river shall be considered in design and function as if a street facade; any roof treatments or parapets shall extend completely around the building; and all rooftop equipment shall be screened from view. 
(5)  Parking and loading layout. Proposed parking and truck loading facilities shall be designed, located and screened to minimize adverse visual impact on adjacent properties. 
(6)  Landscaping. Landscaping design should enhance the overall appearance of the downtown area, create a logical transition to adjacent development, screen incompatible structures and uses, and minimize the visual impact of parking facilities on adjacent sites and roadways. Plant materials shall be selected so as to withstand the city's climate and the microclimate on the property. 
(7)  Signage. Signs should be minimal in number and size. Placement of signs shall not unduly obscure or interfere with sight lines to other properties. Signs should be architecturally compatible and contribute to the historic character of the area through the incorporation of tasteful presentations utilizing appropriate logos, symbols, graphics and/or text. Free-standing signs should incorporate architectural features or materials of the buildings or facilities they are intended to promote. Signs shall comply with all zoning requirements. 
(8)  Site illumination. Site illumination shall be designed, located and installed so as to minimize adverse impacts on adjacent streets and properties, provide security, and enhance the overall quality of the development. Some site illumination design considerations are as follows: 
a.  Exterior building lighting may be used to articulate a particular building design or accentuate an outstanding architectural feature. Neon silhouette accent lighting, bulb or flashing lighting, or fluorescent lighting is inappropriate. 
b.  Parking lot and walkway lighting should relate a pedestrian scale and be sensitive to the historic atmosphere of the downtown area. 
(9)  Historic preservation. Preservation of unique historic or architectural landmarks is encouraged. Development designs that do not detract from desirable architectural resources on surrounding sites are also encouraged. 
(10)  Modifications to criteria. The above criteria may be modified by provisions of the flex development overlay, a planned development conditional use permit, or by administrative discretion as may be afforded by this chapter.

(f)  Noise. All small wireless facilities shall comply with the following decibel requirements. 
(1)  Generate no more than 45 decibels within three feet of any residential dwelling or city park boundary. 
(2)  All other locations shall generate no more than 55 decibels. 
(g)  Adverse effects on adjacent properties. The permit holder shall undertake all reasonable efforts to avoid undue effects upon adjacent properties and/or property uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance, modification, or removal of the facility. 
(h)  Maintenance. 
(1)  The facility and any associated structures shall be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans and conditions. 
(2)  All graffiti on facilities shall be removed at the sole expense of the permit holder within 48 hours after notification to the permit holder from the city. 
(i)  Record retention. The permit holder shall retain full and complete copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the facility, which includes without limitation all conditions of approval, approved plans, resolutions, and other documentation associated with the permit or regulatory approval. In the event the city cannot locate any such full and complete permits or other regulatory approvals in its official records, and the permit holder fails to retain full and complete records in the permit holder's files, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an examination of the missing documents will be conclusively resolved against the permit holder.

(3)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, facilities of a permit holder that, for one year, remain unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. In addition to any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, the city may, at its option: 
a.  Abate the nuisance and recover the cost from the permit holder or the permit holder's successor in interest; 
b.  Take possession of the facilities; and/or 
c.  Require removal of the facilities by the permit holder or the permit holder's successor in interest. 
(4)  Upon removal or relocation of a facility, the permit holder shall restore the right-of-way to its prior condition in accordance with City of Racine specifications. However, a support structure owned by another entity authorized to maintain that support structure in the right-of-way need not be removed but must instead be restored to its prior condition. If the permit holder fails to make the restorations herein required, the city at its option may do such work. In that event, the permit holder shall pay to city, within 30 days of billing therefor, the cost of restoring the right-of-way.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, TITLE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 114-841. - Statutory authorization. 
This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. § 62.23 and the requirements in Wis. Stats. § 87.30. 
(Ord. No. 38-06, pt. 1, 12-5-06)  
Sec. 114-842. - Finding of fact. 
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of the city would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(Ord. No. 38-06, pt. 1, 12-5-06)

(Ord. No. 38-06, pt. 1, 12-5-06)  
Sec. 114-844. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Racine, Wisconsin. 
(Ord. No. 38-06, pt. 1, 12-5-06)  
Sec. 114-845. - General provisions. 
(1)  Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. 
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-zones on the flood insurance rate map. 
(2)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Racine Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the flood insurance study (FIS) or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Natural Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the zoning administrator. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
Official maps: Based on the FIS. 
(a)  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panels 55101C0111D, 55101C0113E, 55101C0114D, 5101C0118D, 55101C0119D, 55101C0209D, 55101C0226E, 55101C0227D, 55101C0228D, 55101C0229D, 55101C0231D, 55101C0232D, 55101C0233D, 55101C0234D, 55101C0236D, 55101C0237D, and 55101C0241D, dated May 2, 2012; with corresponding profiles that are based on the flood insurance study (FIS) dated May 2, 2012, volume numbers 55101CV001A and 55101CV002A. 
Approved by: DNR and FEMA 
Official maps: Based on other studies. 
(a)  The boundaries of the floodplains in the city are hereby established as shown upon the official floodplain and floodway maps, dated September 1972, December 1972, January 1973, July 1973, August 1973, April 1973, May 1974, and November 1977 (floodlines taken from the Root River watershed topographic maps as copyrighted by Racine County which were prepared by Alster and Associates Engineers, Inc. and the Southeastern Regional Planning Commission), which are based on the flood insurance study maps and corresponding profiles dated September 1972, including flood insurance rate maps as revised January 2, 1976. The floodlines along Root River at the Racine Country Club have been modified as shown on the engineering studies by Foth and Van Dyke Engineers, dated June 25, 1993, and as shown on the map modifications dated October 4, 1993. 
Approved by: DNR and FEMA 
(b)  The boundaries of the floodplain for the Pike River in the city between 16th Street and the abandoned C.M.St. P & P Railroad right-of-way east of Oakes Road are shown on the map dated July 29, 1993. 
Approved by: DNR and FEMA 
(3)  Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
(a)  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
(b)  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
(c)  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
(4)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsections (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to division 8. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 114-903(3) and the criteria in [subsections] (a) and (b) below. 
(a)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(b)  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the department. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to section 114-910(6). 
(5)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to division 8. 
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC). 
(6)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be in compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(7)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies. 
(8)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(a)  This article supersedes all the provisions of any zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23 or § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. If another section is more restrictive than this article, that section shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
(9)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the city and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this article, required by Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this article or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article. 
(10)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this article create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
(11)  Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected. 
(12)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Racine County floodplain zoning provisions, or other governmental unit's duly adopted floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116, and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions or other governmental unit's duly adopted floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
(13)  General development standards. The city shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this article.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 114-1026. - Purpose, scope of article; compliance required. 
Purpose. Exterior signing has a clear impact on the character and quality of the city. As a prominent part of the urban environment, signs may attract or repel the viewing public, affect the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and help set the tone and legibility of the neighborhood and the city. This sign ordinance establishes minimum standards to promote life, health, safety, welfare, convenience, and enjoyment of the public by regulating the design, quality of materials, construction, location, quantity, electrification and maintenance of all signs, bulletin boards, and advertising devices visible from public rights of way. The purpose of this sign ordinance is to allow adequate communication through signage while ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic properties, convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the validity of the remaining sections shall not be affected. 
(1)  Permit required. The regulations set forth in this article shall apply to and govern signs in all districts. No sign regulated by this article shall be erected until a permit for the erection of such sign has been issued by the city zoning administrator, unless otherwise permitted or regulated in this article. No sign shall be erected or maintained unless it is in compliance with the regulations governing location and bulk of structures for the district in which it is located, unless such sign is otherwise specifically regulated by conditional use provisions or provisions relating to variances. 
a.  Application for permit and appeal. A completed application for a sign permit along with the permit fee as listed in the schedule of fees must be filed with the city zoning administrator using the form provided. The city zoning administrator must process the application within 10 days and either approve an application that complies with all relevant provisions of the code or deny the application and give sufficient reasons for the denial. If the zoning administrator denies the application, the applicant may file a written appeal within 10 days of the denial to the zoning board of appeals under section 114-903, which shall either affirm or reverse the decision of the zoning administrator. A written appeal under this subsection shall be deemed incomplete and will not be reviewed if it is not accompanied by the applicable fee as listed in the schedule of fees. 
b.  Duration and revocation of permit. If a sign is not installed within six months following the issuance of a sign permit (or within 30 days of a temporary sign permit), the permit shall be void. The city zoning administrator may revoke a sign permit if it determines that the information in the application was materially false or misleading, the sign as installed does not conform to the sign permit application, the sign violates any provisions in the Code of Ordinances, or the sign is not being properly maintained or has been abandoned. 
c.  Any person who may be adversely impacted by any regulations set forth in this article may apply for a variance pursuant to the procedures outlined in section 114-903 of the code. For signs requiring a conditional use permit, exceptions to the code may be granted pursuant to the procedures and standards outlined in article III of this chapter. 
(2)  Nonconformity and modification. Any sign lawfully in existence on the date the provisions of this article were first adopted, which do not conform to the provisions of this article now but were in compliance with the applicable regulations at the time they were constructed, erected or affixed must be regarded as nonconforming. Provided, however, a sign constructed during the period of time following June 18, 2015, and the date the provisions of this article were first advertised for adoption must not be considered a nonconforming sign unless it conformed to the regulations in effect on the day immediately preceding June 18, 2015. Signs which were unlawful under the prior ordinance and which do not conform to this article must be removed immediately. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article or of related standards referenced in this article, applications will be reviewed only with respect to sign structure, placement, time, place, and manner; administration of the article shall be done without regard to content or message of the sign.

Sec. 114-1038. - Window signage. 
(a)  Window signage shall be permitted as follows: 
(1)  Allowance of window signage is over and above signage allocated for any building (such as wall, freestanding pole, monument, etc.). Window signage shall not count against allowable square footage for permanent signage; therefore, a window sign permit is not required. 
(2)  All signage shall be maintained in good repair by the property owner. Damaged, faded torn, burnt-out, and unkempt signage is not allowed. 
(3)  Reciprocal signs: an owner of a business property may themselves, or give permission for a tenant, to enter into reciprocal product or service agreements with other businesses to host window signage advertising a guest businesses name, goods or services not offered by the host business. As a hypothetical, "Tom's Gas and Snacks" on Douglas Avenue enters into an agreement with "Gold Touch Brakes and Mufflers" on Green Bay Road to display a window sign announcing "Buy $30 of snacks at Tom's and get a free brake system analysis at Gold Touch." For the purpose of this article, reciprocal signs as permitted in this section shall not be considered off-premises signs as defined in subsection 114-1(b) or as regulated by division 3 of this article. 
(4)  No window sign shall advertise any use or substance considered to be unlawful or illegal per the City of Racine Code of Ordinances, state statutes, or federal regulations. 
(5)  Neon colored paint, use of markers, paper, hand-drawn lettering, etc., are not to be used in the creation of a window signs. 
(6)  Window signage may be illuminated; however, the window signage shall not blink, flash, scroll, or produce any other movement, or have the appearance of movement. 
(7)  A seasonal business, as defined in subsection 114-1(b) of this chapter, operating at their current location prior to August 19, 2014, shall be exempt from compliance with section 114-1038. 
(b)  Location. 
(1)  Any sign attached to the interior of a window or attached to a product or other device located within six feet of the interior of a window shall be considered window signage. This includes displays, cardboard, advertisements, banners, flags, and the like. 
(2)  Window signage shall not be placed in view of a residential use or residentially zoned property unless authorized by the plan[ning] commission. 
(c)  Measuring and allowable signage. 
(1)  No more than an aggregate area equaling 50 percent of all street level street facade windows may be covered by window signage. 
(2)  A window section is the area of a window divided by a window frame, architectural feature, or the point where an interior tenant wall separates the interior space of a building. If there is no separation, the window section is the entire window. 
(3)  To calculate the amount of window signage allowed, measure the area of all the street level street facade window sections and multiply by 0.50. This calculation will provide the amount of window signage allowed. (For example: two street level street facade windows measuring ten feet by ten feet would equal 200 square feet of window area. Multiply 200 by 0.50, and the allowed window signage could total up to 100 square feet. This amount of signage may be applied to both windows, or one window, as long as the total amount of window signage does not exceed 100 square feet).

DIVISION 2. - OFF-STREET PARKING  
Subdivision I. - Generally 
 
Sec. 114-1146. - Exemption. 
When the application of the off-street parking provisions specified in this division results in a requirement of not more than three spaces on a single zoning lot in any business or industrial district, such parking spaces need not be provided; however, where two or more uses are located on a single zoning lot, only one of those uses shall be eligible for the above exemption. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(1))  
Sec. 114-1147. - Central area parking regulations. 
In the B4 central business district, for the purpose of minimizing disruptive curb cuts and driveways and to encourage the consolidation of parking space in appropriate locations, accessory off-street parking is not required. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(2))  
Sec. 114-1148. - Location. 
(a)  All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses erected or established after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives shall be located on the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that parking spaces to serve business or industrial buildings or uses may be located within 500 feet of such use if such spaces are located in a business or industrial district. Buildings or uses existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives which are subsequently altered or enlarged so as to require the provision of parking spaces under this article may be served by parking facilities located on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, provided such facilities are within 500 feet walking distance of a main entrance to the use served. Owners of property, nonconforming as to parking, who elect to provide parking and become conforming may locate such parking on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use is located, as allowed in this division. 
(b)  Off-street parking spaces open to the sky may be located in any yard except the required front yard or corner side yard in a residential, restricted office, office/institutional, or industrial district, except that in a residential district, automobile parking is permitted in the required front yard or corner side yard provided the following conditions are met: 
(1)  Automobiles shall be parked on a driveway as specified in section 114-1167, provided all portions of the driveway lead directly to a garage or parking space located outside the required front or corner side yard. Parked vehicles shall not project beyond the property lines. This subsection shall not apply to a circular drive as defined in subsection 114-1(2). 
(2)  In the case of an attached garage, a parking space may be created adjacent to the driveway, not to exceed 20 feet in width. This space shall be surfaced as specified in section 114-1167 and shall not be located directly in front of the residence. Parked vehicles shall not project beyond the property lines. 
(3)  No vehicular vision clearance area shall be obstructed by a motor vehicle. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(3); Ord. No. 19-99, pt. 2, 1-18-00; Ord. No. 5-01, pt. 2, 2-21-01)  
Sec. 114-1149. - Control of off-site parking facilities. 
All off-site parking facilities, except those which are conditional uses or parts of conditional uses, shall be subject to the approval of the zoning board of appeals. In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or long-term lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the zoning board of appeals; and such deed or lease shall be filed with the zoning administrator. The deed or lease shall require such owner or his heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(4))  
Sec. 114-1150. - Size of parking spaces. 
(a)  Except for parallel parking spaces, each required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and at least 19 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office or work areas. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet, and shall be measured at right angles to the axis of the vehicle. For parallel parking, the length of the parking space shall be increased to 24 feet. All other requirements as to size shall be as set forth in the off-street parking chart included in this division. 
(b)  To allow for conversion of parking to small car parking spaces in the future, the following alternative to the size requirements set forth in the off-street parking chart of this division may be used. Parking facilities may be designed with a 50-foot modular width, which will accommodate two rows of parked cars and the intervening central access aisle (wall to wall dimension). This 50-foot modular width will allow nine-foot-wide, 50-degree angle parking spaces for standard size cars and 7½-foot wide, 75-degree angle parking spaces for small cars. A maximum of ten percent of the parking spaces required by this subsection may be striped for small cars, provided that these spaces are conveniently located and suitably controlled for use by only small cars. The location and control of small car parking spaces shall be approved by the zoning administrator. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(5))  
Sec. 114-1151. - Access. 
Except on residential lots, each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway at least 12 feet wide or such additional width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movement. In any event, all driveways shall conform to all applicable driveway specifications adopted by the city. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(6))  
Sec. 114-1152. - Collective facilities for separate uses. 
(a)  Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served. Further, no parking space or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized by the zoning board of appeals. 
(b)  In business areas where a portion of the available parking is being provided in municipal parking lots (not including the B-4 central business zoning district), new or expanding uses located within 500 feet of a municipal parking lot shall provide required parking, or in instances where poor lot layout, existing development, etc., make the provision of required parking difficult, such new or expanding uses may apply for a conditional use permit for counting a portion of parking in the municipal parking lot as required parking. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(7))  
Sec. 114-1153. - Computation of fractional spaces. 
When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one parking space. Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(8))  
Sec. 114-1154. - Utilization. 
Except as may otherwise be provided for the parking of trucks in the granting of conditional uses, required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed in this division shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants, or employees of such uses.

Sec. 114-1167. - Character; surfacing. 
(a)  Accessory parking spaces may be open to the sky, or enclosed in a building. 
(b)  All open off-street parking areas and driveways shall, at a minimum, be surfaced with two inches of asphalt pavement over a crushed stone base. Parking areas and driveways not in compliance as of the effective date of the ordinance adopting the requirement may remain in noncompliance, excepting if eroding of soils, tracking of sediment and debris, or airborne dust resulting from the noncomplying parking area or driveway creates a nuisance to the general public as determined by the chief building inspector, then the surfacing requirement shall apply. Appeal of such determination shall be to the zoning board of appeals. 
(c)  The ingress and egress of vehicles from an off-street parking area or driveway shall not result in the tracking of mud or debris onto sidewalks or streets, and proper drainage shall be provided. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(10)b, c; Ord. No. 19-99, pt. 3, 1-18-00; Ord. No. 25-03, pt. 1, 11-18-03)  
Sec. 114-1168. - Screening and landscaping.

Sec. 114-1169. - Lighting. 
Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be aimed directly away from residential properties and public streets in such a way as not to create a nuisance. However, in no case shall such lighting exceed three footcandles measured at the lot line. Loudspeaker systems are not permitted.

Sec. 114-1171. - Wheel stops. 
All parking lots shall be provided with wheel stops or bumper guards so located on the periphery of parking lots that no part of parked vehicles shall extend beyond the property line. Such stops or guards shall be properly anchored or secured. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(a)(10)g)

Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the specific parking classes as set forth in the off-street parking table (parking classes), except within the B4 central business district. Parking spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated within a parking class shall be assumed to be included in the principal (permitted or conditional) use requirement. If, for any reason, the classification of any use, for the purpose of determining the amount of off-street parking or the number of spaces to be provided by such use, is not readily determinable hereunder, the parking class of such use shall be fixed by the zoning administrator. 
(Code 1973, § 16.11.020(b))
