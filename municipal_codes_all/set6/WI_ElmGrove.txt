compel the production of all books, inventories, appraisals,

property.

The Board shall presume that the Assessor's valuation is correct. The
objector may rebut that presumption by sufficiently showing that the
valuation is incorrect.
A. Correction of assessments. From the evidence before it, the Board shall
determine whether the Assessor's assessment is correct. If the
assessment is too high or too low, the Board shall raise or lower the
assessment accordingly and shall state on the record the correct
assessment and that the assessment is reasonable in light of all of the
relevant evidence that the Board received. In the event of a tie vote, the
Assessor's assessment shall be sustained.

Board or to the Assessor.
(2) Fix the day, hour and place at which such matter will be heard.
(3) Subpoena witnesses, except objectors who may testify by
telephone, as it deems necessary to testify concerning the value of
such property. The expense incurred shall be a charge against the
municipality.

C. Notice of decision. Prior to final adjournment, the Board shall provide
the objector, or the appropriate party, notice by personal delivery or by
mail, return receipt required, of the amount of the assessment as

legal custodian who shall make determinations with respect to requests
for access to records as follows:
(1) Each deputy legal custodian may, without prior consent of the legal
custodian, permit access to public records within his/her control,
custody and expertise provided he/she determines that such
records can be accessed by the public.
(2) Each deputy legal custodian who determines that access to a
particular public record should not be granted shall make a
recommendation to the legal custodian communicating the
demonstrative reasons for the need to restrict access. Thereafter, it
shall be the responsibility of the legal custodian to accept or reject
such advice. Upon making a final determination, the legal
custodian shall communicate his/her determination to the
requester in accordance with § 19.35(4), Wis. Stats.
(3) In making the final determination, the legal custodian may inspect
the records being sought and shall receive all assistance and advice
as may be required from any Village employee or agent in the
process of formulating a determination as to a request for access to
records.
(4) In the event that the Village Manager is unavailable as provided in
Subsection A above, the deputy legal custodian shall perform the
duties of the legal custodian as required by this article, except that
no internal recommendation to another party is required as
provided in Subsection E(2) since in such cases the deputy legal
custodian makes the determination as to access.
A. Records will be available for inspection and copying during all Village
Hall business hours (9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.).
B. The legal custodian may, in his/her discretion, require supervision
during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the
manner of access to records.
C. A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of copying records
as follows:
§ 65-2 ELM GROVE CODE § 65-3
54:54
§ 65-4. Requests for records.
(1) The cost of copying shall be as follows:
(a) Public records: $0.25 per page. [Amended 12-18-2007]
(b) Photographs: actual full cost, plus cost of delivery and pickup if
commercially reproduced. [Amended 12-11-2000]
(2) If the form of a record does not permit copying, the actual and
necessary cost of photographing and photographic processing shall
be charged.
(3) The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in
printed form on paper, such us films, computer printouts and audio
or video tapes, shall be charged.
(4) If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also
be charged.
(5) There shall be no charge for locating requested records unless the
actual cost therefor exceeds $50, in which case the cost shall be
estimated by the legal custodian and collected in advance from the
requester. The legal custodian shall have discretion to construe to a
series, scheme or pattern of requests for records made in the form
of individual requests as if only one request for records had been
made for purposes of calculating the locating costs. Multiple
requests for records may be treated as a singular request, provided
the legal custodian can reasonably demonstrate a substantial
degree of similarity among the requests with respect to subject
matter, timing of the requests, continuity of the requests, source of
the request and focus of the requests.
(6) The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and
may require a cash deposit adequate to assure payment, if such
estimate exceeds $5. No charges will be assessed for any request
under $3. [Amended 12-18-2007]
D. There shall be posted in the lobby of the Village Hall a notice which
shall list:
(1) The name of the legal custodian.
(2) The names of the deputy legal custodians and general description
of records under their control.
(3) A listing of inspection hours.
(4) A fee schedule for copies of records.
A. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal
custodian or deputy legal custodian. A request for a record without a
reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented
§ 65-3 OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES § 65-4
54:55
§ 65-5. Limitations on right to access.
by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A requester
may be required to show acceptable identification whenever security
reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
B. The legal custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as
practicable, either fill the request or notify the requester of the
determination by the legal custodian to deny the request in whole or in
part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian determines that a
written request is so general as to be unduly time-consuming, the party
making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request
in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 65-5. Every
written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request
for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to
review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under § 19.37(1), Wis.
Stats., or upon application to the Attorney General or the District
Attorney.
A. As provided by § 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt
from inspection under this section:
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal
law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law
enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require
exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a
condition to receipt of aids by the State of Wisconsin;
(3) Computer programs, although the material used as input for a
computer program or the material produced as a product of the
computer program is subject to inspection; and
(4) A record or any portion of a record containing information
qualifying as a common law trade secret.
(5) Access to or copies of plans and/or construction documents of any
Village-owned or-leased structure, including fixtures and
structures relating to municipal water, storm surface water,
sanitary sewer facilities, public utilities, including gas pipelines,
petroleum lines, transformer box substations, communication
fixtures and facilities, and all buildings over 40,000 square feet are
not subject to open record in order to protect public safety. [Added
12-18-2007]
B. As provided by § 43.30, Wis. Stats., Village public library circulation
records are exempt from inspection under this section.
§ 65-4 ELM GROVE CODE § 65-5
54:56
C. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is
not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after
consultation with the deputy legal custodian as provided in § 65-2E(2)
above and with the Village Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or
in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest
resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full
access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which
disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which
were necessary and given in order to obtain the information
contained in them.
(2) Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.
(3) Records of current deliberations concerning employment,
dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or
discipline of any Village officer or employee or the investigation of
charges against a Village officer or employee.
(4) Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or
prevention.
(5) Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of
Village property, investing of Village funds or other Village business
whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require
nondisclosure.
(6) Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data
of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a
substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person
referred to in such history or data.
(7) Communications between legal counsel for the Village and any
officer, agent or employee of the Village when advice is being
rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in
which the Village or any of its officers, agents or employees is, or is
likely to become, involved or communications which are privileged
under § 905.03, Wis. Stats.
D. If a record contains information that may be made public and
information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record
shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the
information that may not be made public from the record for release. If
in the judgment of the custodian there is no feasible way to separate the
exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably
jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record
shall be withheld from disclosure.
§ 65-5 OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES § 65-6

§ 65-6. Records retention.
Unless otherwise provided by law, the provisions of Article II of this chapter
shall control maintenance and the destruction of public records.
§ 65-6 ELM GROVE CODE § 65-6
54:58
ARTICLE II
Retention and Destruction
[Adopted 2-12-1996]
§ 65-7. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish a Village records retention
schedule and authorize destruction of Village records pursuant to the
schedule on an annual basis. Records custodians do not have the authority
to destroy records prior to the established retention period unless such
records have been photographically reproduced as original records
pursuant to § 16.61(7), Wis. Stats., and under this article.
§ 65-8. Historical records.
The State Historical Society of Wisconsin (SHSW) has waived the required
sixty-day statutory notice under § 19.21(5)(d), Wis. Stats., for the records
in § 65-12 of this article marked "W" which designates "waived notice."
The SHSW must be notified prior to destruction of records marked "N"
designating nonwaiver. "N/A" indicates "not applicable" and applies to all
records designated for permanent retention. Notice to the SHSW is also
required for any other record not specifically listed in this article.
§ 65-9. Microfilming or optical disk storage.
Village records may be kept and preserved on microfilm or optical disk
provided the applicable standards established in § 16.61(7), Wis. Stats., are
met. Factors such as retention periods and estimated costs and benefits
of converting records between different medias should be considered in
deciding whether or not to preserve on microfilm or optical disk. The
retention periods identified in this article apply to records in any media.
§ 65-10. Destruction after request for inspection.
Where a request for inspection of public records has been made under
Wisconsin's Public Records Law (§§ 19.31 to 19.37, Wis. Stats.), no
requested record may be destroyed until after the request is granted or
for 60 days after the request is denied. If an action is commenced under
§ 19.37, Wis. Stats., the requested record may not be destroyed until a court
order is issued and all appeals have been completed.
§ 65-11. Destruction during litigation.
No record known to be the subject of litigation shall be destroyed until the
litigation has been resolved.
§ 65-12. Retention schedule. [Amended 12-18-2007]
A. The following records shall be maintained for the periods indicated.

request in his/her place. When a member participates by audio

senior member of the committee may consent to the request in
his/her place. When a committee member is allowed to

Emergency medical services  See Ch. 137.
§ 91-1. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to regulate alarm systems as defined in this
chapter in the Village of Elm Grove and to prevent carelessness, improper
maintenance or any other cause which results in false police and/or fire
and/or emergency medical services (EMS) alarms from privately owned,
commercially owned, leased or contracted alarm systems. Such false alarms
initiate police, EMS and/or fire personnel and apparatus responses which
result in unnecessary expenses to the village, increase the risk of damage
to property or injury to persons and dilute the level of police and fire
protection available to other areas of the village.
§ 91-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter the following words will have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM PERMIT  A permit which must be applied for by any person
having control over any property within the Village of Elm Grove at which
there is installed any alarm system. A new permit must be applied for
whenever such system is upgraded or modified in any way with respect to
its operation.
ALARM SYSTEM  An intrusion, fire, burglar, robbery, elevator, or medical
emergency alarm system that is designed or utilized to summon a single or
combined response by the Elm Grove emergency medical services, Police or

emergency medical services of the Village of Elm Grove.
FALSE ALARM  A signal from an alarm system resulting in a response
by one or more of the Elm Grove Police or Fire Department or emergency
medical services when an emergency situation does not exist, regardless of
the manner in which the village is alerted to respond.
§ 91-3. Application for alarm permit.
§ 91-4. Prohibited alarm systems.
A. Any person having control over any property within the Village of Elm

permit shall be issued by the Village Clerk.
(1) Name, address and telephone number of party who can be
contacted in the event of an emergency or false alarm and who is

system.
(2) Identification of party installing the alarm system.
(3) Identification of person or firm that can be contacted by the village
to report any apparent malfunction in the alarm system.
(4) Any other information deemed necessary by the Village Police or
Fire Chief for the purpose of providing an appropriate response.
B. No information required for an application for alarm permits shall be
deemed public information under § 19.31, Wis. Stats., and instead
constitutes information whose disclosure would result in a compromise
of public safety which is not outweighed by the benefit to the public in
disclosure of the same. All information so required shall be maintained
in a secured manner by village personnel upon receipt from the Village
Clerk.
C. There shall be no fee for any application for alarm permit made.
D. Each alarm permit application shall provide notice to the applicant that
the Village of Elm Grove warrants no higher standard of care in

than is available to persons not having such alarm system.

the Police Chief that the false alarm was not the result of negligence, or
improper maintenance, such fee may be waived. [Amended
2-24-2009]
B. Violation of § 91-4A, Audible alarms, and § 91-4B, Automatically
activated phone dialer, shall result in a fine as listed on the Village of
Elm Grove Fee Schedule, as amended from time to time by the Village

punishable according to the fee schedule for alarm violations. A

which elapses without the procurement of a permit.
D. This section shall not be applicable to any publicly owned structure
within the Village.

C. Damage. Within one day after the moved building reaches its
destination, the permittee shall notify the Building Inspector, who shall
instruct the Public Works Director to inspect the route traveled. He or
she shall determine whether any damage has occurred to streets, road
crossings, intersections, trees or shrubs, poles, wire cables or other
equipment belonging to the Village. If any damage has resulted, the
permittee shall, within 10 days, pay to repair the damage following
notice from the Village.
A. The Village Board or the Building Inspector of the Village of Elm Grove
may order the owner of premises upon which is located any building or
part thereof within said Village which, in the Village Board's or Building
Inspector's judgment, is so old or dilapidated or has become so out of
repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for
human habitation, occupancy or use, and so that it would be
unreasonable to repair the same, to raze and remove such building or
part thereof or, if it can be made safe by repairs, to repair and make
safe and sanitary or to raze and remove at the owner's option or, where
there has been a cessation of normal construction of any building or
structure beyond the end of the time period allowed under § 106-3F
herein, to raze and remove such building or part thereof.
(1) The order shall specify a time in which the owner shall comply
therewith and specify repairs, if any. It shall be served on the owner
of record or his or her agent where an agent is in charge of the
building and upon the holder of any encumbrance of record in the
manner provided for service of a summons in the Circuit Court. If

found, the order may be served by posting it on the main entrance
of the building and by posting for 14 days at least 10 days before
the time limit in the order commences to run. [Amended

(2) The owner or contractor razing any building in the Village shall file
a performance bond of not less than $50,000 prior to the issuance
of any such permit.

§ 106-7. Excavations; filling and grading.
B. If the owner shall fail or refuse to comply within the time prescribed,
the Building Inspector shall cause such building or part thereof to be
razed and removed, either through any available public agency or by
contract or arrangement with private persons, or closed if unfit for
human habitation, occupancy or use. The cost of such razing and
removal or closing shall be charged against the real estate upon which
such building is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate and
shall be assessed and collected as a special tax. When any building has
been ordered razed and removed under said contract or arrangement
aforesaid, the Building Inspector or the Village Board may sell the
salvage and valuable materials at the highest price obtainable. If the
building or part thereof is unsanitary and unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use and is not in danger of structural collapse, the
Building Inspector shall post a placard on the premises containing the
following words: "This Building Cannot Be Used for Human Habitation,
Occupancy or Use," and it shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to
prohibit the use of the building for human habitation, occupancy or use
until the necessary repairs have been made.
C. If any building ordered razed or made safe and sanitary by repairs
contains personal property or fixtures which will unreasonably interfere
with the razing or repair of the building making necessary the removal,
sale or destruction of such personal property or fixtures, the Building
Inspector may order in writing the removal of such personal property or
fixtures by a certain date. Such order shall be served as provided in
Subsection A. If the personal property or fixtures or both are not
removed by the time specified, the Building Inspector may store the
same or may sell them, or if they have no appreciable value the Building
Inspector may destroy the same. In case the property is stored, the
amount paid for storage shall be a lien against such property and
against the real estate and shall be assessed and collected as a special
tax against the real estate if the real estate is owned by the owner of the
personal property and fixtures. If the property is stored, the owner
thereof, if known, shall be notified of the place of its storage and, if it is
not claimed by the owner, it may be sold at the expiration of six months

which such building was located, such owner shall remove from such
premises any debris or unsightly construction materials resulting from
such razing or demolition within a period of 90 days from the
commencement of such razing or demolition. Accumulations of
unsightly construction materials and debris shall be deemed to be those
which, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, if permitted to continue
to be present on said premises, would cause a substantial depreciation
in the property values in the immediate neighborhood of such premises.

A. The Village of Elm Grove finds that many buildings and surrounding
landscapes having a special character or aesthetic value to the Village
have been demolished without consideration of the feasibility of
preserving and continuing the use of the building and landscape
features. In addition, an increasing number of buildings and
surrounding landscapes may be at risk of loss and destruction although
the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable.
B. The Village of Elm Grove finds that demolition, unless properly and
timely conducted, can present a hazard to public safety and can have a
blighting effect on the neighborhood as well as being unsightly.
A. As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BUILDING  A structure comprised of a foundation, walls and a roof.
COMMENCEMENT OF DEMOLITION  Any work done pursuant to a
permit issued pursuant to this article other than any approved erosion
control.
COMPLETION OF DEMOLITION  Removal of the walls of the first
floor above the foundation of the structure being demolished.
DEMOLITION  The razing and removal of all or substantially all of a
structure. The term "demolition" shall also constitute a land disturbing
construction activity for the purposes of the application of Chapter 325,
Article I, Construction Site Erosion Control.
B. For purposes of § 106-17, the terms "commence construction" and
"commencement of construction" shall mean the completion of, and the
making of a request to the Village for inspection of, the footings for the
structure being constructed.
A. Every residential, nonresidential or mixed occupancy building shall
comply with the provisions of this article, regardless of when the
building was constructed, remodeled or otherwise altered.
B. Continuing compliance requirement after demolition. After the effective
date of this article, should only demolition of a principal structure occur
without the commencement of any new construction as described in
§ 106-17D(2) and F(2), there shall be complete compliance with all
other requirements of this article by any owner of the property, except

§ 106-17 BICYCLES § 106-17
101:121
such costs shall be based either on costs actually incurred by the
Village or on the Village's reasonable estimates of costs to be

of a new application therefor, payment of the permit fee and
establishment of a new site management letter of credit.

subject property and to cause any and all work to be done and actions to
be taken to cure such violation.
(1) The applicant and the owner of the subject property shall be jointly
and severally responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the
Village, including without limitation attorneys' fees and
administrative expenses, in causing such cure. The Village shall

subject property poses, in the determination of the Village, a threat
of any kind to the public health or safety.
I. Village right to complete work. Every permit authorizing demolition of a
dwelling issued pursuant to this article shall be conditioned on the
agreement of the applicant and the owner of the subject property that if
the applicant fails or refuses to complete the work authorized by said
permit in accordance with all plans approved in connection with said
permit, or if said permit has expired or been canceled and the applicant
has failed to secure a new permit to complete the work, or if the
applicant has violated any provision of this article or of any permit
issued or plan approved pursuant to this article and fails and refuses to
cure such violation, then the Village shall have the right, in addition to
all other rights afforded to the Village by law at the Village's option, to
complete such work or to correct any defect or deficiency using the
Village's own forces or contractors hired for that purpose. The Village
shall have the right to draw on the site management letter of credit
provided pursuant to Subsection G of this section or to demand
payment directly from the applicant or the owner for the cost of such
Village work, including without limitation legal fees and administrative
expenses, based either on costs actually incurred by the Village or on

§ 106-20. Preamble; intent.
Property improvements within the Village of Elm Grove reflect the Villages
strong economy and its desirability as a place to live and work. New
construction adds significantly to the value of properties; however, the
Village recognizes that new construction activity can be disruptive if not
properly controlled. It is the intent of this Article to ensure that
construction-related activity, including the maintenance and operation of
construction sites, is safe, compatible with existing development and not
disruptive beyond what is necessary.
§ 106-21. Demolition, construction, renovation and other nongarbage
waste requiring the use of a dumpster.
A. All residential, commercial and industrial sites where demolition,
construction, renovation, clean up or like activity is underway shall
either have a construction dumpster or similar waste receptacle for
depositing all construction waste and related non-garbage trash or
provide for storage of all debris within the subject structure. It shall be
the responsibility of both the property owner and the contractor, if
applicable, to ensure regular servicing of any construction dumpster or
similar waste receptacle.
B. All construction dumpsters and similar waste receptacles shall exhibit a
clear and legible demarcation of owner of the receptacle, contact
information, address and a contact phone number.
C. Construction dumpsters and similar waste receptacles shall be located
on the private property undergoing construction, demolition or
renovation. The location of the construction dumpster shall not block
any exit doors or fire lanes.
D. All project sites shall be free of all loose debris, such as cans, metal,
plastic, paper, scrap lumber, concrete remnants, roof tile and other
materials commonly found on construction-related sites. All dumpsters
or like receptacles shall be emptied in a timely fashion so as to prevent
the overflow of debris or litter.
E. It shall be the responsibility of both the entity that owns the dumpster
or like receptacle and the property owner to ensure safe and legal
placement and maintenance of the receptacles, in accordance with this
section.
F. The Village Manager or his or her authorized designee reserves the
right to address special circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
§ 106-20 BICYCLES § 106-22
101:125
§ 106-22. Duty to promptly remove construction dumpsters and
similar waste receptacles.
It shall be the duty of the property owner of record to provide for the timely
removal of construction dumpsters and similar waste receptacles. Upon
completion of a demolition, construction, renovation or related project, said
owner shall have seven calendar days to remove the construction dumpster
or similar waste receptacle from the project site. Removal of construction
dumpsters or similar waste receptacles shall be done in accordance with
Village Code § 208-4, Construction hours.

§ 116-7. Franchise renewal.
A. Upon adoption of any franchise agreement and execution thereof by the
grantee, the grantee agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions
contained herein.
B. Any grantee also agrees to provide all services specifically set forth in
its letter of application, if any, and to provide cable television service
within the confines of the village, and by its acceptance of the franchise
the grantee specifically grants and agrees that its application is thereby
incorporated by reference and made a part of the franchise. In the
event of a conflict between such proposals and the provisions of this
chapter, that provision which provides the greatest benefit to the
village, in the opinion of the village, shall prevail.
A. Current federal statutory process.
(1) The village may, on its own initiative, during the six-month period
which begins with the 36th month before the franchise expiration,
commence a proceeding which affords the public in the village
appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of identifying
§ 116-3 BICYCLES § 116-7
101:131
the future cable-related community needs and interests and
reviewing the performance of the grantee under the franchise.
If the grantee submits, during such six-month period, a written
renewal notice requesting the commencement of such proceeding,
the village shall commence such proceeding not later than six
months after the date such notice is submitted.
(2) Upon completion of the proceeding under Subsection A(1) above,
the grantee may, on its own initiative or at the request of the
village, submit a proposal for renewal. The village may establish a
date by which such proposal shall be submitted.
(3) Upon submittal by the grantee of a proposal to the village for the
renewal of the franchise, the village shall provide prompt public
notice of such proposal and renew the franchise or issue a
preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed
and, at the request of the grantee or on its own initiative,
commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt
public notice of such proceeding.
(4) The village shall consider in any administrative proceeding
whether:
(a) The grantee has substantially complied with material terms of
the existing franchise and with applicable law;
(b) The quality of the grantee's service, including signal quality,
response to consumer complaints and billing practices, but
without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other
services provided over the system, has been reasonable in the
light of community needs;
(c) The grantee has the financial, legal and technical ability to
provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in the
grantee's proposal; and
(d) The grantee's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cablerelated
community needs and interests, taking into account the
costs of meeting such needs and interests.
(5) In any administrative proceeding described in Subsection A(4), the
grantee shall be afforded adequate notice and the grantee and the
village, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full
participation, including the right to introduce evidence [including
evidence related to issues raised in the proceedings under
Subsection A(4) above], to require the production of evidence and
to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such
proceeding at the expense of the grantee.
(6) At the completion of a proceeding under Subsection A(4), the
village shall issue a written decision granting or denying the
proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding and
§ 116-7 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-7
101:132
transmit a copy of such decision to the grantee. Such decision shall
state the reasons therefor.
(7) Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in
compliance with the procedures set forth above shall be based on
one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors
described at Subsection A(4)(a) through (d) pursuant to the record
of the proceeding under said subsection. The village may not base a
denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the
material terms of the franchise or on events considered under
Subsection A(4)(b) unless the village has provided the grantee with
notice and the opportunity to cure within 30 days, unless an
alternate timetable has been mutually established in writing
between the village and the grantee, or in any case in which it is
documented that the village has waived its right to object.
(8) The grantee may appeal any final decision or failure of the village
to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this
section. The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds
that any action of the village is not in compliance with the
procedural requirements of this section or, in the event of a final
decision of the village denying the renewal proposal, the grantee
has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the village with
respect to each of the factors described in Subsection A(4)(a)
through (d) on which the denial is based is not supported by a
preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the
administrative proceeding.
B. Franchise renewal in the event of change in federal law. A franchise
may be renewed by the village upon application of the grantee pursuant
to the procedure established in this section and in accordance with the
then-applicable law.
(1) At least 24 months prior to the expiration of the franchise, the
grantee shall inform the village in writing of its intent to seek
renewal of the franchise.
(2) The grantee shall submit a proposal for renewal which
demonstrates that:
(a) It has been and continues to be in substantial compliance with
the terms, conditions and limitations of this chapter and its
franchise;
(b) Its system has been installed, constructed, maintained and
operated in accordance with the accepted standards of the
industry and this chapter and its franchise;
(c) It has the legal, technical, financial and other qualifications to
continue to maintain and operate its system and to extend the
same as the state of the art progresses so as to assure its
subscribers high-quality service; and
§ 116-7 BICYCLES § 116-7
101:133
§ 116-8. Police powers.
(d) It has made a good faith effort to provide services and facilities
which accommodate the demonstrated needs of the community
as may be reasonably ascertained by the village.
(3) After giving public notice, the village shall proceed to determine
whether the grantee has satisfactorily performed its obligations
under the franchise. To determine satisfactory performance, the
village shall consider technical developments and performance of
the system, programming other services offered, cost of services
and any other particular requirements set in this chapter. Also, the
village shall consider the grantee's reports made to the village and
the Federal Communication Commission, may require the grantee
to make available specified records, documents and information for
this purpose and may inquire specifically whether the grantee will
supply services sufficient to meet community needs and interests.
Industry performance on a national basis shall also be considered.
Provision shall be made for public comment.
(4) The village shall then prepare any amendments to this chapter that
it believes necessary.
(5) If the village finds the grantee's performance satisfactory and finds
the grantee's technical, legal and financial abilities acceptable and
finds that the grantee's renewal proposal meets the future cablerelated
needs of the village, a new franchise shall be granted
pursuant to this chapter as amended for a period to be determined.
(6) If the grantee is determined by the village to have performed
unsatisfactorily, new applicants may be sought and evaluated, and
a franchise award shall be made by the village according to
franchising procedures adopted by the village.
A. By accepting a franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police power of the village to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public and shall agree to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the village pursuant to such power.
B. Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the village's police powers shall be
resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not
of general application in the jurisdiction, or that applies exclusively to
the grantee or cable television system which contains provisions
inconsistent with this franchise, shall prevail only if upon such exercise
the village finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health,
safety, property or general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law.
§ 116-7 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-9
101:134
§ 116-9. Franchise required.
No cable television system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets,
i.e. rights-of-way, for system installation and maintenance purposes, of the
village or be allowed to operate without a franchise granted under this
chapter.
§ 116-10. Use of grantee facilities.
The village shall have the right, during the life of this franchise, to install
and maintain free of charge upon the poles of the grantee any wire or pole
fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable television system
operations of the grantee. The village shall indemnify and hold harmless the
grantee from any claim that might arise due to or as a result of the village's
use.
§ 116-11. Initial franchise costs. [Amended 4-22-2008]
Costs to be borne by the grantee shall include any requirements or charges
incidental to awarding or enforcing an initial franchise under this chapter
but shall not be limited to all costs of posting of notices prior to any
public meeting provided for pursuant to this franchise and any costs not
covered by application fees incurred by the village in its study, preparation
of proposal documents, evaluation of all applications and examinations of
the applicants' qualifications. An advance deposit of funds for this purpose
may be required by the village.
§ 116-12. Notices.

throughout the term of this franchise, an address for service of notices
by mail. The grantee shall maintain a central office to address any issues
relating to operating under this chapter.
§ 116-13. Performance bond.
A. Within 30 days after the award of a franchise under this chapter, the
initial grantee shall file with the village a performance bond in the
amount of $25,000. This bond shall be maintained throughout the
construction period and until such time as determined by the village,
unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement.
B. If the grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or resolution
governing the franchise or fails to well and truly observe, fulfill and
perform each term and condition of the franchise as it relates to the
conditions relative to the construction of the system, including the
franchise agreement which is incorporated herein by reference, there
shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety
of the bond any damages or loss suffered by the village as a result,
including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost
§ 116-9 BICYCLES § 116-13
101:135
§ 116-14. Liability and insurance.
of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, including the village's
Attorney, and costs, up to the full amount of the bond.
C. The village may, upon completion of construction of the service area
pursuant to the application, waive or reduce the requirement of the
grantee to maintain the bond. However, the village may require a
performance bond to be posted by the grantee for any construction
subsequent to the completion of the initial service areas, in a
reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the village.
D. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the
surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until 30
days after receipt by the village, by registered mail, of a written notice
of such intent to cancel and not to renew." Upon receipt of a thirty-day
notice, this shall be construed as default granting the village the right
to call in the bond.
E. The village, at any time during the term of this chapter, may waive the
grantee's requirement to maintain a performance bond. The invitation
to waive the requirement can be initiated by the village or grantee.
A. The grantee shall maintain and by its acceptance of the franchise
specifically agrees that it will maintain throughout the term of the
franchise liability insurance insuring the village and the grantee in the
minimum amount of:
(1) One million dollars for property damage to any one person;
(2) One million dollars for property damage in any one accident;
(3) One million dollars for personal injury to any one person; and
(4) One million dollars for personal injury in any one accident.
B. The certificate of insurance obtained by the grantee in compliance with
this section is subject to the approval of the Village Attorney, and such
certificate of insurance, along with written evidence of payment of
required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the village
during the term of the franchise and may be changed from time to time
to reflect changing liability limits. The grantee shall immediately advise
the Village Attorney of any litigation that may develop that would affect
this insurance.
C. Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the
village thereunder shall be construed to or limit the liability of the
grantee under any franchise issued hereunder or for damages.
D. All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this franchise shall
contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed
§ 116-13 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-14
101:136
§ 116-15. Indemnification.
that this insurance policy may not be canceled by the surety nor the
intention not to renew be stated by the surety until 30 days after receipt
by the village, by registered mail, of a written notice of such intention
to cancel or not to renew."
A. Disclaimer of liability. The village shall not at any time be liable for
injury or damage occurring to any person or property from any cause
whatsoever arising out of the construction, maintenance, repair, use,
operation, condition or dismantling of the grantee's telecommunication
system and due to the act or omission of any person or entity other than
the village or those persons or entities for whom or which the village is
legally liable as a matter of law.
B. Indemnification. The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense,
indemnify and hold harmless the village, all associated, affiliated, allied

injury, sickness, disease or death to any person or damage to, loss
of or destruction of tangible or intangible property, libel, slander,
invasion of privacy and unauthorized use of any trademark, trade
name, copyright, patent, service mark or any other right of any

grantee, its subcontractors or agents or the grantee's failure to
comply with any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or
regulation.

lien arising out of work, labor, materials or supplies provided or
supplied to the grantee, its contractors or subcontractors for the
installation, construction, operation or maintenance of the cable

violations of the common law or any laws, statutes or regulations of
the State of Wisconsin or United States, including those of the
Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, whether by the
grantee or otherwise, excluding therefrom, however, claims which
are solely based upon and shall arise solely out of information
supplied by the village to the grantee in writing and included in the
offering materials with the express written approval of the village
prior to the offering.
C. Assumption of risk. The grantee undertakes and assumes for its
officers, agents, contractors and subcontractors and employees all risk
of dangerous conditions, if any, on or about any village-owned or
village-controlled property, including public rights-of-way, and the
grantee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnities
against and from any claim asserted or liability imposed upon the
indemnities for personal injury or property damage to any person
arising out of the installation, operation, maintenance or condition of
the cable system or the grantee's failure to comply with any federal,
state or local statute, ordinance or regulation.
D. Defense of indemnities. In the event any action or proceeding shall be
brought against the indemnities by reason of any matter for which the
indemnities are indemnified hereunder, the grantee shall, upon notice
from any of the indemnities, at the grantee's sole cost and expense,
resist and defend the same with legal counsel mutually acceptable to
the Village Attorney of the Village of Elm Grove and the grantee,

litigation by the village's own counsel. The grantee shall pay all
reasonable expenses incurred by the village in defending itself with
regard to any such actions, suits or proceedings. These expenses shall
include all out-of-pocket expenses, such as attorney fees, and shall also
include the reasonable value of any services rendered by or on behalf of

by the village shall be deducted from any recovery which the village
might have against the grantee under the terms of this section.
F. Nonwaiver of statutory limits. Nothing in this agreement is intended to
express or imply a waiver of the statutory provisions, of any kind or

to time by the legislature.

discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on
the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, income or sex. The

and local laws and regulations and all executive and administrative

grantee must make cable television service available to every
dwelling unit within the initial service area.
(a) The grantee must make cable television service available to at
least 20% of the dwelling units within the initial service area
within six months from the date of the award of the franchise.
(b) The grantee must make cable television service available to at
least 50% of the dwelling units within the initial service area
within one year from the date of the award of the franchise.
(2) The grantee, in its application, if any, may propose a timetable of
construction which will make cable television service available in
the initial service area sooner than the above minimum
requirements, in which case said schedule will be made part of the
franchise agreement and will be binding upon the grantee.
(3) Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically
approved by the village, will be considered a violation of this
chapter for which the provisions of either § 116-36 or 116-44 shall
apply, as determined by the village.
(4) In special circumstances, the village can waive one-hundredpercent
completion within the two-year time frame, provided
substantial completion is accomplished within the allotted time
frame, substantial completion construed to be not less than 95%,
and justification for less than 100% must be submitted subject to
the satisfaction of the village.
B. Line extensions.
(1) In areas of the franchise territory not included in the initial service
areas, the grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant
to the following requirements:
(a) No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. The grantee is
hereby authorized to extend the cable system as necessary
within the village. To expedite the process of extending the
cable system into a new subdivision, the village will forward to
the grantee an approved engineering plan of each project.
Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall
commence the design and construction process upon receipt of
the final engineering plan. Upon notification from the village
that the first home in the project has been approved for a
building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three
months to complete the construction/activation process within
the project phase.
(b) The grantee must extend and make cable television service
available to every dwelling unit in all unserved, developing
areas having at least 20 dwelling units planned per street mile,
§ 116-19 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-19
101:140
as measured from the existing system, and shall extend its
system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines.
(c) The grantee must extend and make cable television service
available to any isolated resident outside the initial service
area requesting connection at the standard connection charge,
if the connection to the isolated resident would require no
more than a standard drop line of 175 feet.
(2) Early extension.
(a) In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory
extension of service, the grantee shall provide, upon the
request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate
of the costs required to extend service to the subscriber. The
grantee shall then extend service upon request of the potential
subscriber. The grantee may require advance payment or
assurance of payment satisfactory to the grantee. The amount
paid by subscribers for early extensions shall be
nonrefundable, and in the event the area subsequently reaches
the density required for mandatory extension, such payments
shall be treated as consideration for early extension.
(b) Line extension policy. All residents who request cable
television service in the village not currently serviceable to the
existing cable plant will be forwarded to the grantee's
engineering department. The grantee will prepare a cost
estimate based on the remaining actual construction footage
and the current year's actual cost of materials and labor using
the formula provided in Appendix A of this chapter.
(3) New development underground. In cases of new construction or
property development where utilities are to be placed

grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development and
of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for
the grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults and
laterals to be provided at the grantee's expense. The grantee shall
also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of
trenching and easements required to bring service to the
development shall be borne by the developer or property owner,
except that if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/
or vaults and laterals within five working days of the date the
trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the
developer or property owner, then should the trenches be closed
after the five-day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by
the grantee. Except for the notice of the particular date on which
trenching will be available to the grantee, any notice provided to
the grantee by the village of a preliminary plat request shall satisfy
the requirement of reasonable notice if sent to the local general

that 3% of those gross revenues is paid to the village as a franchise fee
under § 116-26.
(1) The grantee, in its application, may propose a line extension policy
which will result in serving more residents of the village than as

A. Interference with persons and improvements. The grantee's system,
poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and
maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or interfere with
the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable

public ways or interfere with any improvements the village may deem
proper to make or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the
streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property.
B. Restoration to prior condition. In case of any disturbance of pavement,
sidewalk, landscaping, driveway or other surfacing, the grantee shall,
at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the village,
replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping or
surface of any street or alley disturbed in as good condition as before
the work was commenced and in accordance with standards for such
work set by the village.
C. Erection, removal and uses of poles, antennas or wire-holding
structures:
§ 116-20 BICYCLES § 116-21
101:143
(1) No poles, antennas or wire-holding structures shall be erected by
the grantee without prior approval of the village with regard to
location, height, types and any other pertinent aspect. However, no
location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall
be a vested interest, and such poles, antennas or structures shall
be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense
whenever the village determines that the public convenience would
be enhanced thereby.
(2) Where poles, antennas or wire-holding structures already existing
for use in serving the village are available for use by the grantee
but it does not make arrangements for such use, the village may
require the grantee to use such poles and structures if it
determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby
and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and
reasonable.
(3) In the absence of any governing federal or state statute, where the
village or a public utility serving the village desires to make use of
the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee but
agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the village
may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration
and upon such terms as the village shall determine to be just and
reasonable, if the village determines that the use would enhance
the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the
grantee's operations.
D. Relocation of the facilities. If at any time during the period of this
franchise the village shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade of
any street, alley or other public ways, the grantee, upon reasonable
notice by the village, shall remove or relocate as necessary its poles,
wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its
own expense, unless the utilities are compensated, in which case the
grantee shall be similarly compensated.
E. Cooperation with building movers. The grantee shall, on the request of
any person holding a building moving permit issued by the village,
temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings.
The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires
shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall
have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee
shall be given not less than 48 hours' advance notice to arrange for
such temporary wire changes.
F. Tree trimming. The grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any
portion, either above, at or below ground level, of any tree within any
public place without the prior consent of the village. The village shall
have the right to do the trimming requested by the grantee at the cost
of the grantee. Regardless of who performs the work requested by the
grantee, the grantee shall be responsible and shall defend and hold the
village harmless for any and all damages to any tree as a result of

condition throughout the entire franchise period.
B. Upon the reasonable request for service by any person located within
the franchise territory, the grantee shall, within 30 days, furnish the
requested service to such person within terms of the line extension
policy. A request for service shall be unreasonable for the purpose of
this subsection if no trunk line installation capable of servicing that
person's block has as yet been installed.
C. The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and
interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.
Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and
shall occur during periods of minimum system use.
D. The grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere
with television reception of subscribers or persons not served by the
grantee, nor shall the system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any
manner the operation of the various utilities serving the residents
within the confines of the village, nor shall other utilities interfere with
the grantee's system.
E. The grantee shall have knowledgeable, qualified grantee
representatives available to respond to customer telephone inquiries 24
hours per day and seven days per week.
F. Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time, including
wait time and the time required to transfer the call, shall not exceed 30
seconds. This standard shall be met no less than 90% of the time as
measured on an annual basis.
G. Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a busy
signal less than 3% of the total time that the office is open for business.
H. Standard installations will be performed within seven business days
after an order has been placed. A standard installation is one that is
within 175 feet of the existing system.
I. Excluding those situations constituting acts of God which are beyond its
control, the grantee will restore any service interruption promptly and
in no event later than 24 hours from the time of initial notification of
interruption of service. All other regular service requests will be
provided to within 36 hours during the normal workweek for that
system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service
calls and other installation activities will be morning or afternoon, not
to exceed a four-hour window during normal business hours for the
system, or at a time that is mutually acceptable. The grantee will
§ 116-21 BICYCLES § 116-22
101:145
schedule supplemental hours during which appointments can be
scheduled based on the needs of the community. If at any time an
installer or technician is running late, an attempt to contact the
customer will be made and the appointment rescheduled as necessary
at a time that is convenient to the customer.
J. Customer service centers and bill payment locations will be located in
the Milwaukee metropolitan area and open for walk-in customer
transactions a minimum of eight hours a day Monday through Friday,
unless there is a need to modify those hours because of the location or
customers served. The grantee and village by mutual consent will
establish supplemental hours on weekdays and weekends if it would fit
the needs of the community.
K. Subscriber credit for outages. Upon service interruption and/or outages
of subscribers' cable service, the following shall apply:
(1) For service interruptions and/or outages of over four hours and up
to seven days, the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber's
request, a credit of 1/30 of one month's fees for affected services
for each twenty-four-hour period service is interrupted for four or
more hours for any single subscriber, with the exception of
subscribers disconnected because of nonpayment or excessive
signal leakage.
(2) For service interruptions and/or outages of seven days or more in
one month, the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber's request, a
full month's credit for affected services for all affected subscribers.
L. The grantee will provide written information in each of the following
areas at the time of installation and at any future time upon the request
of the customer:
(1) Product and services offered.
(2) Prices and service options.
(3) Installation and service policies.
(4) How to use the telecommunications services.
M. Bills will be clear, concise and understandable, with all cable services
itemized.

billing cycle following the resolution of the request and the return of the
equipment by the grantee if service has been terminated.
O. Customers will be notified a minimum of 30 days in advance of any rate
or channel change, provided that the change is within the control of the
grantee.

§ 116-23. Continuity of service.
§ 116-24. Complaint procedure.
P. The grantee shall maintain and operate its network in accordance with
the rules and regulations as are incorporated herein or may be
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, the United
States Congress or the State of Wisconsin.
Q. The grantee shall continue, through the term of the franchise, to
maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this
chapter. Should the village find, by resolution, that the grantee has
failed to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, the
grantee shall be required to implement a plan for resolution. Failure to
make such improvements within three months of such resolution will
constitute a breach of a condition for which penalties contained in
§ 116-44 are applicable.
R. The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which will indicate the
nature of each service complaint received in the last 24 months, the
date and time it was received, the disposition of said complaint and the
time and date thereof. This log shall be made available for periodic
inspection by the village.
A. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service
insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are
honored. If the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify or sell the
system or the village gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew
this franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers
receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the
circumstances.
B. If there is a change of franchise or if a new operator acquires the
system, the grantee shall cooperate with the village, new franchisee or
operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During
such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period
during which it operates the system and shall be entitled to reasonable
costs for its services until it no longer operates the system.
C. If the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days
without prior approval of the village or without just cause, the village
may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until
such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable
to the village or a permanent operator is selected. If the village is
required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee shall
reimburse the village for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of
revenues from the system received by the village that are the result of
the grantee's failure to perform.
§ 116-22 BICYCLES § 116-24
101:147
A. The Village Manager is designated as having primary responsibility for
the continuing administration of the franchise and implementation of
complaint procedures.
B. During the terms of this franchise, and any renewal thereof, the grantee
shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and resolving
all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions
and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local, toll-free
telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service,
equipment functions and similar matters. The grantee will use its good
faith efforts to arrange for one or more payment locations in a central
location where customers can pay bills or conduct other business
activities.
C. As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the grantee
shall, by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish
information concerning the procedures for making inquiries or
complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of
the employee or employees or agent to whom such inquiries or
complaints are to be addressed.
D. When there have been similar complaints made or where there exists
other evidence which, in the judgment of the village, casts doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service, the village shall have the right and
authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the
performance of the system. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the
village in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a
report, if requested, within 30 days after notice. Such report shall
include the following information:
(1) The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the
special tests;
(2) What system component was tested;
(3) The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;
(4) The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was
resolved; and
(5) Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may
be required.
E. The village may require that tests be supervised by an independent
professional engineer or equivalent of the village's choice. The engineer
should sign all records of special tests and forward to the village such
records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and
recommending actions to be taken. Should such a test prove that the
grantee failed to meet the technical standard, the grantee shall bear the
cost of the test. If the test should prove that the grantee met the
technical standards, the village shall bear the cost of the test.
§ 116-24 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-24
101:148
§ 116-25. Grantee rules and regulations.
The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and
perform its obligations under this franchise and to assure an uninterrupted
service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules,
regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions
hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations.
§ 116-26. Franchise fee.
F. The village's right under this section shall be limited to requiring tests,
analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on complaints or other evidence when and under such
circumstances as the village has reasonable grounds to believe that the
complaints or other evidence requires that tests be performed to
protect the public against substandard cable service.
A. For the reason that the streets of the village to be used by the grantee in
the operation of its system within the boundaries of the village are
valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the village at
great expense to its taxpayers and that the grant to the grantee to the
streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be
required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and
acquisitions, the grantee shall pay to the village an amount equal to 3%
of the grantee's gross annual revenue from the operations of the
grantee within the confines of the village or contract area. If the
statutory five-percent limitation on franchise fees is raised or the
federal statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely, then the
franchise fee may be subject to renegotiation.
B. This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to
the village by the grantee.
C. The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be
payable quarterly on a calendar year basis to the village, and the
grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all
gross receipts as previously defined within 45 days after the quarter as
established between the village and the grantee.
D. The village shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records
and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall
take place within 24 months following the close of each of the grantee's
fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the village as a result of the
audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the
grantee by the village, which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report.
§ 116-24 BICYCLES § 116-26
101:149
§ 116-27. Transfer of ownership or control.
E. If any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty is not
made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest
shall be charged daily from such date at the legal maximum rate
charged by the United States Internal Revenue Service for late tax
payments, and the grantee shall reimburse the village for any additional
expenses and costs incurred by the village by reason of the delinquent
payment(s).
A. Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, this franchise
shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or
leased, sublet or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto,
either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein pass
to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the village.
The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly
owned subsidiary of the grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or
assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, provided
that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee.
(1) The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as
determined by the village and must agree to comply with all
provisions of the franchise.
(2) The village shall have 120 days to act upon any request for
approval of such a sale or transfer submitted in writing that
contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with FCC regulations and by the Village of Elm Grove.
The village shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed
transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated
in writing to the grantee within 120 days following receipt of
written notice and the necessary information as to the effect of the
proposed transfer or assignment upon the public unless the
requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The
village shall not unreasonably withhold such consent to the
proposed transfer.
B. Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, the grantee shall
promptly notify the village of any actual or proposed change in, or
transfer of or acquisition by any other party of control of the grantee.
The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders
but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A
rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall
arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of
persons of 10% of the voting shares of the grantee. Every change,
transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise
subject to cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented
thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change,
transfer or acquisition of control, the village may inquire into the
§ 116-26 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-27
101:150
§ 116-28. Availability of books and records.
§ 116-29. Other petitions and applications.
Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports either
submitted by the grantee to the Federal Communications Commission,
Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal or state
regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any
qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall
assist the village in such inquiry.
C. The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the village in and
to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter.
D. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village will not
approve any transfer or assignment of an initial franchise prior to
substantial completion of construction of the proposed system.
E. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without
the successor in interest becoming a signatory to this franchise
agreement.
A. The grantee shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable
times, and the village shall have the right to inspect where reasonably
necessary to the enforcement of the franchise, books, records, maps,
plans and other like materials of the grantee applicable to the cable
television system, at any time during normal business hours, provided
that where volume and convenience necessitate, the grantee may
require inspection to take place on the grantee's premises in the
Milwaukee metro area.
B. The following records and/or reports are to be made available to the
village upon request, but no more frequently than on an annual basis
unless mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the village:
(1) A quarterly review and resolution or progress report submitted by
the grantee to the village.
(2) Periodic preventive maintenance reports.
(3) Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any
supplemental forms related to equal opportunity or fair contracting
policies.
(4) Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data and the right to
review documentation concerning these inquiries and/or
complaints periodically.
(5) Periodic construction update reports, including where appropriate
the submission of as-built maps.
§ 116-27 BICYCLES § 116-29
101:151
matters affecting cable television operations authorized pursuant to the
franchise or received from such agencies shall be provided to the village
upon request.
§ 116-30. Fiscal reports.
The grantee shall file annually with the village no later than 120 days after
the end of the grantee's fiscal year a copy of a gross revenues statement
certified by an officer of the grantee.
§ 116-31. Removal of cable television system.
At the expiration of the terms for which this franchise is granted and any
renewal denied or upon its termination as provided herein, the grantee
shall forthwith, upon notice by the village, remove at its own expense all
designated portions of the cable television system from all streets and
public property within the village. If the grantee fails to do so, the village
may perform the work at the grantee's expense. Upon such notice of
removal, a bond shall be furnished by the grantee in an amount sufficient to
cover this expense.
§ 116-32. Required services and facilities.
A. The cable television system shall have a minimum channel capacity of
77 channels and at least 750 MHz of bandwidth available for future use.
B. Such system shall maintain a plant having the technical capacity for
two-way communications.
C. The grantee shall maintain the following:
(1) At least one specially designated noncommercial public access
channel available on a first-come nondiscriminatory basis; at least
one specially designated channel for use by local educational
authorities; at least one specially designated channel for local
governmental uses; and at least one specially designated channel
for leased access uses; provided, however, that these uses may be
combined on one or more channels until such time as additional
channels become necessary in the opinion of the village. Financial
and technical support and replacement and maintenance of
equipment of this facility shall be separately incorporated into a
franchise agreement.
(2) An institutional network (I-Net) of cable, optical, electrical or
electronic equipment used for the purpose of transmitting two-way
telecommunications signals interconnecting designated entities as
set forth in the franchise agreement and mutually agreed to by the
grantee and the grantor. Such institutional network may be
provided as needed by utilizing capacity on the subscriber system.
D. Interconnection.
§ 116-29 ELM GROVE CODE § 116-32
101:152
§ 116-33. Additional rules and regulations.

adjacent cable television systems for the purpose of sharing public,
educational and governmental access programming. Such
interconnection shall be made within a reasonable time limit to be
established by the village.
(2) Interconnection procedure. Upon receiving the directive of the
village to interconnect, the franchisee shall immediately initiate
negotiations with the other affected system or systems in order that
all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both
construction and operation of the interconnection link.
(3) Relief. The franchisee may be granted reasonable extensions of
time to interconnect or the village may rescind its order to
interconnect upon petition by the franchisee to the village. The
village shall grant the request if it finds that the franchisee has
negotiated in good faith and has failed to obtain an approval from
the operator or franchising authority of the system to be
interconnected or that the cost of the interconnection would cause
an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates.
(4) Cooperation required. The grantee shall cooperate with any
interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority or
village, county, state and federal regulatory agency which may be
hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing or
otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable systems
beyond the boundaries of the village.
(5) Initial technical requirements to assure future interconnection
capability.
(a) All cable systems receiving franchises to operate within the
village shall use the standard frequency allocations for
television signals.
(b) All cable systems are required to use signal processors at the
head end for each television signal.
(c) The village also urges franchisees to provide local origination
equipment that is compatible throughout the area so that
videocassettes or videotapes can be shared by various systems.
(d) The grantee shall provide such additional services and
facilities as are contained in its application, if any.
A. In addition to the inherent powers of the village to regulate and control
this cable television franchise and those powers expressly reserved by
the village or agreed to and provided for herein, the right and power is
hereby reserved by the village to promulgate such additional
regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its lawful powers
§ 116-32 BICYCLES § 116-33
101:153
§ 116-34. Performance evaluation sessions.
§ 116-35. Rate change procedures.
Pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act
of 1992, the Village of Elm Grove is currently not certified to regulate the
basic service rates charged by the grantee. Should federal or state law
permit further rate regulation beyond the basic service, the Village of Elm
Grove shall assume such rate regulation and adopt appropriate procedures
for such regulation.
§ 116-36. Termination of franchise.
and in furtherance of the terms and conditions of this franchise;
provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions
shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and
federal laws, rules and regulations.

upon application.
A. The village and the grantee may hold scheduled performance
evaluation sessions within 30 days of the third, sixth and 12th

any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to
this franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of

been vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days or unless:
declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated unless
there is compliance within such period as the Board may fix. Such
period shall not be less than 60 days, provided that no opportunity for
compliance need be granted for fraud or misrepresentation.
F. The issue of termination shall automatically be placed upon the Board
agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The Board
then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the
grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the
period, in its discretion.

acquisition by the village. In the event that the relevant federal

over the system upon resolution by the Village Board. If the village has
denied the grantee's petition for renewal of its franchise as provided by
§ 116-7, the village must exercise its option to purchase the system
within 60 days of the denial of renewal and at least six months prior to
the end of the franchise. Nothing shall prohibit the grantee, in the event
of the election of the village to purchase the system, from requesting
the court to set a reasonable bond of the village to secure the purchase
price. The grantee shall execute such warranty deeds and other

This chapter shall be known as the "Electrical Code of the Village of Elm
Grove" and will be referred to hereinafter as "this chapter."
§ 134-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish rules and regulations governing
electrical installations in the Village of Elm Grove.
§ 134-3. Electrical Inspector.
The Village Board shall appoint an Electrical Inspector upon
recommendation of the Village Manager pursuant to Chapter 54, § 54-3C,
who shall be certified as such by the state pursuant to §§ 101.82(2) and
101.88(2), Wis. Stats., concerning the inspection of public buildings and
places of employment, and pursuant to §§ 101.63(2) and 101.66(2), Wis.
Stats., concerning the inspection of one- and two-family dwellings. It shall
be the duty of the Electrical Inspector to faithfully enforce all the laws and
ordinances relating to electrical installations. The Electrical Inspector shall
maintain a record of all transactions pertaining to his or her office.
§ 134-4. License for electricians. [Amended 3-28-2016]
No person shall alter, install, or repair electrical wires, equipment or
devices for any purpose in the Village without first having procured a
license or registration per § 101.862, Wis. Stats., except for any person
meeting the requirements of § 106-3B.
§ 134-5. Electrical permit.
A. Required. No electrical equipment or installation shall be installed,
altered, renewed, replaced or connected without first obtaining an
electrical permit and paying the fee provided for under this chapter.
B. Issuance. Permits shall be issued by the Electrical Inspector upon the
payment of the applicable permit fee and the filing of a proper
application describing the nature of the work as well as such other
information as may be required for inspection. Permits are valid for a
period of 24 months from the date of issuance, after which they shall
expire and new permits shall be obtained in a manner consistent with
the provisions of § 106-3F(3). All fees are nonrefundable.
C. Inspections. All electrical work requiring a permit shall require periodic
inspections, as required by the Electrical Inspector.
D. When permits not required.
(1) No permit shall be required for the following:
§ 134-1 ELM GROVE CODE § 134-5
128:170
(a) The repair and maintenance of portable or stationary electrical
appliances and equipment previously installed in compliance
with state and municipal codes.
(b) Minor repair work such as repairing drop cords and flush and
snap switches, replacing fuses or changing lamp sockets.
(c) In single-family residences only, the extension or alteration of
an existing circuit. All circuits, together with extensions, shall
not exceed 500 watts, nor shall the circuit exceed two outlets.
(d) Electrical installations of communication systems, security
systems and signaling systems not exceeding 49 volts
electromotive force.
(2) Electrical contractor licensees shall keep a complete separate
record of all work for which a permit is not required, which record
shall be open for inspection at all times.
E. Emergency work. Emergency work may be commenced without a
permit, provided the licensee reports the same to the Electrical
Inspector within 48 hours after commencing such work and thereafter
obtains the required permit and pays the proper fee.
F. Special permit for temporary work. Special permits may be issued by
the Electrical Inspector for limited periods of time not to exceed six
months for the installation and use of temporary electric wiring and
equipment that does not conform to the regulations of this chapter.
Such permits may be authorized for buildings where conduit wiring is
required for open work and exposed wiring, lights, power for building
operations, display and decorative lighting, carnivals, circuses,
theatrical acts, exhibitions and all places of temporary outdoor
assembly. The person installing such wiring or equipment shall be
directly responsible and accountable for the safe condition of the
installation at all times and its complete removal at the end of the
temporary period, as fixed by the Inspector, or as soon as reasonably
possible when ordered by the Inspector. Such temporary work shall be
installed, maintained and operated in a safe and workmanlike manner.
All such electric wiring and equipment shall be isolated from the public
by proper elevation and guarding, and all electric fuses and switches
shall be installed in approved enclosures. Cable laid on the ground in
areas traversed by the public shall be buried in trenches or protected
by approved covers.
G. Revocation of permits.
(1) The Inspector may revoke any permit issued under this chapter and
may stop construction or use of approved new materials,
equipment or methods of construction, devices or appliances in the
event any of the following occurs:
(a) There is a violation of any applicable legal requirements.
§ 134-5 DRUG PARAPHERNALIA § 134-5
128:171
§ 134-6. Permit fees.
Electrical permit fees shall be as determined by resolution of the Board of
Trustees.
§ 134-7. Installation standards. [Amended 6-27-2016]

or heating installation and all other electrical apparatus connected with
it are in strict conformity with the provisions of Wisconsin Administrative
Code Chapter SPS 316.
§ 134-8. Right of entry.
The Electrical Inspector shall have the authority to enter all buildings and
premises during reasonable hours in the discharge of his or her official
duties. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the acquisition
of an inspection warrant in accordance with §§ 66.122 and 66.123 Wis.
Stats. and § 12-4 of the Village of Elm Grove Code of Ordinances, nor shall
it be construed to prohibit access by way of property owner and/or tenant
consent.
§ 134-9. Adoption of state code.
(b) The continuance of any construction becomes dangerous to life
or property, as determined by the Inspector.
(c) The Inspector determines that there is inadequate supervision
provided on the construction or work site.
(2) Such revocation shall be effected by written notice of the same
delivered to the applicant for the permit, the owner of the subject
premises or his or her agent or the person having charge of the
construction or activity which is the subject of such permit. A
revocation placard shall be posted on the building or structure,
equipment or appliance, as the case may be. After the notice is
delivered, it is unlawful for any person to thereafter proceed with
any construction or activity that is the subject of the permit, and
the revoked permit shall be null and void. Before any such
construction or activity may resume, a new permit shall be
obtained in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
A. Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter SPS 316, with amendments
thereto, is hereby adopted and shall be complied with by all persons,
firms or corporations performing electrical work within the scope of
this chapter within the Village. It is the intent of the Village that all
revisions to the Wisconsin State Electrical Code shall be considered to
be adopted by the Village as they occur and become effective within the
Wisconsin State Electrical Code without further revision of this chapter
or action on the part of the Village. [Amended 3-28-2016]

§ 137-1. Legislative determination.
B. Installation, alterations, replacements and repairs of electrical
equipment used for light, heat or power shall be installed in a workable
and workmanlike manner in conformity with the regulations of this
chapter.
A. Any person or firm who or which makes application for a permit under
this chapter and fails to take out the permit by failing to make
arrangements to accept delivery of the permit shall be deemed in
violation of this chapter.
B. Any person or firm who or which fails to notify the Electrical Inspector
that the work for which the permit has been procured is ready for
inspection within five working days of completion of such work shall be
deemed in violation of this chapter.
C. Any person, firm, company or corporation who or which shall violate or
assist in the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a penalty as provided in § 1-16 of this Code.
A. The Village Board finds that continuous increases in the cost of
providing adequate ambulance service to the village has created a need
for additional funds to underwrite the costs of this service. This is
despite the fact that tax funds provided by residents and village
businesses have, and will be, used for basic costs associated with the
ambulance service. In order to provide for an orderly and equitable use
of emergency medical services furnished by the Village of Elm Grove to
all persons requiring such service within the village, it is deemed
necessary to adopt a fee and rules for such service.
§ 134-9 DRUG PARAPHERNALIA § 137-1
128:173
§ 137-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the stated
meanings:
ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT  Emergency medical care that is rendered
to a sick, disabled or injured individual, based on signs, symptoms or
complaints, prior to the individual's hospitalization or while transporting
the individual between health care facilities that uses knowledge, skills
and techniques received from training beyond that which is required for
licensure in the State of Wisconsin as an emergency medical technician -
basic.
BASIC LIFE SUPPORT  Emergency medical care that is rendered to
a sick, disabled or injured individual, based on signs, symptoms or
complaints, prior to the individual's hospitalization or while transporting
the individual between health care facilities and that is limited to use of
the knowledge, skills and techniques received from training required for
licensure in the State of Wisconsin as an emergency medical technician -
basic.
COMMERCIAL HEALTH FACILITY  Facilities that routinely provide
routine, urgent and/or emergency medical care to patients, including but
B. The Village Board finds that, historically, substantial financial
contributions for ambulance vehicles and major equipment components
carried on those vehicles have been received from village residents and
their families and others affiliated with them and village businesses on
behalf of themselves and their employees.
C. The Village Board further finds that the staffing of village ambulances
has occurred on a voluntary paid on-call basis by persons, many of
whom are village residents, village business operators and their
employees with minimal compensation to them for their many long
hours of services and training. [Amended 12-11-2000]
D. The Village Board finds that the value of financial and in-kind labor
contribution by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, many of
whom are village residents and business people, must be recognized in
the establishment of any fee. [Amended 12-11-2000]
E. The Village Board finds that in establishing fees the failure to
differentiate between persons who as a class have contributed to the
establishment and ongoing operation of the ambulance service and
those who as a class have not or are not likely to make such
contributions will have an adverse effect on future receipt of financial
and in-kind service donations vital and necessary for the operation of
this ambulance service.
F. The following provisions are authorized, and it is further declared that
the fees established herein shall be for the purpose of providing
revenue to assist in defraying the costs of the ambulance service.
§ 137-1 ELM GROVE CODE § 137-2

not limited to private physicians' offices and chiropractic offices but
excluding residential or assisted living facilities.[Amended 12-11-2000]
NONRESIDENT OF THE VILLAGE  Any person who is not a resident of
the village.
RESIDENT OF THE VILLAGE  Any person whose primary legal residence
pursuant to the laws of the State of Wisconsin is within the village.
§ 137-3. Fees; geographic area of operation.
§ 137-4. Review of fees.
The fees as provided under this chapter shall be reviewed annually by
the Emergency Medical Services Director, taking into account current
manpower, equipment, material and maintenance costs, and by the Village
Board for adjustment.
§ 137-5. Fees to be binding.
The above fees shall be binding upon all persons receiving such services as
well as their successors in interest, assigns, estates and heirs.
§ 137-6. Enforcement.
The Village Attorney may enforce the provisions of this chapter by civil
action in court for the collection of amounts due and any other appropriate
relief.
§ 137-7. Services not to be refused for nonpayment.
Nothing in this chapter shall authorize any village department or personnel
to refuse or delay any service to any person that has not paid for services or
that owes for previous services.
Chapter 143
A. The Emergency Medical Services Director or designee shall collect a
fee as established in the fee schedule adopted from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Trustees. The Emergency Medical Services
Director shall, however, have discretion to adjust the amount of fee
levied in a particular circumstance based on the nature of the response,
the level of services needed and/or provided and other various
circumstances of the request for services and/or response the
Emergency Medical Services Director deems, in his or her judgment, to
be relevant.

FAIR HOUSING
§ 143-1. Declaration of intent.
§ 143-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DISCRIMINATE AND DISCRIMINATION  To segregate, separate, exclude
or treat any person unequally only because of sex, race, color, religion,
national origin, sexual orientation, as defined in § 111.32(13m), Wis. Stats.,
handicap, sex or marital status of the person maintaining a household,
lawful source of income, age or ancestry. It is intended that the factors set
forth herein shall be the sole basis for prohibiting discrimination.
HOUSING  Any improved property, including any mobile home as defined
in § 66.058, Wis. Stats., which is used or occupied or is intended, arranged
or designed to be used or occupied as a home or residence.
UNIMPROVED RESIDENTIAL LOT  Any residential lot upon which no
permanent building or structure containing living quarters has been
constructed.
§ 143-3. Discrimination prohibited.
No person shall discriminate:
A. It is the intent of this chapter to render discrimination in housing
unlawful. It is our belief that in a small community removal of
discrimination is best accomplished by education and quiet persuasion
rather than by court litigation; however, it is the declared policy of this
village that all persons shall have an equal opportunity for housing
regardless of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry, and it is
the duty of this village to assist in the orderly prevention or removal of
all discrimination in housing.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit an owner or his or
her agent from requiring information concerning family, marital,
financial and business status but not concerning race, color or creed.
A. By refusing to sell, lease, finance or contract to construct housing or by
refusing to discuss the terms thereof.
B. By refusing to permit inspection or exacting different or more stringent
price, terms or conditions for the sale, lease or rental of housing.
C. By refusing to finance or sell an unimproved residential lot or to
construct a home or residence upon such lot.
D. By publishing, circulating, issuing or displaying or causing to be
published, circulated, issued or displayed any communication, notice,
advertisement or sign in connection with the sale, financing, lease or
§ 137-7 ELM GROVE CODE § 143-3
143:176
§ 143-4. Enforcement.
The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced by the Village Attorney. The
Village Attorney, upon receipt of a complaint verified by the complainant,
may issue a complaint if in his or her judgment an action of discrimination is
sustainable in court and will, giving due consideration to available state and
federal laws, assist in the elimination of discrimination. The complaint may
be filed in the Circuit Court seeking a temporary injunction or restraining
order pending final disposition of the complaint.
§ 143-5. Violations and penalties. [Amended 7-26-2005]
Any person who willfully violates any provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a penalty as provided in § 1-16 of this Code, except that the
forfeiture shall not be less than $100. Payment of any such forfeiture shall
be stayed during the period in which any appeal may be taken and during
the pendency of any appeal.

ARTICLE III
Chronic Nuisance Property
[Adopted 4-22-2008]
§ 208-12. Findings.
§ 208-13. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTY  Any residentially zoned or
residentially used parcel of land or structure which has generated three or
more calls for police service for nuisance activities on separate days in one
month, or six or more calls in a twelve-month period.
NUISANCE ACTIVITY 
A. The Village Board finds that any residential property that has generated
three or more calls for police service for nuisance activities in one
month, or six or more calls in a period of 12 months, has received more
than the level of general and adequate police service and has placed an
undue and inappropriate burden on the taxpayers of the Village. The
Village Board further finds that residential property owners are in a
better position than commercial property owners to control who enters
their property and to control the activities which take place thereon, as
opposed to commercial property owners, which often hold their
properties open to the public. The Village Board further finds that as a
matter of policy it does not want to discourage commercial property
owners from reporting offenses committed against them.
B. The Village Board therefore directs the Chief of Police and the Village
Clerk, as provided in this article, to charge the owners of such property
the costs associated with providing police and administrative services
for purposes of abating the violations at property where nuisance
activities occur.

in by property owners, operators, tenants, occupants, or persons

twelve-month period, and said nuisance activities are verifiable events,
the Chief of Police shall notify the property owner in writing that the
property is a chronic nuisance property, and any further violations
within said month or twelve-month period will be cause for levying a

warning lights shall be maintained upon the same at night. All
other necessary precautions shall be taken to guard the public

that may result from his or her neglect of necessary precaution
against all accidents to persons or property of others.

193:251
§ 232-4. Annual budget. [Amended 3-23-2004]
The Village Public Works/Utilities Committee shall cooperate with the
Finance Committee and the Village Manager in the preparation of an annual
budget for the sewer system for consideration by the Village Board of
Trustees. All of such budgets shall be subject to the approval of the Village
Board of Trustees.11
§ 232-5. Deleterious discharge prohibited.
No substance or amount of any substance prohibited by the regulation
of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District periodically as amended
shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Any person found to be
responsible for the discharge of any substance into the sewer system which
causes damage to the sewer system or treatment facility shall, in addition to
a forfeiture, pay the amount of damages incurred by the Village and, upon
order of the Village, remedy the condition resulting in the discharge.
(1) The Public Works/Utilities Committee may designate certain
inspectors to investigate and check all buildings within an area
suspected to be a clear water infiltration area. Such inspectors
shall have the power, after reasonable notice, to enter such
premises for the purpose of any inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing deemed necessary by said
inspectors to ensure compliance with this article. If, however, any
inspector is denied entry after presentation of his or her
identification, he or she may procure a special inspection warrant
in accordance with § 66.122, Wis. Stats. If such inspectors deem
such evidence or findings are inconclusive or if the property owner
makes such a request, an outside test shall be made by pouring a
colored dye mixed with water into a hole drilled a short distance
from the outside wall of the building and then checking the nearest
downstream manhole to such premises to determine if the colored
water is flowing into the manhole.
(2) Such inspectors shall report their findings to the Public Works/
Utilities Committee and the Public Works/Utilities Committee shall
then have the power to direct such property owners to disconnect
any downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, sump
pumps, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater which
discharge clear water, directly or indirectly, into the sanitary
extension sewer system of the Village.

§ 232-6. Grease interceptor permit required. [Added 4-10-2000;
amended 8-26-2003; 3-23-2004; 6-27-2016]
Any property owner, or property owners agent or lessee, who is required
by Wisconsin Administrative Code Section SPS 382.34, or any amendment
thereto, to install and maintain a grease interceptor, shall obtain a grease
interceptor permit from the Village.
A. Application. Application for a permit shall be made on forms provided
by the Village, disclosing therein the following:
(1) The name(s) and telephone number(s) of the person(s) responsible
for the maintenance of the grease interceptor;
(2) The means by which the captured material is to be disposed;
(3) The name of any currently licensed waste disposal firms contracted
to dispose of the captured material; and
(4) The record of dates and means of disposal of all captured material
during the previous permit years.
B. Inspection. Upon receipt of an application, the Village Plumbing
Inspector shall make, or shall cause to be made, an inspection of the
grease interceptor to assure that the permitted premises and the
grease interceptor are in compliance with Wisconsin Administrative
Code Section SPS 382.34. Inspections shall be made at least once every
two years, and at such other times as the Village Plumbing Inspector
shall deem necessary.
C. Fee. The applicant shall pay an investigation and compliance fee to
cover the Village's cost of administrating this compliance program. This
fee relates solely to the inspection and monitoring described in this
section and is separate from all other fees charged by the Public Works/
Utilities Committee. The fee, which shall be established by the Village
Board by resolution from time to time, shall be paid at the time the
applicant makes application.
D. Expiration; renewal; transfer. Grease interceptor permits shall expire
on June 30 of every other year. Renewals shall be handled in the same
manner as original applications. Permits issued under this section are
personal and may not be transferred.
E. Revocation of permit. Permits issued under this section may be
revoked, or withheld, by the Village Plumbing Inspector whenever the
Village Plumbing Inspector determines that the permit holder has
violated any provision of Wisconsin Administrative Code Section SPS
382.34, including but not limited to allowing deleterious waste material
to be introduced into the Village sewer. Continued operation under a
revoked permit shall constitute a violation of § 232-9 of this article.

conditioner, exterior foundation drain, areaway drain, sump pump or
other source of surface runoff, stormwater, surface water, clear water
waste, or groundwater shall be allowed to flow, directly or indirectly,
into the Village sanitary sewer system.
B. The Board of Trustees finds that direct or indirect discharge of any
surface runoff, stormwater, surface water, clear water waste or
groundwater into the Village sanitary sewer system is a significant
factor in causing sanitary sewers to overflow and thereby contributing
to sewage backup into basements. Therefore, any such direct or
indirect flow of such waters into the Village sanitary sewer system is
hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance and violations of this
section may be prosecuted in the manner provided for in Chapter 823 of
the Wisconsin statutes, as amended from time to time, as well as by any
other means provided under this article or any applicable law.
A. The Village of Elm Grove shall maintain the sewer service main within
the Village limits.
B. The owner of any property receiving sewer service through any lateral
connections ("properly owner") shall maintain the sewer lateral from
the point of connection to the main sewer to the structure receiving
service, including but not limited to all connective fittings such as wye
joints. This shall include payment of all expenses associated with the
cleaning, maintenance or repair or replacement of the lateral line,
restoration of lawn or other landscaping improvements, which at the
discretion of the Village may be undertaken, and repair of the street, if
necessary, in accordance with Village of Elm Grove road cut
specifications.
C. The property owner must notify the Village in writing prior to initiating
work on any lateral other than routine cleaning. It shall be the property
owner's responsibility to keep the sewer service lateral free from
obstruction or defective conditions at all times.

at the time of sentencing under § 232-9 and nonpayment of such expenses
shall result in imprisonment in the Waukesha County Jail.
complete replacement of the existing lateral with a new PVC lateral
entirely at the expense of the property owner.
(2) An exception to the replacement of an existing lateral may be
granted by the Village Director of Public Works if satisfactory
evidence is submitted timely demonstrating that the existing
lateral is of PVC construction or the existing lateral has been lined,
and the existing lateral has been televised demonstrating that it is
entirely free from major defects.
(3) In the event of abandonment, the lateral shall be severed from the
main and a permanent seal, of a method and material approved by
the Director of Public Works, shall be placed at the main connection
so as to permanently seal the main from infiltration. The
abandonment shall be inspected and tested to the satisfaction of
the Director of Public Works. The permanent seal shall be installed
by the property owner at the owner's sole expense. All inspection
costs shall be the responsibility of the property owner and will be
charged in accordance with § 30-3 of the Village Code.

to public safety. When convicted sex offenders re-enter society, they are
much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-arrested for
a new sexually based crime. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex
offenders, and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to
minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where
they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections
afforded by state law. The Village finds and declares that, in addition to
schools and day-care centers, children congregate or play in a number of
public places, including public parks and other facilities for children. It
is the intent of this chapter to serve the Village's compelling interest to
promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of Village
citizens by creating areas around locations where children regularly
congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders are
prohibited from entering or establishing residency.

Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prohibit any person from driving
a vehicle upon Florence Drive, provided that the entrance which is open to
vehicular traffic is used to gain access.
§ 243-4. Posting of signs.
The Village shall post the appropriate signs so that members of the public
have notice that the right-of-way for vehicular traffic is restricted and to
provide notice to the public that the right-of-way remains open to pedestrian
traffic.

241:279
§ 243-5. Maintenance of closed portion by Village.
The Village retains the right to maintain the portion of Florence Drive which
is closed or obstructed pursuant to the provisions of this article.
§ 243-6. Removal of obstruction or reopening of street.

ARTICLE II
Posting of Building Numbers at Private Drive Entrances
[Adopted 4-23-2002]
§ 243-8. Findings; purpose; definitions.
§ 243-9. Posting requirement.
Owners of privately owned buildings located on private drives shall
cooperate with the Village in the placement of a sign by the Village that
identifies the street number(s) of such buildings within the public right-ofway
abutting such private drives.
§ 243-10. Sign specifications. [Amended 6-24-2002]
Any street number sign required under § 243-9 shall meet the following
requirements, except where, for reasons of potential confusion, uniqueness
of location or other compelling public safety reasons, the Village Board
authorizes a variance from the requirements of Subsection A, B or E (only
in regard to compliance with the design criteria for Exhibit A13), provided
the owners of all buildings accessed by the private drive have, by a majority
vote where a legally recognized homeowner's association does not exist,
made a timely request for a variance, in writing. If a homeowner's
association exists, a vote consistent with the governing documents for the
homeowner's association shall control.
A. Findings. The Village Board of Elm Grove finds that buildings located on
privately owned roads and driveways within the Village do not have
clearly posted street numbers that are clearly visible from the public
right-of-way. The Village Board of Elm Grove further finds that the lack
of clearly posted street numbers for buildings presents the potential for

[Amended 3-23-2004]
The Public Works/Utilities Committee of the Village Board shall have

§ 266-3. Dutch elm disease, Emerald Ash Borer, oak wilt control
and prevention, and elm bark beetles. [Amended 5-28-2007;
2-24-2014]
A. Intent and purpose of chapter: to declare Dutch elm disease, elm bark
beetles, Emerald Ash Borer, and oak wilt public nuisances.
(1) Whereas, the Village Board has determined that there are many
elm Trees growing on public and private premises within the
Village, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value
of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of
public and private premises and erode the tax base of the Village.
The health and life of these Trees is threatened by a fatal disease
known as "Dutch elm disease," which is spread by the elm bark
beetles Scolytus multistriatus (Eichb.) or Hylurgopinus rufipes
(March). The Village Board hereby declares its intention to control
and prevent the spread of Dutch elm disease and the insect pests
and vectors that carry such disease and declares Dutch elm disease
and the elm bark beetles that carry such disease to be public
nuisances.
(2) Whereas, the Village Board has determined that there are many
oak Trees growing on public and private premises within the
Village, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value
of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of
public and private premises and erode the tax base of the Village.
The health and life of these Trees is threatened by a fatal disease
known as "oak wilt disease," which is spread by Nitidulid beetles.
The Village Board hereby declares its intention to control and
prevent the spread of oak wilt disease and the insect pests and
vectors that carry such disease and declares that oak wilt disease
and Nitidulid beetles that carry such disease are public nuisances.
(3) Whereas, the Village Board has determined that there are many
ash Trees growing on public and private premises within the
Village, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value
of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of
public and private premises and erode the tax base of the Village.
The health and life of these Trees is threatened by an extremely
aggressive exotic insect known as Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire or
Emerald Ash Borer. The Village Board hereby declares its intention
§ 266-2 TRAILERS AND CAMPING § 266-3
259:317
to control and prevent the spread of Emerald Ash Borer by any
current method.
B. Abatement of Hazardous or Public Nuisances; duty of Forester.
(1) Whenever the Forester, after inspection, reasonably determines
that a public nuisance, as herein defined, exists on public property
in the Village, the Forester shall immediately abate or cause the
abatement of such nuisance in such manner as to destroy or
prevent as fully as possible the spread of Dutch elm disease, oak
wilt and any vectors which would carry these diseases and any ash
Trees with Emerald Ash Borer. [Amended 5-28-2007]
(2) When the Forester reasonably determines that a public nuisance
exists upon private premises, the Forester shall immediately serve
or cause to be served, personally or by registered mail, an
abatement notice. The abatement notice shall be served on the
owner of such property, if the owner can be found, or otherwise

(5) Permit Revocation occurs when there is a violation of any provision
of this chapter and shall be grounds for revocation of any permit or
approval issued pursuant to this chapter.
A. Legislative intent. It is the intent of the Board of Trustees to regulate
the growth of certain regulated vegetation and to prohibit the planting
of controlled vegetation within the Village. In the exercise of its police
power and in recognition of further statutory authority conferred by
§ 66.96, Wis. Stats., the Board finds that attractive and well-maintained
property will enhance the neighborhoods and Village and will provide a
suitable environment for increasing physical and monetary value and
that the growth of certain regulated vegetation as defined herein:
(1) Attracts rodents;
(2) Invites unwanted dumping of grass clippings and other organic and
inorganic waste material on undeveloped or partly developed
parcels of land within the Village;
(3) Creates, under certain circumstances, fire hazards;
(4) At certain times of the year serves to adversely intensify the
pollution of the air substances which would affect persons with
allergenic producing hay fever or other allergenic-related illnesses;
(5) Gives an appearance of neglect which is inconsistent with
surrounding properties to the overall detriment of the Village; and
(6) Violates state public policy with respect to certain noxious weeds
which by statutory definition are per se an impermissible form of
vegetation.
B. Duty to destroy.
(1) Any person or legal entity owning, occupying or controlling land
located in Elm Grove and without regard to its level of development
shall destroy all regulated vegetation thereon; provided, however,
that grass or weeds regulated under Subsection H of the definition
of "regulated vegetation" in § 266-1 shall be brought into
compliance with the height requirements contained therein
through mowing or cutting.
(2) Persons owning property having controlled vegetation located
thereon are encouraged to Remove such controlled vegetation
whenever practicable.
C. Planting of controlled vegetation prohibited. No person shall plant any
controlled vegetation in the Village.
D. Maintenance of yards and lot areas.
§ 266-5 TRAILERS AND CAMPING § 266-6
259:323
(1) Landscaping, plantings and other decorative surface treatments,
including common species of grass, shall be installed if necessary
and maintained to present an attractive appearance in all yards and
lot areas except a wooded lot. In the absence of an approved land
management plan from the Plan Commission pursuant to the
delegated authority of this chapter, grasses shall be maintained to a
height not to exceed seven inches in length. Plantings shall be
maintained so as not to present hazards to adjoining properties or
to persons or vehicles traveling on public ways and shall be
maintained so as to enhance the appearance and value of the
neighborhood and the Village.
(2) No person, or entity shall place brush on any public right-of-way or
any public property for the purpose of its Removal by the Village
Department of Public Works or any other entity any earlier than the
Friday preceding the first day of the week posted for municipal
brush pickup in the respective area where placed or more than 72
hours in advance of any contracted pickup time. Violators of this
provision shall be subject to a special charge per Village truckload
at the current rate of service, or fraction thereof, for Removal of
brush by the Village. [Amended 4-22-2008; 9-28-2015]
E. Authority of Fire Chief to abate fire threat. All yard areas and grass
areas shall be cut between June 30 and October 15 when the Fire Chief
so orders consistent with his or her professional determination that the
length of such yard or grass areas poses an unreasonable threat from
fire to the safety of the area in question or its surrounding
neighborhood.
F. Application for approval of land management plan. Any owner or lessee,
with the consent of the owner, of land in the Village may apply with the
Plan Commission for approval of a land management plan for a natural
lawn, one where the grasses exceed seven inches in height, as follows:
(1) Application requirements. Each application for a land management
plan shall be on a form provided by the Village Clerk. A copy of the
application shall be mailed by the applicant or given personally by
the applicant to each of the owners of record, as listed in the office
of the Village Assessor, who are owners of the property situated in
whole or in part within 200 feet of the boundaries of the properties
affected. The Village Clerk shall provide the list of the property
owners who are to be notified of the application. The applicant shall
certify, under oath, on a form to be furnished by the Village Clerk
that such owners have been duly notified and the manner in which
they have been notified. If, within 15 days of receipt of a copy of the
application, at least 51% of such property owners file written
objections to the application with the Village Clerk, then such
application shall be referred to the Plan Commission for public
hearing prior to decision. Such a hearing shall be noticed with a
Class 2 notice at the expense of the applicant.

plan may be revoked for failure to comply with the requirements of
this chapter. Notice of intent to revoke a land management plan
shall be appealable to the Board of Trustees pursuant to the
delegated authority of this chapter. All applications for appeal shall
be submitted within 15 days of notice of intent to revoke a land
management plan. [Amended 2-26-2013]
G. Duty to comply with written order. In the event that any person or legal
entity owning, occupying or controlling land located in Elm Grove is
served with an order in writing by the Elm Grove Weed Commissioner
to destroy regulated vegetation or Remove and destroy newly planted
controlled vegetation (served by a type of delivery service of which the

§ 305-12. General requirements.
The proposed land division shall conform to:
§ 305-13. Streets.
A. The provisions of Chapter 236 of the Wisconsin Statutes;
B. All applicable ordinances of the village;
C. The Official Map;
D. The rules of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation and Waukesha
County relating to safety of access and the preservation of the public
interest and investment in the streets if the subdivision or any lot
contained therein abuts on a state trunk highway or connecting street.
A. General considerations. The streets shall be designed and located in
relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions
and natural terrain features such as streams and existing tree growth,
to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to
the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
B. Conform to Official Map. The arrangement, width, grade and location of
all streets shall conform to the Official Map of the village, if any exists.
C. Arrangement.
(1) Arterial streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of major streets and highways.
(2) Collector streets shall be properly related to the mass transit
system, to special traffic generating from facilities such as schools,
churches and shopping areas, to population densities, and to the
primary streets into which they feed.
(3) Secondary streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible
to topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and sewer systems, and to require the minimum
amount of street necessary to provide convenient, safe access to
property.
(4) Railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. Where a land
division borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited
access highway right-of-way, the Plan Commission may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-ofway,
at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land as for park purposes in residential districts or for
commercial or industrial purposes in other districts.
§ 305-12 LAND DIVISION § 305-13
305:359
(5) Access onto arterial and collector streets. Where a land division
borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector
street, the Plan Commission may require that marginal access
streets be provided, that the backs of lots abut the primary or
collector street and be provided with screen planting contained in a
nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, and that other
provisions be made for the adequate protection of residential
properties and the separation of through and local traffic.
(6) Width. The right-of-way and roadway of all streets shall be of the
width specified on the Official Map or Master Plan or, if no width is
specified there, they shall be not less than the width specified
below:
Road Type
Right-of-Way
(feet)
Roadway
(feet)
Arterial street 80 48
Collector street 60 36
Secondary and marginal
access streets
60 30
(7) Grades. The grade of major and collector streets shall not exceed
6%, unless necessitated by exceptional topography and approved
by the Plan Commission. The grade of all other streets shall not
exceed 10%. The minimum grade of all streets shall be 0.3%.
(8) Horizontal curves. A minimum sight distance with clear visibility,
measured along the center line, shall be provided of at least 300
feet on major streets, 200 feet for collector streets and 100 feet on
minor streets.
(9) Vertical curves. All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to 15 times the
algebraic difference in the rate of grade for major streets and
collector streets and 1/2 of this minimum length for all other
streets.
(10) Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on major and collector streets.
(11) Street names. New street names shall not duplicate the names of
existing streets, but streets that are continuations of others already
in existence and named shall bear the name of the existing streets.
(12) Cul-de-sac or dead-end streets. Streets designed to have one end
permanently closed shall not exceed 500 feet in length and shall
terminate with a turnaround of not less than 100 feet in diameter of
right-of-way and a roadway turnaround of 80 feet in diameter.

(13) Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where their control is definitely placed in the
village under conditions approved by the Plan Commission.
(14) Half-streets. Where a half-street is adjacent to the subdivision, the
other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider.
(15) Intersections.
(a) Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and
not more than two streets shall intersect at one point unless
approved by the Plan Commission.
(b) Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius of 15 feet or of a greater radius where the Plan
Commission considers it necessary.
(c) Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment
shall be continuous.
A. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities where required by the Plan Commission and shall
be at least 10 feet wide.
B. Where a land division is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or
drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the
drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and
adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
A. General. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for
the location of the land division and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
B. Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of
the underlying zoning district.
C. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street
service and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated.
D. Residential lots, fronting on major streets and highways, should be
platted with extra depth to permit generous distances between the
structures and such traffic ways.
§ 305-13 LAND DIVISION § 305-15
305:361
E. Access to public street. Every lot shall front or abut on a public street.
Lots with an access only to private drives or streets shall be permitted
only with Plan Commission approval.
F. Lots at right angles. Lots at right angles to each other should be
avoided wherever possible, especially in residential areas.
G. Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
H. Large lots. In case a tract is subdivided into parcels containing two or
more acres, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the resubdivision of
any parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
I. Municipal boundaries. Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines
whenever practicable, rather than cross them.
J. Double frontage. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be
avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages
of topography and orientation.

ARTICLE VII
Required Improvements
§ 305-17. Development agreement.
Before final approval of a plat, the subdivider shall install street and utility
improvements as hereinafter provided. If such improvements are not
installed as required at the time that the final plat is submitted for approval,
the subdivider shall, before the approval of the plat, enter into a
development agreement with Elm Grove agreeing to install the required
improvements and file, as a condition of execution of said developer's
agreement, a bond in the amount of 110% of the estimated cost of the
improvements and in form meeting the approval of the Village Attorney or
a certified check in an amount equal to 110% of the estimated cost of the
improvements. This estimate is to be made by the Village Engineer, as a
guaranty that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or his
subcontractors not later than one year from the date of recording of the plat
and as a further guaranty that all obligations to subcontractors for work on
the development are satisfied.
§ 305-18. Village Engineer's approval of contractors and
subcontractors.
Contractors and subcontractors who are to be engaged in the construction
of street and utility improvements on dedicated street rights-of-way shall be
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.

305:366
ARTICLE VIII
Variances
§ 305-22. Variance or waiver of provisions.
When, in the judgment of the Board of Appeals, it would be inappropriate
to apply literally a provision of this chapter because extraordinary hardship
would result, it may waive or vary such provisions so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured, provided that in no event shall
the requirement of filing and recording the plat or survey map be waived.

§ 325-8. Control of erosion and pollutants during land disturbance
and development.
A. Applicability. This article applies to the following sites of land
development or land disturbing activities: [Amended 3-8-1999]
(1) Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or the construction or
demolition, as that term is defined in Chapter 106, Building
Construction, § 106-12A of the Village Code, of any house or
commercial, industrial or institutional buildings.
(2) Those requiring a certified survey approval or the construction of
houses or commercial, industrial or institutional buildings on lots of
approved certified surveys.
(3) Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or
vegetation, excavation, land filling or other land disturbing activity
affecting a surface area of 4,000 square feet or more.
(4) Those involving excavation or filling or a combination of excavation
and filling affecting 40 cubic yards or more of dirt, sand or other
excavation or fill material. [Amended 2-24-2009]
(5) Those involving street, highway, road or bridge construction,
enlargement, relocation or reconstruction.
(6) Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing or enlarging of an
underground pipe or facility for a distance of 300 feet or more.
B. Erosion and other pollutant control requirements. The following
requirements shall be met on all sites described in Subsection A:
(1) Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upslope
chambers, hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other
appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of 100
microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate. If the
water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than 100
microns during dewatering operations, then no control is needed
before discharge, except as determined by the Public Works
§ 325-6 LAND DIVISION § 325-8
305:375
Director. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes
erosion of the site or receiving channels.
(2) Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building
materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
toxic materials or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed
and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or
storm sewer system.
(3) Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and
parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment
reaching a public or private road shall be removed by street
cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday.
(4) Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with
a straw bale, filter fabric or equivalent barrier meeting accepted
design criteria, standards and specifications.
(5) Site erosion control. The following criteria [Subsection B(5)(a)
through (d)] apply only to land development or land disturbing
activities that result in runoff leaving the site:
(a) Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the
site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical.
Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as described below
in Subsection B(5)(c)[3]. Sheet flow runoff from adjacent areas
greater than 10,000 square feet in area shall also be diverted
around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff
velocities of less than 0.5 feet per second across the disturbed
area for the set of one-year design storms. Diverted runoff shall
be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance
and receiving channels.
(b) All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical
sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one
time.
(c) Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be
controlled by meeting either Subsection B(5)(c)[1] and [2] or
[1] and [3].
[1] All disturbed ground left inactive for 21 or more days shall
be stabilized by seeding or sodding (only available prior to
September 15) or by mulching or covering or other
equivalent control measure. Because of inclement weather
or extenuating circumstances, the Building Inspector may
vary this requirement up to 30 days.
[2] For sites with more than 10 acres disturbed at one time, or
if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more
sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Each

305:376
§ 325-9. Permit and control plan required.
No landowner or land user may commence a land disturbance or land
development activity subject to this article without receiving prior approval
of a control plan for the site and a permit from the Public Works Director. At
least one landowner or land user controlling or using the site and desiring
to undertake a land disturbing or land developing activity subject to this
article shall submit an application for a permit and a control plan and pay
an application fee to the Village of Elm Grove. By submitting an application,
the applicant is authorizing the Village personnel and agents to enter the
site to obtain information required for the review of the control plan.
sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least
1% of the area draining to the basin and at least three
feet of depth and shall be constructed in accordance with
accepted design specifications. Sediment shall be removed
to maintain a depth of three feet. The basin shall be
designed to trap sediment greater than 15 microns in
size, based on the set of one-year design storms having
durations from 0.5 to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate
shall also be sufficiently low so as not to cause erosion
along the discharge channel or the receiving water.
[3] For sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time,
filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures
shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of
the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes
through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the
channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel.
(d) Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than 10 cubic
yards of material should not be located with a downslope
drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage
channel. If remaining for more than seven days, they shall be
stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps or other means.
Erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than
seven days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter
fence barriers around the pile. In-street utility repair or
construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25
feet to a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with
tarps or suitable alternative control if exposed for more than
seven days, and the storm drain inlets must be protected with
straw bales or other appropriate filtering barriers.

§ 325-37. Stormwater discharge criteria.
A. Stormwater discharges shall be treated to achieve the levels of
pollutant removals specified in the adopted Village stormwater
management system plan. Unless otherwise specified in the abovenoted
plans, stormwater management measures shall be designed with
the general goal of removing, on an average annual basis, 80% of the
suspended solids load that may be expected in the absence of control.
To achieve this level of removal, the stormwater management measures
shall be designed to accommodate, at a minimum, the runoff volume
resulting from 1.5 inches of rainfall.
B. Discharge of urban stormwater pollutants to wetlands shall be
minimized to the extent practicable. Significant degradation of wetland
functional values due to stormwater pollutant loading shall be avoided.
C. Stormwater discharges shall be pretreated prior to infiltration to
prolong maintenance of the infiltration capacity and to prevent
discharge of stormwater pollutants and concentrations that would
result in exceeding groundwater quality standards established by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
D. Stormwater detention, retention and infiltration facilities shall not be
located closer than allowed by applicable sections of the Wisconsin
Administrative Code. The stormwater management plan shall show all
wells within the following areas: 100 feet from a well serving a private
water system; or 1,200 feet from a well serving a municipal or a
community/subdivision water supply system; or within the wellhead
protection areas of a well serving a municipal or a community/
subdivision water supply system, if such a protection area has been
delineated. Copies of any variances to the Administrative Code obtained
from the state must be furnished to the Village prior to the start of
construction.
E. In the design of the stormwater facilities and measures, due
consideration shall be given to the design criteria and standards set
forth in the Wisconsin Stormwater Manual prepared and published by
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and as may be revised
from time to time.
A. The conveyance and storage facilities incorporated into the site-specific
stormwater management system plan required under this article shall
be designed as an integral part of existing stormwater systems,
provided that there is no downstream flooding. In the event that there is
downstream flooding, the Village Engineer may require site-specific
measures that will not increase downstream storm flows.
B. Design criteria and standards for stormwater management measures
shall be made available by the Village Clerk in cooperation with the
Village Engineer.

Small Watersheds" (Technical Release 55: Engineering Division, United
States Department of Agriculture, June 1992), Natural Resources
Conservation Service or other methods approved by the Village
Engineer.
E. Unless otherwise specified in the Village stormwater management
system plan or where determined by the Village Engineer to be not
needed, the peak flow discharge rates of stormwater runoff from the
site under post-development conditions shall not exceed the rates
under existing conditions, as calculated under § 325-34F.
A. A higher level of quality in the stormwater discharge is required to
protect sensitive environmental resources.
B. A higher level of protection from ponding or flooding is required to
protect the public health and safety.
C. Provisions are available to manage the stormwater runoff by off-site
facilities, provided that all of the following conditions are met for the

A. Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged into the storm drainage system or MS4 or watercourses
any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters
containing any pollutants, that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards as referenced in § 325-50, above,
other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this article: water line flushing or other potable
water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted
stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration into
storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or
footing drains or sump pump (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air-conditioning
condensation, springs, individual residential washing of vehicles,

stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, unless the connection:
(a) was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing
at the time of connection; and
(b) Was documented as allowable contemporaneously with the
installation of each connection; and
(c) Does not currently allow any pollutant to enter the MS4.
(3) A person shall be deemed to be in violation of this article if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such
a connection to continue. In the event there is any modification of a
property or structure that requires a permit of any kind, all
connections that may otherwise presently be illicit connections
shall be corrected even if they have a documented allowable prior
status.
A. Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Public
Works Director may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of
persons or to the MS4 or navigable waters of the State of Wisconsin, as
defined by Wisconsin case law. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the Elm Grove Public Works
Director may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or navigable waters of the State of
Wisconsin or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.
(1) Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may
have its MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The Elm Grove Public Works Director or
his designee will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the Elm Grove Public Works
Director or his designee for a reconsideration and hearing.
(2) A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior
written approval of the Elm Grove Public Works Director.

stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Public
Works Director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Public Works Director access

305:409
§ 325-55. Prevention, control and reduction of stormwater
pollutants by use of best management practices.
The Public Works Director may provide requirements identifying best
management practices (BMP) for any activity, operation, or facility which
may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
storm drain system, or waters of the State of Wisconsin. The owner or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent
the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid WPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the WPDES
permit.
§ 325-56. Waters of the State of Wisconsin protection.
Every person owning or occupying property through which waters of the
State of Wisconsin passes shall keep and maintain that part of the waters of
the State of Wisconsin within the property free of pollution.
§ 325-57. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
Grove Public Works Director or his designee reasonable access to
the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this article.
(7) If the Public Works Director or his designee has been refused
access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is
discharged, and he is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Elm Grove
Public Works Director or his designee may seek issuance of a
special inspection warrant pursuant to § 66.0119, Wis. Stats., from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 325-54 ELM GROVE CODE § 325-57
305:410
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain
system, or water of the State of Wisconsin, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify the Elm Grove Police Department of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Village of Elm Grove in person or
by phone or facsimile within 24 hours of becoming aware of the release.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Public Works Director within three business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of
such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 325-58. Enforcement.
§ 325-59. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the Elm Grove Public Works Director. The notice of appeal must be received
within 90 days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the
appeal before the Elm Grove Board of Appeals shall take place within a
reasonable time from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal.
A. Notice of violation. Whenever the Public Works Director finds that a
person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
article, he may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:

ARTICLE II
Stormwater Management Service Charges
§ 326-7. Purpose.
There is hereby established a uniform system of stormwater service charges
that shall apply to each and every lot or parcel within the Village. It
shall be the policy to establish stormwater service charges in such amount
in order to pay for all or a part of the following costs relating to the
Utility: operation and maintenance (O&M); administrative; contributions to
a replacement and capital improvement fund; and debt service, including
debt retirement, debt service reserves and coverage requirements. The
Board may establish and modify stormwater service charges as necessary
so as to assure that the charges generate adequate revenues to pay the
costs of the stormwater management program and that costs are allocated
fairly and proportionately to all parcels in the Village.
§ 326-8. Charges.
Stormwater service charges may include the following components:
§ 326-9. Customer classification.
A. User charge. A user charge may be imposed on all property that has
impervious surface area. The charge to each parcel shall be based upon
the number of ERUs assigned to the parcel. The user charge for each
parcel shall be equal to the product of the user charge rate in terms of
dollars per ERU and the number of ERU's assigned to the parcel.
B. Special charge. A special charge may be imposed on property that is in
an area specially benefited by a particular stormwater management
facility. This charge will be developed to reflect the benefits in a
particular area that may not be appropriate to allocate to property
throughout the Village.
C. All stormwater service charge rates shall be established from time to
time by resolution of the Village Board and set forth in a Stormwater
Utility Rate Table attached thereto.
A. For purposes of imposing the user charges, all lots and parcels in the
Village shall be classified into the following five customer
classifications:
(1) Single-family and duplex residential.
(2) Condominium residential.
(3) Multifamily residential.
(4) Nonresidential.
(5) Undeveloped.
§ 326-7 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 326-9
326:421
B. ERU's shall be calculated for each classification as follows:
(1) Single-family and duplex residential: one ERU per dwelling unit.
(2) Condominium residential. The Village Manager shall be
responsible for determining the total impervious area of each
condominium parcel based on the best available information,
including, but not limited to, data supplied by the Village Engineer,
Village Assessor, Building Inspector or Planning and Zoning
Administrator, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant or
developer or actual on-site measurement. The total impervious
area of the parcel shall be divided equally among the condominium
units to determine the square feet of impervious area per unit. This
amount shall be divided by the number of square feet per ERU as
established by the Village Board and set forth in the Stormwater
Utility Rate Table to determine the number of ERUs to assign to
each unit, except that in no case shall a condominium unit be
assigned less than 0.5 ERUs. The number of ERUs per unit shall be
rounded to the nearest 0.5 ERUs.
(3) Multifamily residential. The Village Manager shall be responsible
for determining the impervious area of each multifamily residential
parcel based on the best available information, including, but not
limited to, data supplied by the Village Engineer, Village Assessor,
Building Inspector or Planning and Zoning Administrator, aerial
photography, the property owner, tenant or developer or actual onsite
measurement. The total impervious area of the parcel shall be
divided by the number of square feet per ERU as established by the
Village Board and set forth in a Stormwater Utility Rate Table to
determine the number of ERUs, except that in no case shall a
multifamily parcel be assigned less than 0.50 ERUs per dwelling
unit. The number of ERUs shall be rounded to the nearest 0.50
ERUs.
(4) Nonresidential property. The Village Manager shall be responsible
for determining the impervious area of each nonresidential parcel
based on the best available information, including, but not limited
to, data supplied by the Village Engineer, Village Assessor, Building
Inspector or Planning and Zoning Administrator, aerial
photography, the property owner, tenant or developer or actual onsite
measurement. The total impervious area of the parcel shall be
divided by the number of square feet per ERU as established by the
Village Board and set forth in a Stormwater Utility Rate Table to
determine the number of ERUs to assign to the parcel. The number
of ERUs per parcel shall be rounded to the nearest 0.50 ERUs.
(5) Undeveloped property. For any lot or parcel that has no impervious
surface area, no ERUs shall be assigned for purposes of imposing
user charges under this chapter.
§ 326-9 ELM GROVE CODE § 326-9
326:422
§ 326-10. Determination of stormwater service charges.
The amount of the charge to be imposed for each classification shall be
made by resolution of the Village Board. The current rates will be set forth
in a Stormwater Utility Rate Table and kept on file in the office of the Village
Clerk. The rates shall be reviewed by the Village Board on an annual basis
and adjusted as necessary.
§ 326-11. Billing and payment.
§ 326-12. Appeals.
C. New construction. For all classifications other than single-family and
duplex residential, the construction of new or expanded buildings,
driveways or other structures shall be subject to an increase in the
number of ERUs assigned to a lot or parcel. The Village shall
recalculate the number of ERUs upon completion of new construction.
A. User charges for residential users shall be billed in advance on an
annual basis. All commercial users shall be billed on a quarterly basis.
Payment of commercial bills shall be made within 25 days of mailing by
the Village. In the event that such bill is not paid when due, a penalty of
1.5% per month on the unpaid balance shall be added thereto. All bills
shall be payable at the office of the Village Treasurer, 13600 Juneau
Boulevard, Elm Grove, Wisconsin 53122.
B. The property owner is held responsible for all stormwater service
charges on real property that s/he or it owns. All stormwater bills and
notices of any nature relative to the stormwater management program
will be addressed to the owner and delivered to the addressee by first
class mail.
C. Reasonable care will be exercised in the delivery of stormwater service
charges bills. A failure to receive a stormwater service charges bill,
however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility for payment
of stormwater service charges within the prescribed period nor exempt
any party from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment
thereof.
D. Unpaid stormwater service charges shall be a lien upon the property
served and shall be enforced as provided in § 66.0809(3), Wis. Stats.
A. The stormwater service charge, a determination of ERUs or ERU
credits may be appealed by filing a written appeal with the Village
Manager prior to the due date if not paid or within 30 days of payment.
The appeal shall specify all bases for the challenge and the amount of
the stormwater service charge the appellant asserts is appropriate.
Failure to timely file an appeal waives all right to contest such charge.
B. The Village Manager shall determine whether the stormwater charge is
fair and reasonable or whether an adjustment or refund is due the
§ 326-9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 326-12
326:423
appellant. The Village Manager may act with or without a hearing and
shall inform the appellant in writing of his or her decision.
C. The appellant has 30 days from the decision of the Village Manager to
file a written appeal to the Village Board. The written appeal shall
specify all grounds constituting the basis of the appeal of the Village
Manager's decision and shall again state the amount of the charge that
the appellant considers to be appropriate. The appeal must specifically
address the determination of the Village Manager.
D. The Village Board shall review said written appeal and shall determine
whether the stormwater charge is fair and reasonable or whether an
adjustment or refund is due the appellant. The Village Clerk shall
provide five business days' prior written notice of the time and place of
the Board's consideration of the appeal to the owner at the address
listed in the appeal. The Board shall base its decision on the record
submitted to it at its meeting. The Village Clerk shall notify the
appellant in writing of the Board's determination by first class mail
addressed to the owner using the address listed in the appeal.
E. If as a result of any appeal a refund is due the owner, such refund shall
be applied as a credit on the owner's next stormwater charge bill.

or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
[Amended 2-24-2014; 10-27-2014]
B. Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts
are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 Zones on the maps based on
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below and the revisions in the
Village of Elm Grove Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the Base
Flood Elevations (BFEs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by
the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process before it
is effective. No changes to Regional Flood Elevations (RFEs) on non-
FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps
and revisions are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator,
Village of Elm Grove. If more than one map or revision is referenced,
the most restrictive information shall apply. [Amended 6-24-2008;

Village of Elm Grove Flood Storage District, Panel 4 of 12. Dated
November 5, 2014. Prepared and approved by the DNR.
C. Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain
areas are divided into four districts defined in Article X and as follows:
[Amended 10-27-2014]
(1) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to
carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones
as shown on the FIRM.
(2) The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain
between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as
AE Zones on the FIRM.
(3) The Flood Storage District (FSD) consists of those areas of the
floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the
regional flood discharge.
(4) The General Floodplain District (GFP) consists of those areas that
may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does
§ 330-5 ELM GROVE CODE § 330-5
326:428
not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH
and AO Zones of the FIRM.
D. Locating floodplain boundaries.
(1) Discrepancies between boundaries on the official Floodplain
Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the
criteria in Subsection D(1)(a) or (b) below. If a significant difference
exists, the map shall be amended according to Article VIII. The
Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile
elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map
amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be
responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field
conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was
determined and for initiating any map amendments required under
this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an
applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according
to § 330-26C and the criteria below. Where flood profiles are based
on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must
approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Article VIII.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations
shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base
flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator using the
scale appearing on the map.
(2) Where there is a significant difference between the map and actual
field conditions, the map shall be amended. Where a map
amendment has been approved by both the Elm Grove Board of
Trustees and the Department, the Zoning Administrator shall have
the authority to grant or deny a land use permit.
E. Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain
unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood
elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the Floodplain District,
and the map is amended pursuant to Article VIII. To remove flood
insurance requirements, FEMA must first revise the Flood Insurance
Rate Map or issue a letter of map amendment or revision.
F. Compliance. Any development, as defined in Article X, or use within the
areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable local, Wis. State, and federal
regulations.
G. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, the Village of Elm Grove is required to comply with
this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are
required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction,
§ 330-5 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 330-5
326:429
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges
by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when
§ 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
H. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(1) This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under § 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties;
§ 62.23 for cities; or § 61.35 for villages; or § 87.30, Wis. Stats.,
which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive
than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(2) This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail.
I. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor
of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall
be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the
adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text
amendment to this chapter.
J. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in
this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific
research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased
by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or
guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be
free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create
liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result
from reliance on this chapter.
K. Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.27
27.Editor's Note: Former Subsection L, General development standards, which immediately
followed, was repealed 10-27-2014.

C. Standards for development. Article III applies to Floodway areas.
Article IV applies to Flood-Fringe areas. The rest of this chapter applies
to either district.
(1) In AO/AH Zones, the structure's lowest floor must meet one of the
conditions listed below, whichever is higher.
(a) At or above the flood protection elevation; or
(b) Two feet above the highest adjacent grade around the
structure; or
(c) The depth as shown on the FIRM.
D. Determine Floodway and Flood-Fringe limits. Upon receiving an
application for development within the General Floodplain District, the
Zoning Administrator shall:
(1) Require the applicant to submit two copies of an aerial photograph
or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to
the General Floodplain District limits, stream channel, and existing
floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the
property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and
floodproofing measures; and the flood zone as shown on the FIRM.
(2) Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information
deemed necessary by the Department to evaluate the effects of the
proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation
and to determine floodway boundaries.

§ 330-16 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 330-16
326:441
§ 330-17. Flood Storage District.
The Flood Storage District delineates that portion of the floodplain where
storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to
reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage
areas and will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would
cause higher flood elevations.
§ 330-18. through § 330-19. (Reserved)
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size,
location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on
the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and
sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information;
(c) Specification for building construction and materials,
floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage,
water supply and sanitary facilities.
A. Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the
Flood Storage District (FSD), as shown on the official floodplain zoning
maps.
B. Permitted uses. Any use or development which occurs in a Flood
Storage District must meet the applicable requirements of § 330-15.
C. Standards for development in Flood Storage Districts.
(1) Development in a Flood Storage District shall not cause an increase
equal or greater than 0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional
flood.
(2) No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage
volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the predevelopment
ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall
be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to
compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory
storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered
to provide an equal volume of storage.
(3) If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be
developed unless the entire area zoned as Flood Storage District,
on this waterway, is rezoned to the Flood-Fringe District. This must
include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the
waterway to revise to the high flood discharge calculated without
floodplain storage, as per Article VIII of this chapter.
(4) No area may be removed from the Flood Storage District unless it
can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection
elevation and is contiguous to other lands outside the floodplain.

ARTICLE VI
Nonconforming Uses
§ 330-20. Applicability and continuance.
A. Applicability. If these standards conform with § 59.69(10), Wis. Stats.,
for counties or § 62.23(7)(h), Wis. Stats., for cities and villages, they
shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or
structure and to the use of any structure or premises that was lawful
before the passage of this chapter or any amendment thereto.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abrogate the requirements
for nonconforming structures set forth in § 335-51 or any other
provision of the Village Code of Ordinances. [Amended 2-24-2014]
C. The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use that is not in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue, subject to
the following conditions:
(1) No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure
shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter and all
municipal ordinances. As used in this chapter, the words
"modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any
alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or
replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory
structure or use. Maintenance is not considered a modification; this
includes painting, decorating, paneling and the replacing of other
nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or
replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or
connections to public utilities. The repair of a damaged structure is
not considered maintenance. For purposes of this chapter, the
construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and
that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an
extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may
extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress
and egress to the principal structure. [Amended 2-24-2014]
(2) If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted,
and any future use of the property, and any structure or building
thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this
chapter and all municipal ordinances.
(3) As requests are received by the Village for modifications or
additions to nonconforming uses or nonconforming structures, the
Village shall keep a record that lists the nonconforming uses and

substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term
does not however, include either any project for the improvement of
a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code
violations identified by the Building Inspector and/or Zoning
Administrator, and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designated as an
historic structure.[Added 2-24-2014]

General Provisions
§ 335-1. Statutory authority.
This chapter is adopted under the authority granted by §§ 61.35, 61.351,
62.23(7), 87.30, 144.26,31 and 236.45, Wis. Stats., and amendments thereto.
The Village Board of the Village of Elm Grove does ordain as follows.
§ 335-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known as, referred to and cited as the "Zoning
Ordinance, Village of Elm Grove, Wisconsin" and is hereinafter referred to
as the "chapter."
§ 335-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the comfort, health, safety,
morals, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of the Village of Elm
Grove, Wisconsin.
§ 335-4. Intent.
It is the general intent of this chapter to regulate and restrict the use of all
structures, lands and waters and to:
A. Regulate lot coverage and the size and location of all structures so as to
prevent overcrowding and to provide adequate sunlight, air, sanitation
and drainage;
B. Regulate population density and distribution so as to avoid sprawl or
undue concentration and to facilitate the provision of adequate public
service and utilities;
C. Regulate parking, loading and access so as to lessen congestion in and
promote the safety and efficiency of streets and highways;
D. Secure safety from fire, flooding, pollution, contamination and other
dangers;
E. Stabilize and protect existing and potential property values;
F. Preserve and protect the beauty of the Village of Elm Grove;
G. Prevent and control erosion, sedimentation and other pollution of the
surface and subsurface waters;

§ 335-1 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-4
326:477
§ 335-5. Affect on existing provisions; greater restrictions to apply.
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or
interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, ordinances, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted
or issued pursuant to law. However, wherever this chapter imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.
§ 335-6. Interpretation of provisions.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the Village and shall not be construed to be a limitation or repeal of
any other power now possessed by the Village of Elm Grove.
§ 335-7. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection provided by this chapter is believed to be
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering experience
and scientific methods of study. On unpredictable, but rare occasions, larger
floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted by debris.
Therefore, no part of this chapter is intended to imply that areas outside of
the delineated floodplain or land uses permitted within the floodplain will
be totally free from flooding and the associated flood damages. This chapter
is not intended to create a liability on the part of or a cause of action against
the Village of Elm Grove or any office or employee thereof for any flood
damages that may result from reliance on this chapter.
J. Further the maintenance of safe and healthful water conditions;
K. Protect the traffic-carrying capacity of existing and proposed arterial
streets and highways;
L. Implement those municipal, county, watershed and regional
comprehensive plans or components of such plans adopted by the
Village of Elm Grove;
M. Provide for the administration and enforcement of this chapter; and
N. Provide penalties for the violation of this chapter.

Applicability; General Use Regulations
§ 335-8. Jurisdiction.
The jurisdiction of this chapter shall apply to all structures, lands, water, air,
and air space within the corporate limits of the Village of Elm Grove.
§ 335-9. Compliance required.
No structure, land, water or air shall hereafter be used or developed, and
no structure or part thereof shall hereafter be located, erected, moved,
reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted or substantially improved
without full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other
applicable local, county, state and federal regulations.
§ 335-10. Compliance by governmental units.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all governmental units are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all required permits. State agencies
are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by
the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt from compliance
when § 30.12(4)(a), Wis. Stats., applies.
§ 335-11. Permitted uses. [Amended 7-22-2003; 4-26-2005]
Only the following uses and their essential services may be allowed in any
district.
A. Principal uses specified for a district.
B. Accessory uses and structures are permitted as specified within the
individual districts, but not until the principal structure is present or
under construction.
C. Accessory structures in the nature of yard maintenance buildings.
(1) Preamble. It is the Village's opinion that, in general, yard
maintenance buildings located on or near property lines detract
from the overall ambience that makes Elm Grove unique. Therefore
it is the Village's strong preference that, if residents feel that a yard
maintenance building is necessary, the yard maintenance building
be designed to match and be located next to the principal structure
or garage.
(2) Conditions and restrictions. Accessory structures in the nature of
yard maintenance buildings used for the storage of garden and
cultivating tools, lawn mowers, snow blowers, yard maintenance
equipment, pool equipment and similar tools and supplies shall be
allowed to be erected subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:
§ 335-8 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-11
326:479
(a) All such structures shall be approved by the Building Board
only after application has been made on forms provided by the
Village.
(b) A permit fee shall be required for each permit as determined
from time to time by the Village Board.
(c) Any such proposed structure shall be approved by the Building
Board pursuant to criteria in § 335-88D(6)(c).
(d) No existing yard maintenance building shall be structurally
altered or structurally repaired without obtaining a building
permit and complying with all applicable provisions of the
Village Code including, but not limited to, § 335-88D(6)(c).
D. Conditional uses and their accessory uses are considered as special
uses requiring review, public hearing, and approval by the Village Plan
Commission in accordance with § 335-86 of this chapter. When a use is
classified as a conditional use at the date of adoption of this chapter, it
shall be considered a legal use without further action of the Village.
Changes to or substitution of conditional uses shall be subject to review
and approval by the Plan Commission in accordance with § 335-86 of
this chapter.
E. Uses not specified in this chapter as permitted uses are hereby
declared to be prohibited. Unspecified uses that are similar in character
to principal uses permitted in the district may be permitted by the Plan
Commission upon a finding by the Plan Commission that the desired use
is not contrary to the intent of the district and that such use will not
otherwise violate any provisions of this chapter.
F. Temporary uses, such as real estate sales field offices or shelters for
materials and equipment being used in the construction of a permanent
structure, may be permitted by the Plan Commission.
G. No animals other than household pets shall be kept or raised, and no
kennels or hutches shall be maintained in the Village of Elm Grove.
H. Performance standards listed in Article VIII of this chapter shall be met
with respect to all uses in any district.
I. Preclusion of transient commercial use of residential property in
certain zoning districts. [Added 12-19-2016]
(1) Precluding transient commercial use of residential property in the
Village's Rs-1, Rs-2, Rs-3, Rs-4 and Rm-1 Zoning Districts is found
to be and deemed essential to the character, general health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the Village. The goals advanced with
the preclusion of transient commercial use of residential property
are:
(a) Avoidance of vehicular traffic that is greater than normally
expected in the residential neighborhood.
§ 335-11 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-11
326:480
(b) Prevention of excessive noise, fumes, glare and vibrations
generated during the use of the residential neighborhood.
(c) Reduction of the commercial use of residential property to
maintain residential property values.
(d) Avoidance of the intensification of parking problems within
residential property districts.
(e) Encouragement of a more permanent population within
residential property districts that facilitates and contributes to
the more effective delivery of public safety services.
(f) Reduction of public safety problems within residential property
districts.
(2) Definitions. For the purpose of this § 335-11I, the following words
and phrases shall have the following definitions:

located within a zoning district or underlying zoning district, in
conjunction with a Planned Development Overlay District,
consisting of the following zoning districts: Rs-1, Rs-2, Rs-3, Rs-4
or Rm-1.
TRANSIENT COMMERCIAL USE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY
 Any use of residential property for which remuneration is
exchanged, such as compensation, money, rent or other bargainedfor
consideration given in return for occupancy, possession or use
of real property and where the term of occupancy, possession or
tenancy of the property by any person allowed such occupancy,
possession or tenancy is less than 30 consecutive calendar days.
VILLAGE  The Village of Elm Grove, Wisconsin.
(3) The Transient Commercial Use of Residential Property by a natural
person or family is prohibited. Any property owner or natural
person or family who engages in acts contrary to this prohibition
shall be subject to prosecution.
(4) Penalty.
(a) Any person found guilty of violating § 335-11I, notwithstanding
the general penalty provision contained in § 1-16 of this Code,
upon conviction thereof shall forfeit not less than $150 or no
more than 200% of the compensation of value received by the
party in violation of this section for each such offense, together
with the costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of
such forfeiture and costs, shall be subject to the alternate
penalties provided for in Wis. Stats. § 800.095.
§ 335-11 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-11
326:481
§ 335-12. Site regulations. [Amended 11-25-2003]
No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for
such use or structure by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate
drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or loadbearing
strength, erosion susceptibility or any other feature likely to be
harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of
this community. The Village Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of
this section, shall, in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases
its conclusion that the land is not suitable for certain uses. The applicant
shall have an opportunity to present evidence contesting such unsuitability
if he/she so desires. Thereafter the Village Plan Commission may affirm,
modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
(b) Each violation and each day or fraction thereof a violation
continues or occurs shall constitute a separate offense.
(c) Nothing in this Code shall preclude the Village from
maintaining any action, including, but not limited to, injunctive
relief, to abate, prevent, or remove a violation of any provision
of this Code.
(d) Whenever any person fails to pay any forfeiture and costs of
prosecution as ordered by a court, such person shall be subject
to the alternate penalties provided for in Wis. Stats. § 800.095
from time to time.
A. All lots shall abut upon a public street or have other Village-approved
access.
B. All principal structures shall be located on a lot and only one principal
structure shall be located, erected or moved onto a lot in all residential
districts. The Plan Commission may permit more than one structure per
lot in other districts where more than one principal structure is needed
for the orderly development of the parcel. When additional structures
are permitted, the Plan Commission may impose additional yard
requirements, landscaping requirements or parking requirements, or
may require a minimum separation distance between principal
structures.
C. Lot coverage. Maximum lot coverage by all buildings and impervious
surfaces shall be set forth in the individual district regulations in
§ 335-17 through § 335-26 or as modified by a planned development
overlay approval under § 335-30. Three percent may be added to the
total maximum impervious surface coverage for an individual district
through the use of permeable surfaces. However, the total amount of
impervious surface may not exceed the square footage that would
otherwise be permitted in the underlying zoning district. [Added
3-24-2014]
§ 335-11 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-12
326:482
(1) Any lot that utilizes permeable surface to exceed the maximum
allowable impervious surface area for its zoning district shall be
required to submit a construction and site plan that includes the
following items:
(a) A survey map and grading plan that indicates the location and
size of the area of permeable surfacing.
(b) Specifications and design for permeable surface materials,
substrate base, hydraulic design and soil conditions.
(c) An installation plan for the project.
(d) An operation and maintenance plan that is consistent with the
manufacturer's original permeability specifications.
(2) Use of permeable surface materials to exceed the maximum lot
coverage area for the underlying zoning district is considered a
conditional use and requires a conditional use permit as set forth
under § 335-86.
D. No building permit shall be issued for a lot which abuts a public street
dedicated to only a portion of its proposed width and located on that
side thereof from which the required dedication has not been secured.
E. Lots abutting more restrictive district boundaries shall provide side and
rear yards not less than those required in the more restrictive abutting
district. The setbacks on the less restrictive district shall be modified
for a distance of not more than 60 feet from the district boundary line so
as to equal the average of the street yards required in both districts.
F. Buffer yard required. Any business or industrial use that abuts a
residential parcel shall provide a minimum buffer yard of 20 feet
between the business use and all single-family and two-family
residential districts. The purpose of the buffer yard is to screen the
business activity or multifamily residential activity from the single- or
two-family residential environment in such a manner that:
(1) If a buffer yard is composed entirely of plant materials, it shall be of
sufficient depth and height and contain sufficient plant species as
to provide dense visual screening within two years and during all
seasons of the year.
(2) Where architectural walls or fences are used, sufficient
landscaping shall be used in conjunction with such wall or fence to
create an attractive view from the residential side. Any wall or
fence shall not be less than four nor more than six and one-half feet
in height and shall comply with the requirements set forth for
fences in § 335-88D(8)(g) of this chapter.
(3) Pursuant to § 335-32G, all public off-street parking areas which
abut single-family residential development shall be provided with a
continuous screen consisting of either dense landscaping or a wall
§ 335-12 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-12
326:483
of appropriate height, sufficiently opaque to prevent the
penetration of headlight glare.
(4) All landscaping shall be maintained by the owner or operator to the
satisfaction of the Building Board.
(5) No lighting shall be permitted on or in any part of the buffer yard,
and no lighting installed elsewhere on the parcel shall direct any
rays onto adjacent residential properties.
(6) No signs shall be permitted on or in any part of the buffer yard.
G. Downtown Overlay District site design guidelines.
(1) Findings. The Village recognizes the importance of a vital central
business district, not only in terms of economic value but also as an
essential expectation of Village residents. The village finds that the
maintenance of a traditional "Village Center" theme within a
recognized Downtown Design Overlay District, incorporating
elements of neighborhood compatibility, land use diversity,
pedestrian-friendly design, empathetic building placement, use of
high quality materials and consideration for public safety, will
address existing and future needs and will best promote public
health, safety, order, commerce, and general welfare and will
encourage efficiency and economy in the process of development.
(2) Authority. Pursuant to the provisions of Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23(2) and
61.34(1), the Village hereby adopts the Downtown District Site
Design Guidelines (also known as the "Downtown Design
Guidelines"), dated July 2, 2003, and revised on August 7, 2003, as
a stand-alone component of its Zoning Code which shall also serve
to augment any Village master plan. Pursuant to Wis. Stats.
§ 66.035,32 the Village Board of Elm Grove hereby elects to enact
this section as part of the Zoning Code. This shall be accomplished
by referencing the Downtown District Site Design Guidelines
through its publication solely in pamphlet form without any
publication in conformity with Wis. Stats. § 61.50(1), provided a
copy of such pamphlet has first been made available for public
inspection in the office of the Clerk for a period no less than two
weeks before its enactment and thereafter remain permanently on
file for such purpose. Said Downtown District Site Design
Guidelines may be amended from time to time.
(3) Downtown Design Overlay District boundaries. The boundaries of
the Downtown Design Overlay District are hereby established as
shown on the map entitled "Downtown Design Overlay District,"
Village of Elm Grove, Wisconsin, dated May 23, 2003, and revised
on August 7, 2003; which map accompanies and is hereby made a
part of this chapter.33 Said map may be amended from time to time.
32.Editor's Note: Section 66.035, Wis. Stats., was repealed by 1999 Act 150, § 86, effective
1-1-2001.
§ 335-12 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-12
326:484
§ 335-13. Reduction or joint use of required space.
No lot, yard, parking area, building area or other space shall be reduced in
area or dimensions so as not to meet the provisions of this chapter. No part
of any lot, yard, parking area or other space required for a structure or use
shall be used for any other structure or use.
§ 335-14. Division or combination of residential land.
Because the Village is almost fully developed, with all residential lands
being either a part of platted subdivisions or defined through existing
metes-and-bounds legal descriptions, and because the Village is satisfied
that the resulting development, density and land uses generally provide the
highest and best use of residential land in the Village:
(4) Scope. This enactment of Downtown District Site Design
Guidelines and Downtown Design Overlay District boundaries shall
not repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, interfere or supercede any
existing zoning ordinances, permits, easements, covenants, or
agreements between parties or permits previously issued;
provided, however, that where the Downtown District Site Design
Guidelines in any way impose standards not required by other
existing zoning ordinances, permits, easements, covenants or
agreements, the provisions of the Downtown District Site Design
Guidelines shall be used to supplement them.
(5) Purpose. The general purpose of the Downtown District Site Design
Guidelines is to assist the Village staff, Plan Commission and
Building Board in reviewing proposed improvements within the
Downtown Design Overlay District boundaries to enhance the
visual character of the Downtown Design Overlay District and
avoid monotony. These guidelines are intended to foster sound,
attractive, functional and quality development. The guidelines shall
be liberally construed in favor of the Village of Elm Grove and shall
be considered minimum standards.
A. Lots existing on the effective date of this chapter shall not be divided
except, with the approval of the Plan Commission and pursuant to all
applicable laws and ordinances then in effect, provided that all
minimum zoning requirements are satisfied. In granting approval, the
Plan Commission may consider the size and shape of the lots in close
proximity to the lot to be divided, the size and shape of the lots resulting
from the proposed division and any deed or other restriction applicable
to the lot proposed to be divided.
33.Editor's Note: For informational purposes, a copy of the map and pamphlet version of the
Downtown District Site Design Guidelines, dated July 2, 2003, and revised on August 7,
2003, is located in the office of the Village Clerk and may be examined there during
regular office hours.
§ 335-12 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-14
326:485
B. Lots existing on the effective date of this chapter shall not be combined
to create a larger lot except with the approval of the Plan Commission;
such larger lot shall not thereafter be divided.

M-1 Limited Manufacturing District
I-1 Institutional District
G-1 Governmental District
W-1 Wetland District
FWO Floodway Overlay District
FFO Floodland Fringe Overlay District
PDO Planned Development Overlay District
A. Boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on the
map entitled "Zoning Map--Village of Elm Grove, Wisconsin," dated
April 9, 2000; which map accompanies and is herewith made a part of
this chapter.34 Such boundaries shall be construed to follow: corporate
limits; U. S. Public Land Survey lines; lot or property lines; center lines
of streets, highways, alleys, easements and railroad rights-of-way or
such lines extended; unless otherwise noted on the Zoning Map.
B. Boundaries of the W-1 Wetland District were based on the Wisconsin
Wetland Inventory Map for the Village of Elm Grove, dated December
16, 1987, and stamped "FINAL," and include, but are not limited to, all
shoreland wetlands five acres or more in area, shown on those maps.35
C. Boundaries of the Floodland Districts are hereby established as shown
on the map entitled, "Supplementary Floodland Zoning Map ---Village of

floodway conditions, contained on the Supplementary Floodland Zoning
Map were developed from technical data contained in the Flood
Insurance Study--Village of Elm Grove, Waukesha County, Wisconsin,
published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
and dated January 19, 1982. The information contained in the flood
insurance study is further illustrated on the FEMA Flood Boundary and
Floodway Map and Flood Insurance Rate Map, both maps dated July 19,
1982. Where a conflict exists between the floodland limits as shown on
the Supplementary Flood Zoning Map and actual field conditions, the
elevations from the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood profile
shall be the governing factor in locating the regulatory floodland limits.
D. Vacation of public streets and alleys shall cause the land vacated to be
automatically placed in the same district as the abutting side to which
the vacated land reverts.
A. Permitted principal uses.
(1) Single-family dwellings with attached garages.

37.24CFR 100.303 (April 1, 2015) 62 or over housing. (a) The provisions regarding familial
status in this part shall not apply to housing intended for, and solely occupied by, persons
62 years of age or older. Housing satisfies the requirements of this section even though:
(1) There are persons residing in such housing on September 13, 1988 who are under 62
years of age, provided that all new occupants are persons 62 years of age or older; (2)
There are unoccupied units, provided that such units are reserved for occupancy by
persons 62 years of age or over; (3) There are units occupied by employees of the housing
(and family members residing in the same unit) who are under 62 years of age provided
they perform substantial duties directly related to the management or maintenance of the
housing. (b) The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a) of this
section: Example (1): John and Mary apply for housing at the Vista Heights apartment
complex which is an elderly housing complex operated for persons 62 years of age or
older. John is 62 years of age. Mary is 59 years of age. If Vista Heights wishes to retain its
"62 or over" exemption it must refuse to rent to John and Mary because Mary is under 62
years of age. However, if Vista Heights does rent to John and Mary, it might qualify for the
"55 or over" exemption in § 100.304. Example (2): The Blueberry Hill retirement
community has 100 dwelling units. On September 13, 1988, 15 units were vacant and 35
units were occupied with at least one person who is under 62 years of age. The remaining
50 units were occupied by persons who were all 62 years of age or older. Blueberry Hill
can qualify for the "62 or over" exemption as long as all units that were occupied after
September 13, 1988 are occupied by persons who were 62 years of age or older. The
people under 62 in the 35 units previously described need not be required to leave for
Blueberry Hill to qualify for the "62 or over" exemption.

(c) Ditching, excavating, dredging, dike and dam construction
may be done in wildlife refuges, game preserves and private
wildlife habitat areas, but only for the purpose of improving
wildlife habitat or to otherwise enhance wetland values.
(3) The construction and maintenance of electric, gas, telephone,
water and sewer transmission and distribution lines and related
facilities by public utilities and cooperative associations organized
for the purpose of producing or furnishing heat, light, power or
water to members, provided that:
(a) The transmission and distribution lines and related facilities
cannot, as a practical matter, be located outside of a wetland;
and
(b) Any filling, excavating, ditching or draining that is to be done
must be necessary for such construction or maintenance and
must be done is a manner designed to minimize flooding and
other adverse impacts upon the natural functions of the
wetlands.
(4) The construction and maintenance of railroad lines, provided that:
(a) The railroad lines cannot, as a practical matter, be located
outside of a wetland; and
(b) Any filling, excavating, ditching or draining that is to be done
must be necessary for such construction or maintenance and
must be done in a manner designed to minimize flooding and
other adverse impacts upon the natural functions of the
wetlands.
D. Prohibited uses.
§ 335-27 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-27
326:519
(1) Any use not listed as a permitted use or a conditional use is
prohibited unless the W-1 District lands concerned are first rezoned
into another district.
(2) The use of a boathouse for human habitation and the construction
or placement of a boathouse or fixed houseboat below the ordinary
high-water mark of any navigable water are prohibited.
E. Wetland mapping discrepancies. Whenever a discrepancy exists
between the boundary of a wetland, as shown in the W-1 Wetland
District, and actual field conditions, the Village shall contact the
Southeast District Office of the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) to determine if the wetland delineation is in error. If
the DNR staff concurs that an area has been incorrectly mapped as a
wetland, the Village shall have the authority to immediately grant or
deny a permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the
correct zoning district. The Village shall then take appropriate action to
amend the Zoning Map within a reasonable period of time.
F. Amendment procedure.
(1) Notice to DNR. The Village shall transmit a notice of any change
(text or map) in the W-1 District, if such change affects land in the
shoreland, to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). Notice requirements shall be as follows:
(a) A copy of every petition for a text or map change mailed within
five days of filing with the Village Clerk.
(b) At least 10 days' prior notice of any public hearing on a
shoreland W-1 zoning amendment.
(c) Notice of a Village Plan Commission recommendation no later
than 10 days following the recommendation.
(d) Notice of a Village Board decision no later than 10 days
following the decision.
(2) Review standards. No wetland in a shoreland W-1 District shall be
rezoned if the rezoning may result in a significant adverse impact
on stormwater or floodwater storage capacity; maintenance of dry
season streamflow, the discharge of groundwater from the wetland
to another area or the flow of groundwater through a wetland;
filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic
compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
shoreline protection against soil erosion; fish spawning, breeding,
nursery or feeding grounds; wildlife habitat; or areas of special
recreational, scenic or scientific interest, including scarce wetland
types.
(3) DNR objections. If the DNR has notified the Village Plan
Commission that an amendment to the shoreland portion of the W-1
§ 335-27 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-27
326:520
§ 335-28. FWO Floodway Overlay District.
District may have a significant adverse impact upon any of the
criteria listed in Subsection F(2) above, that amendment, if
approved by the Village Board, shall contain the following
provision:
"This amendment shall not take effect until more than 30 days
have elapsed since written notice of the Village Board's approval
of this amendment was mailed to the Department of Natural
Resources. During that 30-day period, the Department of Natural
Resources may notify the Village Board that it will adopt a
superseding shoreland ordinance for the Village pursuant to
Section 61.351 of the Wisconsin Statutes. If the Department does
so notify the Village Board, the effect of this amendment shall be
stayed until the Section 61.351 adoption procedure is completed
or otherwise terminated."
G. Protest. In the event of a protest against such district change or
amendment to the regulations of this chapter, duly signed and
acknowledged by the owners of 20% or more either of the areas of the
land included in such proposed change, or by the owners of 20% or
more of the land immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or
by the owners of 20% or more of the land directly opposite thereto
extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land, such
changes or amendments shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of 3/4 of the Village Board members voting on the
proposed change.
A. Intent; conflicting provisions.
(1) The FWO Floodway Overlay District is intended to be used to
protect people and property from flood damage by prohibiting the
erection of structures that would impede the flow of water during
periodic flooding. Permitting use of the floodway would increase
damages in the broader floodplain by increasing flood stages. In
delineating the FWO District, the effects of development within the
associated flood fringe shall be computed. No increase in flood
stage shall be permitted that is equal to or greater than 0.01 foot
unless the Village has made appropriate legal arrangements with
all affected units of government and all property owners affected by
the stage increase and until the Village and all affected units of
government have amended their water surface profiles and
floodland zoning maps to reflect the increased flood elevations. No
floodway overlay district changes shall be permitted where the
cumulative effect of changes increases flood stages more than 1.0
foot. In addition to floodway delineated by detailed engineering
methods, any unnumbered A Zones which appear on the Village's
Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be placed in the FWO Floodway
Overlay District.
§ 335-27 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-28
326:521
(2) Overlay districts provide for the possibility of superimposing
certain additional requirements upon a basic underlying zoning
district without disturbing the requirements of the basic district. In
the instance of conflicting requirements, the stricter of the
conflicting requirements shall apply.
(3) Where there are conflicts between this section and the Floodplain
Ordinance,44 the Floodplain Ordinance shall take precedence.
B. Permitted uses.
(1) Drainage.
(2) Movement of floodwater.
(3) Navigation.
(4) Stream bank protection.
(5) Water measurement and control facilities.
(6) Any of the following uses are permitted, provided that they are
permitted uses in the district immediately adjacent to the floodway,
and further provided that such use shall not involve the erecting or
placing of a structure.
(a) Grazing.
(b) Horticulture.
(c) Open parking and loading areas, provided that such uses shall
not be subject to inundation depths greater than two feet or
flood velocities greater than two feet per second.
(d) Open recreational uses, such as parks, sport fields, beaches,
bathing, golf courses and driving ranges.
(e) Outdoor plant nurseries.
(f) Utility poles, towers and underground conduit for transmitting
electricity, telephone, cable television, natural gas, water and
sewer lines and similar products and services.
(g) Wildlife preserves.
C. Conditional uses.
(1) Open space and related uses for the following uses, provided that
the applicant shows that such use or improvement will not impede
drainage, will not cause ponding, will not obstruct the floodway,
will not increase flood flow velocities, will not increase the flood
stage and will not retard the movement of floodwaters. When
permitted, all structures shall be floodproofed and constructed so
44.Editor's Note: See Ch. 330, Floodplain Zoning.
§ 335-28 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-28
326:522
as not to catch or collect debris nor be damaged by floodwaters.
Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the Building
Inspector and shall consist of a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures
are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths and other
factors associated with the one-hundred-year recurrence interval
flood.
(a) Navigational structures.
(b) Public water measuring and control facilities.
(c) Bridges and approaches.
(d) Marinas.
(e) Filling as authorized by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources to permit the establishment of approved bulkhead
lines.
(f) Other open space uses consistent with the purpose and intent
of the district and compatible with uses in adjacent districts,
not including structures.
(2) Municipal water supply and sanitary sewage collection systems,
provided that the system is floodproofed to an elevation of at least
two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence
interval flood and is designed to eliminate or minimize infiltration
of floodwaters into the system. Certification of floodproofing shall
be made to the Building Inspector and shall consist of a plan or
document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities,
forces, depths and other factors associated with the one-hundredyear
recurrence interval flood level for the particular stream reach.
D. Dumping and filling prohibited. Lands lying within the Floodway
Overlay District shall not be used for dumping or be filled except as
authorized to permit establishment of approved bulkhead lines or to
accommodate bridge approaches. Normal earth grading activities to
permit utilization of the lands for open space, outdoor recreation, yard,
parking and similar uses are permitted.
E. Dangerous materials storage prohibited. Lands lying within the
Floodway Overlay District shall not be used for the storage of materials
that are buoyant, flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or
plant life.
F. Incompatible uses prohibited. Lands lying within the Floodway Overlay
District shall not be used for any solid waste disposal site or on-site soil
absorption sanitary sewerage system site or the construction of any
well which is used to obtain water for ultimate human consumption.
§ 335-28 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-28
326:523
§ 335-29. FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District.
Sewage treatment plants and treatment ponds shall not be constructed
in the Floodway Overlay District.
G. Maintenance of drainageways. No development in the Floodway
Overlay District shall adversely affect the channels, floodways or
shorelands of any tributary of Underwood Creek, Dousman Ditch,
drainage ditches or other lands lying outside the floodlands.
A. Intent; conflicting provisions.
(1) The FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District is intended to provide
for and encourage the most appropriate use of land and water in
areas subject to periodic flooding and to minimize flood damage to
people and property. In developing flood fringe areas,
consideration shall be given to the maintenance of flood storage
capacity and preventing significant increases in the flood
discharges identified in the Village's Flood Insurance Study. The
effects of development within the flood fringe shall be computed.
No increase in flood stage shall be permitted to exceed 0.01 foot
unless the permit applicant has made appropriate legal
arrangements with all affected units of government and all
property owners affected by the stage increase and until all such
affected units of government have amended their water surface
profiles and floodland zoning maps to reflect the increased flood
elevations. Under no circumstances shall the cumulative effect of
flood stage increases raise the regional flood profile in excess of 1.0
foot.
(2) Overlay districts provide for the possibility of superimposing
certain additional requirements upon a basic underlying zoning
district without disturbing the requirements of the basic district. In
the instance of conflicting requirements, the more strict of the
conflicting requirements shall apply.
(3) Where there are conflicts between this section and the Floodplain
Ordinance,45 the Floodplain Ordinance shall take precedence.
B. Permitted uses.
(1) Any use of land, except development involving structures, that is
permitted in the underlying basic use district. Examples of such use
would be required yards in a residential district; or parking or
loading areas in a commercial or industrial district, provided that
inundation depths for parking and loading areas do not exceed two
feet or that such areas are not subject to flood velocities greater
than two feet per second upon the occurrence of a one-hundredyear
recurrence interval flood.
45.Editor's Note: See Ch. 330, Floodplain Zoning.
§ 335-28 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-29
326:524
C. Conditional uses.
(1) Residential and commercial structures, provided that the structure
is permitted in the underlying basic use district, and provided that
such floodplain fringe areas shall be filled to an elevation at least
two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence
interval flood. Such fill shall extend for at least 15 feet beyond the
limits of the structure placed thereon. All structures shall be
provided with dryland access to lands outside the floodplain. Where
existing streets or sewer lines are at elevations which make
dryland access impractical, the Village may permit development
where access roads are at or below the one-hundred-year
recurrence interval flood stage, provided that the Village has
written assurance from appropriate police and fire departments
and emergency service agencies that rescue and relief service will
be provided to properties in the area by wheeled vehicles during a
flood event, or the Village has an adopted natural disaster plan
concurred with by the Wisconsin Division of Emergency
Government and approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources. The finished surface of the lowest floor (excluding
basement or crawlway) shall be constructed or placed at an
elevation that is at least two feet above the elevation of the onehundred-
year recurrence interval flood. Basement or crawlway
floors may be placed at the one-hundred-year recurrence interval
flood elevation, provided that the basement or crawlway is
floodproofed to the flood protection elevation. Residential
structures placed on fill may be removed from the Floodplain
Fringe Overlay District, provided that the fill is contiguous to lands
lying outside of the floodlands, and further provided that the
property owner, or his agent, has complied with all the
requirements for amending the Zoning Map as set forth in Article I
of this chapter.
(2) Industrial structures, provided that the structure is permitted in
the underlying district and provided that the fill requirements and
dryland access requirements for residential structures in the FFO
District are complied with. However, when the intent and purpose
of this chapter cannot be fulfilled by filling the floodplain fringe due
to existing and committed development, and when the Village Plan
Commission has made a finding to this effect, all new structures
and all additions to existing structures in the Floodplain Fringe
Overlay District shall be floodproofed to a point two feet above the
elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood.
Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the Building
Inspector and shall consist of a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures
are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths and other
factors associated with the one-hundred-year recurrence interval
flood level for the particular stream reach. Structures placed on fill
may be removed from the Floodplain Fringe Overlay District,
§ 335-29 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-29
326:525
provided that the fill is contiguous to lands lying outside of the
floodlands, and further provided that the property owner or his
agent has complied with all the requirements for amending the
Zoning Map as set forth in Article I of this chapter.
(3) Accessory structures, provided that the structure is not designed
for human habitation, has a low flood-damage potential, is
constructed and placed to provide minimum obstruction to flood
flows (whenever possible, accessory structures should be placed
with their longitudinal axis parallel to the flow of floodwaters), is
firmly anchored to prevent them from floating away and restricting
bridge openings and has all services facilities (such as electrical
and heating equipment) at an elevation that is at least two feet
above the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood.
(4) Municipal water supply and sanitary sewerage systems, provided
that the system is floodproofed to an elevation of at least two feet
above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence interval
flood and is designed to eliminate or minimize infiltration of
floodwaters into the system. Certification of floodproofing shall be
made to the Building Inspector and shall consist of a plan or
document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities,
forces, depths and other factors associated with the one-hundredyear
recurrence interval flood level for the particular stream reach.
(5) Filling to remove lands from the FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay
District, provided that such fill shall be to an elevation at least two
feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence
interval flood, and further provided that such lands are contiguous
to lands lying outside of the floodlands. No such Floodplain Fringe
Overlay District shall be removed from the Supplementary
Floodland Zoning Map until the filling is complete and until the
property owner, or his agent, has complied with all the
requirements for amending the Zoning Map as set forth in Article I
of this chapter.
D. Incompatible uses prohibited. Land lying within the Floodplain Fringe
Overlay District shall not be used for any solid waste disposal site, onsite
soil absorption sanitary sewerage system site or the construction of
any well which is used to obtain water for ultimate human consumption.
E. Maintenance of drainageways. No filling or development in the FFO
Floodplain Fringe Overlay District shall adversely affect the channels,
floodways or shorelands of any tributary of Underwood Creek,
Dousman Ditch, drainage ditches or other lands lying outside the
floodlands.
F. Floodland permit required. No river or stream shall be altered or
relocated until a floodland zoning change has been applied for and
granted in accordance with the requirements of this section, and until
§ 335-29 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-29
326:526
§ 335-30. Planned Development Overlay District. [Amended
5-25-2004]
all adjacent communities have been requested to review and comment
on the proposed alteration or relocation. The flood-carrying capacity
of the altered or relocated watercourse shall not be reduced to less
than the flood-carrying capacity before the watercourse was altered or
relocated.
G. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Notification. A copy of all
notices for amendments or rezoning in the Floodland Districts shall be
transmitted to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
No amendments to the floodland district boundaries or regulations shall
become effective until approved by the DNR. In the case of floodland
district boundary changes, an official letter of map amendment from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency may also be required.
A. Intent. The Planned Development Overlay District ("PDO District") is
intended to permit development, redevelopment and rehabilitation of
property through use of coordinated site planning, diversification of
location of structure location and/or types and/or through mixing of
compatible allowed uses. The PDO District is intended to achieve high
standards of planning and construction and allow for design flexibility
while, at the same time, maintaining use requirements set forth in the
underlying zoning district.
B. General provisions.
(1) A petition for unified and planned development, redevelopment
and/or rehabilitation of a site using a PDO District may encompass
one or more individual lots or structures, together with allowed
compatible uses and related accessory uses or structures
(collectively, the "project") may be approved in accordance with
this section.
(2) The Village may approve a specific petition for rezoning under this
section after a public hearing when all regulations and standards,
including but not limited to the approval, execution and recording
of a development agreement as required in § 335-30J, have been
met.
(3) All petitions for a zoning amendment establishing a PDO District
shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Plan
Commission, in making its recommendation, and by the Village
Board.
(4) The granting of a zoning amendment establishing a PDO District
shall be discretionary.
C. Allowed uses.
§ 335-29 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-30
326:527
(1) Uses allowed in a PDO District are those uses expressly provided
for as permitted, conditional and/or accessory uses in the
underlying zoning district.
(2) More than one type of use may be allowed in a PDO District if the
underlying zoning district allows such uses as permitted and/or
conditional uses.
D. Dimensional and stormwater management requirements.
(1) PDO Districts shall comply at all times with MMSD District Rules
and Regulations Chapter 13 relating to stormwater management
requirements within the underlying zoning district.
(2) PDO Districts may, however, deviate from the requirements of the
underlying zoning district with respect to maximum building
height, yard areas, lot dimensions, setbacks and parking
requirements.
(3) The density of residential units allowed in the PDO District is
subject to the provisions of § 335-30F(1).
(4) PDO Districts authorized under this section shall not contain less
than the following applicable minimum acreage for a single or
combination of parcels:
Uses Minimum Acreage
Residential PDO District 5
Commercial PDO District 5
Industrial PDO District 20
Mixed Compatible Use PDO District 20
Mixed Compatible Use within the
boundaries identified in § 335-12G(3)
1.5
Residential PDO District adjacent on at
least one complete side to a business,
office and/or manufacturing zoning
district in any municipality
1.5
E. Ownership and transfer requirements.
(1) Areas zoned as PDO Districts may be under any form of ownership
arrangement (including but not limited to the Wisconsin
Condominium Ownership Act [Wis. Stat. Ch. 703, as amended from
time to time]) provided the total completion of the project as
reflected in the development agreement approved by the Village
Board of Trustees can be guaranteed.
(2) No project or portion thereof, except a residential condominium
unit therein, shall be transferred before full completion of the
§ 335-30 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-30
326:528
obligations within the development agreement without the prior
written consent of the Village Board of Trustees.
(3) All requests for consent to transfer that are approved by the Village
Board shall be conditioned upon the deposit of financial security in
whatever form or amount deemed reasonably necessary by the
Village Board of Trustees.
(4) Individually developed lots or improvements thereon may be
transferred at any time after execution and recording of the
development agreement if allowed by the terms of the development
agreement.
F. Residential density calculations.
(1) Determination of residential density. Only one of three possible
levels of residential density shall be allowed in a specific PDO
District:
(a) The number of residential units allowed as a permitted use in
the underlying zoning district; or
(b) The number of residential units allowed as a conditional use in
the underlying zoning district, which can be less, but not more
than, a maximum total density of 12 dwelling units per net
acre; or
(c) The number of residential units allowed where an enhanced
density is allowed in recognition of a project of exceptionally
high overall quality as provided by § 335-30F(3).
(2) Density calculations involving residential use. Except as otherwise
allowed by this subsection, residential unit density in all PDO
Districts shall be calculated by considering all land encompassed
within the proposed project area.
(3) Enhanced density.
(a) If, notwithstanding dimensional differentials, a proposed
project uniformly contains exterior and interior materials,
design details, workmanship and features of an exceptionally
high quality, comparable to the highest quality tier of the
Village's then current housing stock or its best commercial
office structure, an "enhanced density" for residential units
may be recommended by the Plan Commission and may be
granted as part of the original PDO District approval process.
(b) If granted, the enhanced density level of residential use shall
be in lieu of any other possible residential density.
(c) An enhanced density shall constitute a discretionary number of
residential units that can be less than but not more than a
maximum total of 22 residential units per net acre.
§ 335-30 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-30
326:529
(d) The following criteria shall be considered by the Village Board
of Trustees in determining whether to approve an enhanced
density:
[1] Whether the project will provide better utilization of the
land and better preservation of natural resources than
would otherwise be realized if the site were developed
either in conformity with the density requirements of the
underlying district or as a PDO District without an
enhanced density;
[2] Whether the project makes adequate provision such that
an increase in residential density will not have an
unreasonable adverse effect on neighboring properties,
existing and/or proposed public rights-of-way and/or
municipal and other public services as a result of the type,
intensity and frequency of the use(s) associated with the
proposed project;
[3] Whether the structures proposed for the project are
harmonious with existing surrounding structures and land
uses.
[4] Whether building materials have been selected and are
proposed to be utilized in a manner that is harmonious
with the natural environment and the general character of
other buildings and structures in the vicinity of the
proposed development.
[5] Whether the proposed project will result in the
construction or upgrading of specific public infrastructure
improvements that will benefit the public without cost to
the Village.
[6] Whether the proposed project will enhance an existing
structure that is deemed beneficial to the character of the
neighborhood where it is situated.
(4) Mixed Compatible Use PDO District. The residential density of a
Mixed Compatible Use PDO District project shall take into account
the amount of nonresidential use in the project as follows:
(a) The average net interior square footage of all residential units
("ARU") upon completion of the project shall be calculated.
This calculation shall not, however, include utility space,
garage and areas, such as halls or other common areas, shared
by all occupants.
(b) The total interior square footage of all space devoted to
nonresidential ("TNR") uses shall be calculated. This
calculation shall not, however, include utility space, garage
areas for customer and employee parking and, where different
§ 335-30 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-30
326:530
portions of a building are owned or rented by different entities,
areas, such as halls and other common areas, that are shared
by more than one such entity.
(c) TRU is the total number of residential units anticipated upon
completion of the project.
(d) Land size is the total size of the project in net acres.
(e) The effective residential density ("ERD") shall be calculated
according to the expression:
ERD = [TRU + (TNR/ARU)] ÷ land size. The effective
residential density shall not be greater than the level of
residential density allowed for a project in § 335-30F(1).
G. Procedural requirements.
(1) Conceptual review.
(a) All parties contemplating a request for the establishment of a
PDO District shall first confer with the Zoning and Planning
Administrator prior to appearing before the Plan Commission
or filing a rezoning petition and provide sufficient written
details and drawings concerning the proposed project as
necessary to permit an adequate staff review.
(b) A staff review may involve other Village departments and
professional consultants in the assessment of the feasibility
and potential impact of the project on Village infrastructure
and resources as well as its conformity with the provisions of
the Village's Zoning Code.
(c) Any party desiring to submit a petition for the establishment of
a PDO District shall, following completion of the staff review
process, meet with the Village Plan Commission for a
conceptual review prior to the submission of the petition.
(d) The purpose of the conceptual review is solely for the purpose
of allowing the exchange of informal observations about a
possible project while facilitating the orientation of the
members of the Plan Commission and the petitioner(s) of a
potential project regarding issues that may have to be
addressed in the event that a petition is filed.
(e) All discussion about the proposed nature and scope of the
contemplated project at the conceptual review by Village staff
and Plan Commission members shall be nonbinding
commentary and shall not, under any circumstance, vest any
party with any right with respect to any development or project
contemplated or discussed.
§ 335-30 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-30
326:531
(f) A request for a conceptual review shall be accompanied by the
payment of the fee established by Village Board resolution
from time to time.
(2) Petition. Following completion of the conceptual review, all affected
real estate owners within the proposed PDO District or their agents
shall file a petition with the Village Clerk for rezoning of the
property as a PDO District. Such petition shall be accompanied by
the review fee established by Village Board resolution from time to
time and by all of the following information:

may reduce the minimum number of required off-street parking
spaces in specific cases as described in this section.
(2) Adjustments. The minimum number of required parking spaces
may be adjusted by the Plan Commission on a case-by-case basis.
The petitioner for such an adjustment shall show to the satisfaction
of the Plan Commission that adequate parking and access will be
provided for customers, deliveries, clients, visitors, and employees.

demands will be less than the chapter requirements by
submitting written documentation and data to the satisfaction
of the Plan Commission that the operation will require less
parking than this chapter requires.
(3) Changes in occupancy or use. When the use of part of a building,
structure, or land is changed to another use or building owner that
requires more parking spaces than required for the use existing
immediately prior to such change, additional parking spaces shall
be provided for the new use or occupant in the amount necessary to
conform to this section unless an adjustment is approved by the

regulations of this Zoning Ordinance of Elm Grove.
D. Ownership. A parked or stored recreational vehicle permitted by this
section must be owned by the owner of the premises upon which it is
located or by the tenant if said dwelling is a rentable property, it being
the intention of this restriction to provide said permission only for

accommodate friends or family members residing outside the
community except for visitation not to exceed 14 days per calendar
year. Any permit issued under the terms of this section is issued to the

traffic; or
[3] Interferes with the intent and purpose of the Downtown
District Site Design Guidelines with respect to connectivity
of pedestrian access.
(c) Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the Plan Commission
from requesting additional information deemed relevant for
the purpose of evaluating a proposed deviation from the
requirements of this section.
C. Driveway culverts shall be installed or replaced when, in the opinion of
the Director of Public Works, installation or replacement is reasonably
necessary to reduce or prevent erosion or promote or improve
drainage. Installation or replacement of driveway culverts shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 325, Art. II,

B. Signs requiring permit. It is the intent of this subsection to establish
guidelines for sign allocations predicated on business function, location
and adjacent zoning, aesthetic compatibility with building, business
center or adjoining businesses, along with the need for public service
and information. Various types of signs are required at business
establishments to communicate the nature of the business and to give
direction on location and services. The following guidelines shall be
§ 335-48 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-48
326:562
used by the Building Board to review business sign sizes, height,
numbers, type and illumination:
(1) Maximum size of signs. The size of allowable signs shall be
determined by the Building Board, based on the intent stated in the
introductory paragraph of this subsection and the applicable
requirements, if any, of this subsection. In the absence of such
applicable requirement, the formula to be used in determining
maximum size is either one square foot of sign area per one linear
foot of building frontage, or one square foot of sign area per 200
square feet of usable building area, whichever is greater. The
Building Board shall calculate the sign area of all signs covered by
this chapter, and the total sign area for each business or
professional location shall not exceed the figure determined by the
Building Board.
(2) Measuring signs. The Building Board shall include the sign copy
and any border or frame surrounding that copy to calculate the
area of a sign and determine if it meets the requirement of this
chapter. Supporting members of a sign shall be excluded from the
calculation of area. The area of irregularly shaped signs or signs
containing two or more detached elements shall be determined by
the area of the smallest regular polygon that will encompass all
elements of the sign. For purposes of this subsection, the terms
"area of sign" and "sign area" refer to the surface encompassed
within the perimeter of the sign which forms the outside shape of
the sign. If a sign contains more than one section or part, all
sections and parts shall be included in the total area of the sign.
When calculating the area of the sign, it shall be determined by
measuring the outside perimeter of the sign. When calculating the
area of a sign to determine if it meets the requirements of this
chapter, the area shall include the sign copy and any border or
frame surrounding that copy. For signs that are double-faced, or
have a sign copy on two faces which are back to back and facing in
different directions, each sign face may equal the maximum sign
area allowed under this subsection. Supporting structures of signs
shall not be included in the "area of sign" and "sign area," however,
all ornamental elements however attached to the sign shall be
included in determining the sign area.
(3) Height. A ground sign shall harmonize with the building or activity
it advertises or identifies, and no such ground sign shall be more
than 20 feet above the average ground elevation of the lot or
exceed the height of the building, whichever is lower, except within
50 feet of Bluemound Road where the maximum sign height shall
not exceed 25 feet.
(4) Sign type, illumination, design and area allotment.
(a) The type and amount of illumination is to be approved by the
Building Board.
§ 335-48 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-48
326:563
(b) Overpowering light levels should not be used.
(c) We encourage building facades and identification signs to be
illuminated from dusk to 11:00 p.m.
(d) No sign shall exceed 60 square feet in area regardless of
location, except as stated in § 335-48B(4)(e) of this chapter.
(e) Businesses which front on Bluemound Road may be allowed up
to 1.5 times the sign area normally designated for their
category at the discretion of the Building Board.
(f) Only one projecting hanging sign shall be allowed per business
establishment. Wall-mounted and hanging signs will be allowed
as approved by the Building Board.
(g) Uniform sign format for Business Centers. [Amended
8-24-2015]
[1] Business Centers of four or more tenants shall have a
uniform sign format to be approved by the Building Board,
concurrent with the site plan. In addition to fulfilling all
the requirements of this chapter, the uniform sign format
shall include the following components:
[a] An aesthetically developed theme.
[b] The proposed locations and an example rendering of
all Permanent Signs to be located on the building,
including Exterior Signs and Projecting Signs. Where
possible all Exterior Signs and Projecting Signs shall
be centered over the business establishment.
[c] If proposed for the Business Center, the application
shall include the location of the center identification
Ground Sign and directory Utility Signs. Utility Signs
shall not count towards the total allowable Sign area.
[d] Each business within the center shall be allocated a
Sign area to conform with the requirements under
Subsection B(1) above. Each business Sign within the
center shall contribute a proportionate share of its
Sign allocation toward the center identification or
directory sign.
[e] Each business within the center shall be allowed one
Exterior Sign and one Hanging Sign.
[f] The sign area allotments listed above are considered
the maximum allowable per business unit and may be
reduced at the owner's option or upon the Building
Board's recommendation when inappropriate for a
specific reason or business activity.
§ 335-48 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-48
326:564
[g] When a change is proposed for a Sign located within a
business center with an approved uniform sign
format, the proposed change shall be required to
conform to the requirements of the business center's
uniform sign format. An application to change the
Sign shall be made by the owner or occupant of the
premises and shall be submitted to the Zoning and
Planning Administrator or his/her authorized
designee. The submitted application shall include all
the information listed in Subsection C below. Said
application shall be reviewed by the Zoning and
Planning Administrator or his/her authorized designee
to ensure the Sign change meets the requirements of
the approved uniform sign format for the business
center. If the Sign application meets the requirements
of the business center's uniform format, a permit shall
be issued. The Zoning and Planning Administrator or
his or her duly authorized designee may forward a
permit application on to the Building Board if it is
determined that such review and approval is
necessary.
[h] Business Centers with less than four tenants may
submit for approval of a uniform sign format. Such a
submittal shall be governed in the same manner as
prescribed in this code.
[2] Wholesale-manufacturing-center terminal. Each such
business may be allowed up to one square foot of sign area
per linear foot of building frontage on a public or private
roadway serving its location.
(5) Signs shall be compatible with respect to size, proportions,
materials and color with nearby structures and surroundings.
(6) Signs shall be designed as an integral architectural element of the
structure and site to which it principally relates.
(7) The colors, materials and lighting of every sign shall be restrained
and harmonious with the structure and site to which it principally
relates.

or replacement of a worn or damaged legally existing sign to
its original condition; and shall maintain the premises on which
the sign is erected in a clean, sanitary and inoffensive
condition, free and clear of obnoxious substances, rubbish,
weeds and grass. The sign owner shall also be responsible for
the removal of any sign within 30 days following the
discontinuance of any business. If any such sign is not removed
within such time, or if the Zoning Administrator shall find that
such sign is not properly maintained and in a good state of
repair, or if a sign has been erected in a manner that is not in
conformance with the original permit, the Zoning
Administrator shall give the property owner written
notification to remove said sign within 15 days, after which
time the Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to remove
the sign, and all expenses incurred shall be assessed against
the property owner.
(b) Illuminated signs.
[1] All glass fixtures shall be made of safety glass, wire mesh
or otherwise constructed to prevent broken pieces from

Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Administrator or Building
Board under this article may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals under
Article IX of this chapter. In considering such an appeal, the Board of
Appeals shall be guided by the standards set forth in this article.
§ 335-49.1. Nonconforming signs.
The Zoning Administrator may issue four nonconsecutive
permits per applicant for exterior temporary signs in the
course of a year. There shall not be more than one exterior
temporary sign located on any single lot at any one time. An
exterior temporary sign permit shall be issued only for the

B. Purpose. In the exercise of its police powers, the Village has priority
over all other uses of the right-of-way. The purpose of this section is to
provide the Village with a process for managing, and uniform standards
for acting upon, requests for the placement of wireless
telecommunications facilities within the right-of-way consistent with
the Village's obligation to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare; to manage the right-of-way; and to ensure that the public's use
is not obstructed or incommoded by the use of the right-of-way for the
placement of wireless telecommunications facilities. The Village
recognizes the importance of wireless telecommunications facilities to
provide high-quality communications and Internet access services to
residents and businesses within the Village. The Village also recognizes
its obligation to comply with applicable federal and state laws
regarding the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities in
the right-of-way, including, without limitation, the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.), Section 6409(a) of the Middle
Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, §§ 182.017 and 196.58,

provisions.
C. Scope.
(1) Applicability. Unless exempted by Subsection C(2), below, every
person who wishes to place a wireless telecommunications facility
in the right-of-way or modify an existing wireless
telecommunications facility in the right-of-way must obtain a
wireless permit under this section.
(2) Exempt facilities. The provisions of this section (other than
Subsections J through N) shall not be applied to applications for the
following:
(a) Installation of a small wireless facility on the strand between
two utility poles, provided that the cumulative volume of all
wireless facilities on the strand shall not exceed one cubic foot,
and provided further that the installation does not require
replacement of the strand, or excavation, modification, or
replacement of either of the two utility poles linked by the
strand.
(b) Installation of a mobile cell facility (commonly referred to as
"cell on wheels" or "cell on truck") for a temporary period in
connection with an emergency or event, but no longer than
required for the emergency or event, provided that installation
does not involve excavation, movement, or removal of existing
facilities.

activity does not disrupt or impede traffic either vehicular or
pedestrian in the traveled portion of a street, and if the work
does not change the visual or audible characteristics of the
wireless telecommunications facility.
D. Nondiscrimination. In establishing the rights, obligations, and
conditions set forth in this section, it is the intent of the Village to treat
each applicant and right-of-way user in a competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory manner, to the extent required by law, while taking
into account the unique technologies, situation, and legal status of each
applicant or request for use of the right-of-way.

complaint/action to the applicant.
G. General standards.
(1) Generally. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall meet the
minimum requirements set forth in this Chapter and the wireless
regulations, in addition to the requirements of any other applicable
law or regulation.
(2) Regulations. The wireless regulations and decisions on wireless
permits shall, at a minimum, ensure that the requirements of this
Chapter are satisfied, unless it is determined that the applicant has
established that denial of an application would, within the meaning
of federal law, prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of
telecommunications or personal wireless services, or otherwise
violate applicable laws or regulations. If that determination is
made, the requirements of this Chapter and the wireless
regulations may be waived, but only to the extent required to avoid
the prohibition.
(3) Standards.
(a) Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be installed and
modified in a manner that:
[1] Minimizes risks to public safety;

[2] Ensures that placement of facilities on existing structures
is within the tolerance and suitability of those structures in
consideration of all other fixtures planned for or existing
thereon;
[3] Avoids, where technically feasible, placement of facilities
in aboveground areas, installation of new support
structures or equipment cabinets in the public right-ofway,
or placement in residential areas when commercial
areas are reasonably available;
[4] Maintains the integrity and character of the
neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are
located;
[5] Ensures that installations minimize the intrusion on the
right-of-way;
[6] Ensures that the Village bears no risk or liability as a result
of the installations; and
[7] Ensures that the applicant's use does not inconvenience
the public, interfere with the primary uses of the right-ofway,
or hinder the ability of the Village or other
government entities to improve, modify, relocate, abandon,
or vacate the right-of-way or any portion thereof, or to
cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation,
or abandonment of facilities in the right-of-way.
(b) No wireless permit shall be issued unless:
[1] The wireless service provider applicant has immediate
plans to use the proposed facility; or
[2] The wireless infrastructure applicant has a contract with a
wireless service provider that has immediate plans to use

Code, § 1-16.
(b) Term. A wireless permit issued pursuant to an eligible facilities
request shall expire at the same time the permit for the
underlying existing wireless telecommunications facility
expires. Otherwise, wireless permits shall be valid for a period
of five years from the date of issuance unless revoked pursuant
to Subsection I(2) of this section.
(c) Contact information. The permit holder shall at all times
maintain with the Village accurate contact information for the
permit holder and all wireless service providers making use of
the facility, which shall include an office and cell phone
number, mailing address, and email address for at least one
natural person and his or her backup who shall be available 24/

emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to
persons or property.
(e) Indemnities. The permit holder, by accepting a permit under
this section, agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
the Village, its elected and appointed officials, officers,
employees, agents, representatives, and volunteers
(collectively, the "indemnified parties") from and against any
and all suits, actions, legal or administrative proceedings,
claims, demands, damages, liabilities, interest, attorneys' fees,
costs, and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature in any
manner caused in whole or in part, or claimed to be caused in
whole or in part, by reason of any act, omission, fault, or
negligence, whether active or passive, of the permit holder or
anyone acting under its direction or control or on its behalf,
even if liability is also sought to be imposed on one or more of
the indemnified parties. The obligation to indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless the indemnified parties shall be applicable
even if the liability results from or in part from an act or failure
to act on the part of one or more of the indemnified parties.
However, the obligation does not apply if the liability results
from the willful misconduct of an indemnified party.
(f) Adverse impacts on adjacent properties. The permit holder
shall undertake all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse
impacts to adjacent properties and/or uses that may arise from
the construction, operation, maintenance, modification, or

complete copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals
issued in connection with the facility, which includes without
limitation all conditions of approval, approved plans,
resolutions, and other documentation associated with the
permit or regulatory approval. In the event the Village cannot
locate any such full and complete permits or other regulatory
approvals in its official records, and the permit holder fails to
retain full and complete records in the permit holder's files,
any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved
through an examination of the missing documents will be
conclusively resolved against the permit holder.
(m) Radio frequency emissions. Every wireless facility shall at all
times comply with applicable FCC regulations governing radio

underlying existing wireless telecommunications facility expires.
Otherwise, wireless permits shall be valid for a period of five years
§ 335-50.2 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-50.2
326:586
from the date of issuance. Upon expiration of the wireless permit,
the permit holder must either:
(a) Remove the wireless telecommunications facility; or
(b) Submit an application to renew the permit at least 90 days
prior to its expiration. The facility may remain in place until the
renewal application is acted on by the Village and any appeals
from the Village's decision are exhausted.
(2) Revocation for breach. A wireless permit may be revoked for failure
to comply with the conditions of the permit or applicable federal,
state, county or Village ordinance or regulations or rules. Upon
revocation, the wireless telecommunications facility must be
removed within 30 days of receipt of written notice from the
Village. All costs incurred by the Village in connection with the
revocation, removal, and right-of-way restoration shall be paid by
the permit holder.
(3) Failure to obtain permit. Unless exempted from permitting by
Subsection C(2) of this section, a wireless telecommunications
facility installed without a wireless permit must be removed within
30 days of receipt of written notice from the Village. All costs
incurred by the Village in connection with the notice, removal, and
right-of-way restoration shall be paid by entities who own or
control any part of the wireless telecommunications facility.
J. Relocation. Except as otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, a
permit holder shall promptly, and at its own sole expense without right
of any reimbursement, with due regard for seasonal working
conditions, permanently remove and relocate any of its wireless
telecommunications facilities in the right-of-way whenever the Village
requests such removal and relocation. The Village may make such a
request to prevent the facility from interfering with a present or future
Village use of the right-of-way or on a utility pole for designated
services per § 66.0414(1)(y), Wis. Stats.; a public improvement
undertaken by the Village; an economic development project in which
the Village has an interest or investment; when the public health, safety,
or welfare require it; or when necessary to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a permit holder shall not be required to
remove or relocate its facilities from any right-of-way that has been
vacated in favor of a nongovernmental entity except an abutting
property owner, unless and until that entity pays the reasonable costs of
removal or relocation to the permit holder.
K. Abandonment.
(1) Cessation of use. In the event that a permitted facility within the
right-of-way is not in use for a continuous period of 60 days or
longer, the permit holder must promptly notify the Village and do
one of the following:
§ 335-50.2 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-50.2
326:587
(a) Provide information satisfactory to the Village Manager that
the permit holder's obligations for its facilities under this
section have been lawfully assumed by another permit holder.
(b) Submit to the Village Manager a proposal and instruments for
dedication of the facilities to the Village. If a permit holder
proceeds under this Subsection K(1)(b), the Village may, at its
option:
[1] Accept the dedication for all or a portion of the facilities;
[2] Require the permit holder, at its own expense, to remove
the facilities and perform the required restoration under
Subsection L; or
[3] Require the permit holder to post a letter of credit or
provide payment sufficient to reimburse the Village for
reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing
the facilities and undertaking restoration under
Subsection L.
(c) Remove its facilities from the right-of-way within six months of
notifying the Village of nonuse for 60 days and perform the
required restoration under Subsection L, unless the Village
Manager waives this requirement or provides a later deadline.
(2) Abandoned facilities. Facilities of a permit holder who fails to
comply with Section 11(a) and which, for six months, remain
unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are
deemed to be a public nuisance. In addition to any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, the Village may, at its option:
(a) Abate the public nuisance and recover the cost from the permit
holder or the permit holder's successor in interest;
(b) Take possession of the facilities; and/or
(c) Require removal of the facilities by the permit holder or the
permit holder's successor in interest.
L. Restoration. In the event that a permit holder removes or is required to
remove a wireless telecommunications facility from the right-of-way
under this section (or relocate it pursuant to Subsection H), the permit
holder must restore the right-of-way to its prior condition in accordance
with Village specifications. However, a support structure owned by
another entity authorized to maintain that support structure in the
right-of-way need not be removed but must instead be restored to its
prior condition. If the permit holder fails to make the restorations
required by this Subsection L, the Village at its option may do such
work. In that event, the permit holder shall pay to Village, within 30
days of billing therefor, the cost of restoring the right-of-way.
§ 335-50.2 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-50.2
326:588
M. Placement on Village-owned or-controlled structures. The Village may
negotiate agreements for placement of wireless telecommunications
facilities on Village-owned or -controlled structures in the right-of-way.
The agreement shall specify the compensation to the Village for use of
the structures. The person or entity seeking the agreement shall

Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 335-51. Existing nonconforming uses and structures. [Amended
6-24-2003; 7-22-2003; 5-24-2005; 8-22-2006]
The lawful nonconforming principal use of a building, premises, structure,
fixture, land or water existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of
this chapter may be continued although the principal use does not conform
to the provisions of this chapter. (NOTE: For purposes of this section, a
"fixture" is defined in accordance with the Wisconsin case law rule. The rule
which has developed in Wisconsin case law as to what constitutes a fixture
is not really a comprehensive definition but rather a statement of the factors
that are to be applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular case to
determine whether or not the property in question does constitute a fixture:
"...Whether articles of personal property are fixtures, i.e., real estate, is
determined in this state, if not generally, by the following rules or tests: 1)
Actual physical annexation to the real estate; 2) Application or adaptation
to the use or purpose to which the realty is devoted; and 3) An intention
on the part of the person making the annexation to make a permanent
accession to the freehold.") A principal structure used in accordance with
applicable zoning regulations that does not conform to applicable frontage,
width, height, area, yard, parking, loading or setback requirements shall be
considered to be a nonconforming structure but not a nonconforming use.
A. Nonconforming uses.
(1) Only that portion of the land or water in actual use may be so
continued, and a nonconforming use may not be extended or
enlarged.
(2) If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 12 months,
any future use of the building, structure, fixture or premises shall
conform to the chapter.
(3) Uses that are merely casual and occasional or accessory or
incidental to the principal use cannot acquire a nonconforming use
status.
B. Nonconforming structures.
(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection B(4) of this section,
structural additions and enlargements to existing legal
nonconforming structures are permitted to the extent that such
structural additions and enlargements do not create or increase
nonconformity with applicable setback lines or applicable yard,
height, parking, loading or access provisions of this chapter.
[Amended 6-26-2012]
(2) The Village Plan Commission may, in its discretion, upon receipt of
the Building Board's recommendations and following a public
hearing noticed by a Class 2 notice, grant a special exception to
§ 335-51 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-51
326:591
allow a structural addition or enlargement that encroaches into the
setback requirements.
(a) No application for a special exception shall be considered
unless the Zoning Administrator has received the fee
established by the Village Board of Trustees from time to time,
by resolution, together with a completed application and the
information required under § 335-88D(1) of this chapter.
(b) No application for a special exception shall be granted unless
the Plan Commission determines that all of the following
conditions are satisfied:
[1] The subject structure is legally conforming with respect to
use.
[2] No point on the proposed addition or enlargement shall
have a distance to a lot line that is shorter in length than
the distance from the same lot line to the closest point on
the subject structure as it existed at the time of the
request for a special exception.
[3] The proposed addition or enlargement is not contrary to
the public interest or detrimental to public health or
safety.
[4] The proposed addition or enlargement shall not be
detrimental to the character or property values of the
surrounding area.
[5] For corner lots, the Board shall also determine that the
proposed addition or enlargement will not impair a
reasonable vision clearance for traffic on adjacent
streets.51
(3) Subject to Subsection B(4), a damaged or destroyed nonconforming
structure may be restored to the size, location, and use that it had
immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, without
limitation as to the costs of repair, reconstruction, or improvement,
if all of the following apply: [Amended 6-26-2012]
(a) The nonconforming structure was damaged or destroyed on or
after March 2, 2006.
(b) The damage or destruction was caused by violent wind,
vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or infestation.
(4) A damaged or destroyed nonconforming structure that meets the
requirements under Subsection B(3) may be restored to a larger

water shall conform to the provisions of this chapter.

loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as grounds for the
granting of a variance.

preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by
other properties in the same district and same vicinity.

detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair or be
contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest.

A. Plan of operation review and approval requirements.
(1) No person shall operate, and no property owner shall allow the
operation of, a commercial enterprise, industry, home business,
church, school, nonprofit organization or other nonresidential use
without first obtaining the approval of a plan of operation from the
Plan Commission as set forth in this section, and no residential or
nonresidential activity shall be engaged in or carried on, except as
approved in the plan of operation permit. All plans of operation as
required by this chapter shall include written verification of the
nature and scope of the proposed use from the property owner or
his registered agent. For activities that require a plan of operation,
property owner(s) and business operator(s) shall have a joint,
ongoing obligation to obtain, maintain, and amend plans of
operation pursuant to the requirements of this section for all such
activities occurring on the owner's property.
(2) As persons or entities requiring a plan of operation change the
nature of the person's or entity's activity so as to change the
category of its use as defined by § 335-32J, approval of an amended
plan of operation shall be required.
(3) The Zoning Administrator is permitted to approve plans of
operation where the nonresidential use does not change and the
new business at that same location would not result in additional
employees, changes in hours of operation or a significant increase
in the flow of traffic.
(4) If implementation of an approved plan of operation has not been
initiated within one year from the date of issuance, said plan of
operation shall become void.
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 335-85A(4), an extension may
be granted by the Plan Commission should circumstances warrant.
The applicant for the plan of operation and the property owner or
his registered agent shall be jointly responsible for timely securing
such an extension.
B. Temporary plan of operation permits. Temporary plan of operation
permits are required for seasonal business operations, such as fruit and
vegetable stands. In addition, a temporary plan of operation permit
§ 335-84 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-85
326:609
shall be required for any business operation that seeks to temporarily
deviate from its approved hours of operation or plan of operation on file,
excepting special events as may be permitted under Chapter 241 of the
Village Code. The length of the temporary permit shall be established
at the time of permit issuance. The Zoning Administrator may approve
a temporary plan of operation permit unless s/he determines that the
proposed event is of such a magnitude that it warrants additional
review, in which case the Zoning Administrator shall have discretion
to refer said temporary plan of operation to the Plan Commission for
review and consideration.
C. Plan of operation permit exemptions. The following public uses are
exempt from plans of operation permit requirements:
(1) Municipal facilities.
(2) Public schools.
D. Required information for a plan of operation permit. All plans of
operation shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator on forms
supplied by the Village. The applications for plan of operation permits
shall show the following information:
(1) Name, type and address of the business or institution.
(2) Name, address, and contact information of the property owner.
(3) Name and address of the business owner (name partners for a
partnership and directors for a corporation or L.L.C.).
(4) Name, address, and contact information of the operator of the
activity at the identified premises, if other than the property owner.
(5) The proposed hours of operation and activities to occur both inside
and outside all principal and accessory structures.
(6) The number of full-time and number of part-time employees,
including the average number of employees per shift.
(7) Verify that the Village has current site and floor plan information on
file. If such records do not exist, current site and floor plan
information, with dimensions, shall be provided for all commercial
buildings.
(8) Parking, as required by this chapter.
(9) Description of business activity and processes, including the use of
any hazardous and flammable materials (as identified within SARA
Title III: The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act) or equipment that emits noise or vibration audible from the
outside of the building.
(10) Signage and illumination of building exterior.
§ 335-85 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-85
326:610
(11) Such additional information as may be determined by the Plan
Commission or Zoning Administrator for plan of operation
approval.
E. Criteria for plan of operation approval. The following criteria will be
used by the Plan Commission in reviewing applications for plan of
operation permits:
(1) Proximity to residential neighborhoods and the potential for
disturbing and disrupting residential uses.
(2) Adequacy of the principal structure and other structures on the site
for the proposed activity. Plan of operation permits will only be
issued to businesses to be conducted in permanent structures.
Temporary plan of operation permits may be issued, at the
discretion of the Plan Commission, for temporary structures or
facilities not on a permanent foundation, such as wheeled-trailers,
vendor carts and seasonal stands.
(3) Availability of adequate parking to meet the needs of employees
and customers.
(4) Adequacy of street access.
(5) Compliance with all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
F. Hours of operation.
(1) Authority. Based upon the impact on residential areas in proximity
to commercial uses and the cost of police protection and other
public services necessary to adequately serve the business with
extended hours of operation, the Village Board finds that it is
necessary to limit hours of operation for all businesses.
(2) Hours allowed. The plan of operation required by this section shall
contain a proposal for hours of operation. No business may be open
to the public between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. except
for the following uses:
(a) Gasoline stations.
(b) Gasoline stations with incorporated food marts (under 5,000
square feet).

elevations, historic and probable future floodwater elevations,
depth of inundation, floodproofing measures and plans for
proposed structures with dimensions and elevations pertinent to
the determination of the hydraulic capacity of the structures or
their effect on flood flows. Where floodproofing is required, the
applicant shall submit a plan or document certified by a licensed
professional engineer or architect attesting to the adequacy of the
floodproofing measures to withstand flood forces and velocities
associated with a one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood. Prior
to the issuance of a certificate of compliance, the applicant shall

C. Plan Commission review.
(1) The Village Plan Commission shall review all applications for
conditional use permits. The Plan Commission shall review the site,
existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring
uses, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access, traffic

access shall be required of all conditional uses unless a variance
has been granted under Article IX of this chapter; provided,
however, that the Village Board may, with the recommendation of
the Plan Commission, authorize the reconstruction of a lawful preexisting
detached garage at its current location and in its current
dimensions, notwithstanding noncompliance with the setback and
minium square footage requirements of this chapter.
(2) Amendments. Changes subsequent to the initial issuance of a
conditional use permit that result in a need to change the initial
conditions shall require an amendment to the conditional use
permit. Enlargement of a conditional use shall not be considered an
amendment. The process for amending a permit shall generally
follow the procedures for granting a conditional use permit.
(3) Revocation of conditional use permit. In the event an applicant or
its heirs or assigns fail to comply with the conditions of the
conditional use permit, or if the use, or characteristics of the use, is
changed without prior approval by the Plan Commission, the
conditional use permit may be revoked by the Village Board of
Trustees. The process for revoking a permit shall generally follow
the procedures for granting a permit.
F. Existing conditional uses. Lawful uses existing at the effective date of
this chapter that would be classified as a conditional use in the
particular district concerned if they were established after the effective
date of this chapter shall be considered legal conditional uses without
further action of the Village. Changes to or substitution of such
conditional uses shall be subject to review and approval by the Village
Board of Trustees in accordance with this section.
G. Notice to Department of Natural Resources. The Zoning Administrator
shall transmit a copy of each application for a conditional floodland use
or shoreland W-1 District conditional use to the Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources (DNR) for its review and comment. Action on such
applications shall not be taken for 30 days or until the DNR has made its
recommendation, whichever occurs first. A copy of floodland
§ 335-86 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-86
326:614
conditional use permits and shoreland W-1 District conditional use
permits shall be transmitted to the DNR within 10 days of the effective
date of such permit.
H. Conditional use review of communication structures. The following
procedures and standards are applicable to proposed communication
structures identified as conditional uses within this chapter. Terms
within this section shall have the meanings found in § 335-50.1 and
§ 335-94. [Added 10-13-1997; amended 8-25-2014]
(1) Application and review. The Village Manager shall determine an
application to be complete and eligible for formal presentation to
the Plan Commission and establishment of public hearing date only
after the applicant has submitted information as required under
this chapter.
(2) Fees and deposits. The Village Manager shall identify and estimate
the need of the Village to engage expertise to assist the Village
staff, the Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees in reviewing
the application. Per the requirements set forth in § 30-3, the Village
Manager shall inform the applicant of these requirements, and the
amounts that the applicant will be required to pay shall be
confirmed by the Plan Commission at its initial formal review and
may be modified by the Plan Commission if additional expertise
needs to be engaged. These amounts shall be due and payable by
the applicant to the Village within the timetable established by the
Village per § 30-3.
(3) Application documentation. The applicant shall submit in writing as
part of its application the following documentation:
(a) The name and business address of, and the contact individual
for, the applicant.
(b) Construction plan showing the location of the proposed or
affected wireless Tower; and renderings showing site and
structural features, including network components, Wireless
Communication Antennas, transmitters, receivers, base
stations, power supplies, cabling and any other associated
equipment that is necessary to provide wireless
communication service.
(c) If the application is a substantial modification of an existing
Tower or Mobile Service Facility, the applicant shall submit a
construction plan which describes the proposed modifications,
including equipment and network components, antennas,
transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling
and related equipment associated with the proposed
modifications.
(d) If the application is to construct a new Tower and/or a New
Mobile Service Facility, a construction plan which describes
§ 335-86 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-86
326:615
the proposed structure and the equipment and network
components, including antennas, transmitters, receiver's base
stations, power supplies, cabling and related equipment to be
placed on or around the new wireless tower.
(4) Co-location preference; public site preference.
(a) As a matter of municipal policy, the Village of Elm Grove
strongly supports co-location (single locations accommodating
multiple Wireless Communication Antennas and related
facilities on a single Mobile Service Support Structure or
groupings of Mobile Service Support Structures) and location
of facilities on public property. Applicants proposing locations
not conforming with these policy preferences shall have the
burden of demonstrating the necessity of location on private
property and/or as single-use or single-system Mobile Service
Facilities. Sites and Mobile Service Facilities proposed for
approval shall generally be sized and designed to allow
flexibility for addition of more facilities by the same applicant
entity or other entities, and the Village may negotiate terms
and conditions facilitating co-location. Once approved,
additional antennas and accessory facilities may be added to a
site in accordance with the sharing conditions of the
conditional use approval.
(b) Permittees shall exercise good faith in co-locating and/or
clustering with other communication companies and sharing
the permitted site, provided such shared use does not give rise
to a substantial technical level or quality-of-service impairment
of the permitted use (as opposed to a competitive conflict or
financial burden). In the event a dispute arises as to whether
the permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating other
users, the Village may require a third-party technical study at
the expense of either or both the applicant and complaining
user.
(c) If an application seeks to construct a new Tower and Mobile
Service Facility the applicant shall provide a written
explanation, in addition to the other required submittal
materials, as to the reason for the proposed location instead of
co-location with an existing Mobile Service Facility. This
explanation shall include a sworn statement by the individual
who has the responsibility over the placement of the wireless
Tower attesting that co-location is not possible due to the
following factors;
[1] Co-location would not result in the same communication
service functionality, coverage and capacity;
[2] Co-location is technologically infeasible; and
§ 335-86 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-86
326:616
[3] Co-location creates an unreasonable economic burden to
the wireless communication service provider.
(5) Additional criteria and requirements for conditional use permit.
(a) All changes made to towers exceeding what was requested in
the original application or otherwise legally existing at the date
of adoption of this subsection, including, but not limited to,
adding microwave dishes, or increasing the height, or profile,
shall require review and approval by the Plan Commission.
(b) All towers and sites shall be properly maintained and shall be
kept in a condition as not to become a public nuisance or
eyesore. Proper maintenance shall include, but not be limited
to, regular lawn and landscaping care, painting of an accessory
building, fences, and tower. Additionally, the site shall be kept
clear of junk and trash.
(c) Landscaping requirements.
[1] For all commercial towers over 50 feet in height, the tower
base, accessory building, anchor points, and parking area
shall be screened with a four-foot-tall (at time of planting)
evergreen hedge consistent with the landscaping
requirements for nonresidential properties.
[2] For towers of 180 feet or greater, at least one row of
deciduous trees not less than a caliper of 2 1/2 inches'
diameter at breast height (dbh) shall be planted between
the tower and public rights-of-way and residential
properties. The type and amount of required landscaping
shall be determined by the Plan Commission on a case-bycase
basis.
[3] The Plan Commission may allow an alternative
landscaping or screening plan or waive the landscape
requirements if it is determined that the landscaping will
not serve a functional value based on existing topography
or surrounding land uses.
(d) Every three years, beginning with the adoption of this
subsection or following completion of construction of a tower,
whichever is later, the owner of the tower shall submit to the
Village Engineer a report from a structural engineer or other
expert acceptable to the Village Engineer reflecting the fact
that such tower is structurally sound and does not pose any
threat to life or property.
(e) No apparatus shall be attached to any tower except as
approved by the Plan Commission. Apparatus attached legally
to existing towers prior to enactment of this subsection may
remain but not be increased in any way except with approval of
§ 335-86 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-86
326:617
the Plan Commission. Approval of the Plan Commission for
additional apparatus will be granted only after the applicant
demonstrates a need for additional apparatus.
(f) Prior to final approval for new towers or within one year of the
date of adoption of this subsection for existing towers, the
tower owner shall furnish a financial guarantee, in the form of
a letter of credit, to the Village in the amount of $20,000. The
amount of such financial guarantee may be reviewed by the
Plan Commission at any time to determine the sufficiency of
such amount to remove the tower and restore the site upon
which it is located. Funds from the financial guarantee letter of
credit may be used by the Village to pay any professional fees
associated with the removal of the tower and/or restoration of
the site upon which it is located.
(g) Prior to final approval for new towers or within one year of the
date of adoption of this subsection for existing towers, the
owners shall furnish proof of liability insurance which protects
against losses due to personal injury or property damage
resulting from the construction, operation or collapse of the
tower, antennas or accessory building in a form satisfactory to
the Village Attorney.
(h) This subsection applies to both towers existing at the time of
adoption of this subsection and those constructed thereafter.
(6) Conditions. Conditional use approvals shall contain conditions
addressing issues such as maintenance, including allocation of
responsibilities and costs for maintenance in co-location situations,
mandatory removal of towers upon termination of their use,
security features and provisions allowing municipal access for
inspection purposes, and related issues.

architectural features, improve appearance, screen
parking areas and miscellaneous structures, provide
wildlife habitat, provide shade and enhance the
streetscape.
[3] Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain
plant varieties and other materials and by coordination
with landscaping or materials on adjacent developments.
[4] Plant materials shall be selected on the basis of size at
maturity, hardiness, tolerance for site specific
environmental conditions, screening value, wildlife habitat
values and all season appearance.
[5] Use of plants that are indigenous to the area shall be
encouraged.
[6] Nonnative plants that are considered a nuisance or
invasive species, such as purple loose strife, honeysuckle
and buckthorn shall not be used as plant materials.

provide screening and landscape benefits within three
growing seasons from the time of planting. Trees planted
in front yard areas or in other highly visible areas where
they serve as a visual screen, should be at least two inches
in diameter and eight feet high at the time of planting.
Evergreens should be a minimum of six feet high at the
time of planting. Shrubs should be balled and burlapped
and a minimum of 18 inches high at the time of planting.

screens consisting of building wall extensions, plantings,
berms or other innovative means so as to screen parking
areas.
[12] Screening of service yards and other places that tend to be
unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing,
planting or combinations of these. Screening shall be
equally effective in winter and summer. Screens shall be
compatible and harmonious with the landscaping and site
treatments on neighboring properties.
[13] Prohibition of disturbing steep slopes. Steeply sloped
terrain with a natural grade of 25% or more may not be
regraded, built upon or otherwise disturbed. The Planning
Commission and Building Board may grant an exception to
this requirement where the area proposed for disturbance
is an isolated area no more than 20,000 square feet in size,
and provided that such disturbance is necessary for the
development to occur and does not alter the overall
topographical character of the site.
(b) Building design.

not exceed 150 square feet in area. No residential
property shall be allowed more than one such structure.
[2] All such structures shall be anchored to a permanent
concrete foundation.
[3] All such structures shall be constructed of materials and of
colors aesthetically consistent with those of the principal
structure so as not to cause, in the judgment of the
Building Board, a substantial depreciation in the property
values of neighboring properties. However, unattached
yard maintenance buildings having a roof or sides, using
metal sheets as an exterior, shall not be erected under this
chapter.
[4] Yard maintenance buildings shall comply with all the
setback and yard requirements of this chapter, including
requirements in § 335-11C(1). However, if any person shall
desire to erect a structure closer to the lot line than the
district setback and yard requirement, the applicant shall
present to the Building Board written consent of such
location from each adjoining neighbor to which the
structure shall be visible at any time of the year. If such
written permission is not obtained and presented to the
Building Board, then the Building Board shall delay the

(g) Fences. [Amended 2-23-2015]
[1] Definitions. For the purpose of this subsection, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:
ARCHITECTURAL SCREENING DEVICE  Any standing
Fence or wall-type structure, connected directly to a
principal structure employed for screening, ornamental,
decorative, signage, or landmark purposes.
FENCE  A structure which creates an enclosure, barrier
or boundary, having a set or permanent location in the
ground, or which is attached to something having a
permanent location in the ground. All Fences shall be
constructed in such a manner that structural support
components shall be placed on the interior side of the
Fence in order to minimize their visibility off premises.
Fences include Architectural Screening Devices,
Decorative Fences, Garden Fences, Open Fences and Solid
Fences.
DECORATIVE FENCE  A fence that is an Open Fence
designed to decorate, accent or frame a feature of the
landscape or premises and that is not longer than 40 feet
in linear length in the aggregate.
GARDEN FENCE  Any structure in the nature of a Fence,
which defines the boundary of a garden or planting bed,
does not exceed 36 inches in height and is intended to
be used to impede access by wildlife to the planted area.
A Garden Fence shall not enclose a cumulative area of
more than 750 square feet on one property and may be
§ 335-88 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-88
326:635
constructed of wire-type materials, except for razor or
barbed wire or chain-link-type fence.
OPEN FENCE  Open Fences are those with more than
50% of their surface area open for free passage of light
and air. The meaning of 50% open space shall be that
for a given width of fence material (i.e., an individual
picket), an equal or greater amount of open space is to be
provided in between said fence material. Examples of such
Fences include picket, rail, and wrought iron, which are
not merely ornamental.
SOLID FENCE  Solid Fences are those with 50% or less
surface open for free passage of light and air and designed
to conceal from view the area behind them. Examples
of such Fences are stockade, board-on-board, board and
batten, basket weave and louvered fences.
[2] Fences are permitted in all districts, except the Floodway
and Wetland Districts, provided that:
[a] No person shall erect or construct any type of Fence
except a "Garden Fence" as defined in this section, on
any property in the Village of Elm Grove without first
having submitted an application and fee therefor; and
obtained a permit for such fence construction.
[b] All applications to construct an Architectural
Screening Device, a Decorative Fence, or an Open
Fence shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator
or his or her duly authorized designee, who thereafter
may issue a building permit. In the event that the
Zoning Administrator or his or her duly authorized
designee concludes that the proposed Fence does not
qualify as an Architectural Screening Device,
Decorative Fence, or an Open Fence, the Building
Board shall conduct a review of the associated
application and approve or deny issuance of a building
permit.
[3] Open Fences, Architectural Screening Devices and
Decorative Fences Requirements.
[a] All Open Fences and Decorative Fences located closer

yard requirements for the district in which they are
located shall not exceed four feet in height. The height
of a fence shall be measured from the average existing
grade beginning at its lowest level at ground level on
the outside of the fence. In the event that a fence is
constructed on a hill or berm, it shall be reduced in
height to compensate for the height of the berm or hill
§ 335-88 ELM GROVE CODE § 335-88
326:636
to avoid exceeding the overall fence height. Structural
ornamental posts protruding no more than six inches

other wood-simulated natural-appearing materials,
wrought iron or other metal materials generally
employed to achieve an aesthetically consistent
appearance. Except as otherwise provided in
Subsection D(8)(g)[1], "Garden Fence," no barbed
wire, chain link or other wire-type material shall be
used in any fence hereafter constructed within the
Village of Elm Grove unless a variance for such
material has been granted.
[d] No Open Fence or Architectural Screening Device
shall project forward of the rear line of the principal
building, except for Decorative Fences. In the event
that there is more than one rear line present on a
principal building, that rear line closest to the front of
the building shall be considered the rear line for
purpose of this section.
[e] An Architectural Screening Device may be
constructed with less than 50% of its surface area
open for free passage of light and air, provided that:
[i] The device is directly connected to an existing
principal structure;
[ii] The device complies with setback requirements of
the zoning district in which it is located;
[iii] The height shall not exceed six feet; and
[iv] The linear length, in aggregate, shall not be
greater than 20 feet.
[f] In addition to complying with other provisions of this
section, Decorative Fences may be located in a side,
rear or street yard setback, provided that they do not
exceed 4 1/2 feet in height. Decorative Fences that
§ 335-88 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY § 335-88
326:637
comply with setback requirements may not exceed
6 1/2 feet in height.
[i] Any Fence in excess of 40 feet in linear length
shall be regulated as either an Open Fence or
Solid Fence and be subject to the requirements
under this chapter.
[g] It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
demonstrate on a certified plat of survey the exact
location of the proposed fence, but excluding garden
fences as defined by this section.
[4] Solid Fences, or any Open Fence proposal at variance with
the aforesaid standards, shall be examined by the Building
Board. A variance from the terms of this chapter may be
granted by the Building Board, but only after a public
hearing before said Board.
[a] The Building Board, in reviewing a proposed Fence,
shall take into consideration the character or shape of
the lot or parcel of land and the placement of the
residence thereon, the architectural appearance,
including the compatibility with adjourning structure
and landscaping; and if the proposed fence is to be
located on a residential parcel, whether a hardship is
demonstrated as a result of its proximity to parcels
zoned as B-1, B-2, B-3, M-1, or I-1 or any active
railroad property, or any state or county highway.
[b] Upon receipt of such a fence application, notice of the
public hearing shall be given via U.S. Mail to any
adjoining neighbor located in a radius of 100 feet from
the proposed fence. Notice of the public hearing shall
require a Class 2 publication notice. The notice shall
invite each neighbor to offer reasons for approval or
disapproval of the application as submitted. The
reason should be communicated to the Village, in
writing, or given testimony at the review meeting. All
position statements received shall be included with
the review materials and shall be considered during
the review.
[c] After the public hearing, the Building Board may grant
or reject such request for a variance.
[5] Upon the destruction of any fence in the Village of Elm
Grove, or deterioration by the elements or otherwise to
more than 50% of its condition or extent when originally
erected, no fence may be constructed in place of such
destroyed or deteriorated fence without having first
complied with the terms and requirements of this section.

construction of a fence as of such date, and which did not
comply with the terms relating to fences in the Building
Code as of such date, shall be brought into compliance
with this fence ordinance on or before August 1, 1978,
unless an application for the granting of a variance shall
be made to the Building Board and the Building Board has
granted such requested variance in the manner described
in this present fence ordinance.
