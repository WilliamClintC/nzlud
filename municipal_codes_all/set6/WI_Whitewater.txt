WHITEWATER, WISCONSIN MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Whitewater, Wisconsin 
____________ 
Beginning in 2009, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
The Whitewater, Wisconsin Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1972, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mr. Clark Dempsey, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning in 2009, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1996A, passed April 21, 2020.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning in 2009, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of 2009, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning in 2009, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning in 2009, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 4-09, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2, 33.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 1686A, § 1, adopted June 3, 2008, amended Ch. 1.29, in its entirety, to read as herein set out in §§ 1.29.010 and 1.29.020. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Ch. 1.29 pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
 
1.29.010 - General provisions. 
(a)  Purposes. The purposes of this chapter are as follows: 
(1)  To assist the city in paying the cost of enforcing its housing, zoning, property-related and other codes; 
(2)  To promote the appropriate regulation and control of buildings and real estate in the city;

(b)  Findings.

(Ord. No. 1686A, § 1. 6-3-2008)  
1.29.020 - Reinspection fee. 
(a)  To compensate for inspection and administrative costs, a fee of $50.00 may be charged to the owner or occupant of property for any reinspection by a city of Whitewater staff member, employee, or officer to determine compliance with an order to correct conditions in violation of the following Whitewater Municipal Code provisions: Title 5 (Business Licenses and Regulations), Title 7 (Public Peace, Safety and Morals, only sections 7.18 Cisterns and Other Openings, 7.20 Vibration and Air Pollution, 7.22 Weeds and Grass, 7.23 Littering, 7.24 Prohibited Discharges, and 7.48 Storing Junk on Property), Title 8 (Health and Safety), Title 9 (Animals), Title 11 (Vehicles and Traffic), Title 12 (Streets, Sidewalks and Public Grounds), Title 14 (Buildings and Construction), Title 16 (Water and Sewers), Title 18 (Land Division and Subdivision) and Title 19 (Zoning). Except no fee shall be charged for the reinspection when compliance is recorded. A fee of $100.00 may be charged for a second reinspection, a fee of $200.00 for a third reinspection and a fee of $400.00 for each subsequent reinspection for the same condition. A reinspection fee may also be charged when a city staff member, employee, or officer finds a condition which is similar to a condition which was subject to a correction order within one year prior to the inspection. Reinspection fees shall be charged against the real estate upon which the reinspections were made, shall be a lien upon the real estate and shall be assessed and collected as a special charge. If there has been a change of ownership or occupancy after the city issues a correction order, the neighborhood services director may waive the reinspection fee if in his or her opinion the new owner or occupant was not aware of the prior order to correct a violation or condition. 
(b)  To compensate for inspection and administrative costs, a $50.00 fee may be charged for any inspection or reinspection when a contractor or property owner requests an inspection for permit-related work and the work is not ready at the time of the requested inspection. Failure to pay reinspection fees after one notice may result in withholding future permits. 
(c)  Any property owner or lessor receiving a fourth offense reinspection fee, for the same violation, may have the payment of the fee waived if the party or his or her representative personally meets with the neighborhood services director, or with his or her city designee, within seven days of receipt of the notice of the fee imposition. At the meeting the neighborhood services director and owner shall review the problems occurring at the property. Within ten days of this meeting, the owner shall submit to the neighborhood services director, or his or her designee, a detailed written abatement plan designed to forthwith and effectively correct the offense that caused the imposition of the fee. If the plan meets the neighborhood services director's approval, the fee shall be waived upon successful completion of the plan. The neighborhood services director shall notify the party that receives a fourth offense reinspection fee of the availability of this abatement process.

Chapter 2.48 - INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION[14] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (14) --- 
 For the statutory provisions authorizing a city, under the city manager form of government, to alter, reorganize or abolish commissions, see WSA § 64.10; for the provisions regarding promotion of industry and to borrow money for the reservation and development of industrial sites, see WSA § 66.52. 
 
2.48.010 - Purpose. 
It is found and declared that industries located in the city have been induced to move their operations in whole or in part to, or to expand their operations in other states or municipalities all to the detriment of the city's revenue raising through the loss or reduction of real estate and other local taxes, and thereby causing a decrease in employment opportunities and an increase in unemployment; that such conditions now exist in the city and may well continue to exist in the future; that economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the general welfare of the people of the city; that unemployment results in obligations to grant public assistance and in the payment of unemployment compensation; that the absence of new economic opportunities has caused workers and their families to migrate elsewhere to find work and establish homes, which has resulted in a reduction of the tax base of the city impairing its financial ability to support education and other local governmental services; that security against unemployment and the preservation and enhancement of the tax base can best be provided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, rehabilitation and revitalization of commerce, industry and manufacturing; that there is a need to stimulate a larger flow of private investment funds from banks, investment houses, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. 
It is therefore declared to be the policy of the city to promote the right of gainful employment, business opportunities and the general welfare of the inhabitants thereof and to preserve and enhance the tax base by the creation of an industrial development commission for the purpose of fulfilling the aims of this section and such purposes are hereby declared to be public purposes.

(e)  The legal custodian shall have full legal power to render decisions and to carry out the duties of an authority under Subchapter 11 of Chapter 19 of the Wisconsin Statutes and this section.

(Ord. No. 1782A, 5-4-2010)  
2.66.040 - Public access to records. 
(a)  Except as provided in Section 2.66.060, any person has a right to inspect a record and to make or receive a copy of any record as provided in Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1). 
(b)  Records will be available for inspection and copying during all regular office hours. 
(c)  A requester shall be permitted to use facilities comparable to those available to city employees to inspect, copy or abstract a record. 
(d)  The legal custodian may require supervision during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged. 
(e)  A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as follows: 
(1)  The cost of photocopying each page shall be set by the city clerk and set forth on a schedule which shall be kept in the clerk's office. Any increase as determined by the clerk shall be subject to the approval of the common council. The cost will be calculated not to exceed the actual, necessary and direct cost of reproduction. 
(2)  If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary cost of photographing and photographic processing shall be charged. 
(3)  The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on paper, such as films, computer printouts and audiotapes or videotapes, shall be charged. 
(4)  If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged. 
(5)  There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor exceeds fifty dollars, in which case the actual cost shall be determined by the legal custodian and billed to the requester. 
(6)  The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and may require a cash deposit adequate to assure payment, if such estimate exceeds five dollars. 
(7)  Elected and appointed officials of the city shall not be required to pay for public records they may reasonably require for the proper performance of their official duties.

(f)  Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 19.34, and the guidelines therein listed, each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which, the legal custodian from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of records, and costs thereof. 
(Ord. No. 1782A, 5-4-2010)  
2.66.050 - Access procedures. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stats § 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Subsection 2.66.040(e)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefore. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2.66.060. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons, for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(Ord. No. 1782A, 5-4-2010)

(a)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 19.36, the following records are exempt from inspection under this section: 
(1)  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law; 
(2)  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state; 
(3)  Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection; and 
(4)  A record of any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. 
(b)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 43.30, public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this section. 
(c)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them; 
(2)  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing; 
(3)  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline or any city officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a city officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure; 
(4)  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention; 
(5)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of city property, investing of city funds, or other city business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure; 
(6)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data; 
(7)  Communications between legal counsel for the city and any officer, agent or employee of the city, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the city or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(d)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the city attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the city attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment of the custodian and the city attorney, there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. 
(Ord. No. 1782A, 5-4-2010)  
2.66.070 - Destruction of public records. 
City officers may destroy records of which they are the legal custodians and which are considered obsolete but not less than seven years after the record was effective unless a specific period of time is provided by the Wisconsin Statutes. 
(1)  Prior to the destruction of any public records, at least sixty days' notice in writing shall be given the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. The historical society may upon application, waive such notice. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any minimum period of time for retention set forth above, any taped recording of a meeting, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.82(2), by any governmental body, as defined under Wis. Stats. § 19.82(1), of the city may be destroyed no sooner than one year after the minutes have been approved and published if the purpose of the recording was to make minutes of the meeting. 
(3)  Transcripts of Tape Recordings of Municipal Court Trials. Audio tape recordings of trials or juvenile matters in municipal court shall be kept until the time has expired for taking an appeal of such matters to the Circuit Court of Walworth County or Jefferson County. Upon the expiration of such period, city officers are empowered to dispose of, erase, destroy or reuse any such audio tapes; and to destroy any written duplicate copies of transcripts made from such tapes. 
(4)  Municipal Court, Traffic, Juvenile or Ordinance Violation Case Files. All court papers or written court records in the possession of the municipal court or the city police department in proceedings commenced by the issuance of municipal court citations or pleadings shall be kept for six years after the entry of final judgment. 
(5)  All police dispatch audio tapes shall be kept for thirty days except those tapes that cover significant incidents. Tapes covering significant incidents will be retained seven years after the incident is closed. 
(Ord. No. 1782A, 5-4-2010)  
2.66.080 - Preservation through microfilm. 
Any city officer, or the director of any department or division of city government may, subject to the approval of the common council, keep and preserve public records in his or her possession by means of microfilm or other photographic reproduction method. Such records shall meet the standards for photographic reproduction set forth in Wis. Stats. §§ 16.61(7)(a) and (b) and shall be considered original records for all purposes. Such records shall be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of state law and of Sections 2.66.040 through 2.66.060 of this chapter.

5.20.027 - Licensing standards for considering new alcohol license applications. 
A.  Alcohol License Review Committee Review. All new (as opposed to renewal) applications for open "Class A" sale of intoxicating liquor to consumers in original packages for off premises consumption licenses, and open "Class B" sale of intoxicating liquor to consumers by the glass for on premises consumption licenses, shall be reviewed by the alcohol license review committee (at times hereafter referred to as the ALRC) before the application is acted upon by the common council. The ALRC shall recommend that the council grant, deny, or grant with conditions each license. The common council shall consider the recommendation of the ALRC when considering license applications. The term "open" in this subsection shall mean an application for a license that has not been issued for at least twenty-four hours, and therefore is an open and available license. This section is not intended to apply when a license holder surrenders a license pursuant to a contract to transfer the business associated with the license, and the same license is issued immediately to the purchasing party. 
B.  Staff input. The ALRC and the common council shall consider the below listed factors in reviewing and judging the adequacy of applications. Appropriate city staff shall review the application in the context of these factors and report to the committee. The city staff may include the city manager, the police department, the fire department, the community development authority, the city clerk's office, the city attorney's office, the neighborhood services director's office, the department of public works office, and any other staff as deemed necessary or desirable. It shall not be required that all of the foregoing participate in any particular recommendation, rather it is the intent that the make-up of the staff involved be flexible to meet the needs of each particular situation. 
C.  Factors to be considered. The ALRC in making its recommendation, and the council in making its decision, shall consider the following factors: 
1.  Factors to be considered for reviewing new license applications: 
a.  Economic development considerations. The council finds that while all of the factors listed below are important considerations in licensing issuance decisions, economic development consideration should be a primary factor in the decision. In considering the economic development impact of an application, the ALRC and the council will favor license applications that support important additional desirable development, such as businesses that provide high quality employment opportunities, businesses that provide attractive entertainment opportunities, or establishments that feature high quality restaurants. 
  The council also finds that establishments whose primary purpose is to serve alcohol, and that do not support other important additional developments should be given low priority in the application process because the city has an excess supply of similar establishments and those establishments do not foster economic development. Also, such businesses' tend to cause more police enforcement related problems, and often detract from the immediate neighborhood and at times diminish the quality of life in the City of Whitewater. 
  The council also finds that it is appropriate and in the public's best interest to at times hold in reserve one or more licenses that are limited by quota so that there will be a license or licenses available if a highly desirable development that needs a license seeks to locate in the City of Whitewater. 
b.  Character of applicant, agent, managerial personnel, and owners. 
c.  Experience of applicant and manager in operating a licensed establishment. 
d.  History of applicant and manager in operation of licensed establishments. 
e.  History of premises. 
f.  Design, type, and size of the proposed establishment. 
g.  Proximity to other licensed establishments. 
h.  Proximity to residential buildings or areas. 
i.  Ability of police department to ensure public safety at this location. 
j.  Condition of building/premises. 
k.  Compatibility of proposed use with the surrounding neighborhood. 
l.  Zoning and land use considerations. 
m.  Likely impact on property values. 
n.  Any other relevant considerations. 
D.  Ranking applications. When deciding between applications, those applications which best meet the listed factors shall be judged as superior to other applications. If there are multiple applications pending for licenses, whether the licenses are available or not, the timing of the filing of the application shall not create any preference. If more than one license application is pending for any particular license, the alcohol licensing committee shall recommend which application, if any, in order of priority, should be granted. 
(Ord. No. 1726A, § 1, 4-21-2009; Ord. No. 1762A, § 1, 4-20-2010)  
5.20.031 - Non-alcohol events—Underaged persons. 
The presence of underage persons on a licensed premises as provided under Section 125.07(3)(a)10, Wis. Stats., shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  The licensee or agent of a corporate licensee shall notify the police department at least seventy-two hours in advance of any date on which underage persons will be present on the licensed premises. Each such non-alcohol event notice shall specify the date(s) on which the event is to occur and the time(s) of commencement. All notices shall be filed with the police department during normal working hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday) and shall be given on forms prescribed by the department. After a non-alcohol event notice has been given, the licensee may cancel an event(s) only by giving like notice to the department in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Regardless of date given, all notices shall expire and be deemed cancelled no later than the date of expiration or revocation of the applicable retail Class "B" license. 
(2)  During the period of any non-alcohol event, a notice card prescribed by the police department shall be posted at all public entrances to the licensed premises notifying the general public that no alcohol beverages may be consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the licensed premises during the event. Such notice cards shall be made available by the department to a requesting licensee at no cost. 
(3)  Once a non-alcohol event has commenced, no alcohol beverages may be consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the licensed premises until the next day following the closing hours as specified in Section 5.20.090, Hours. 
(4)  During the period of any nonalcohol event, all alcohol, all beverages not stored in a locked portion of the licensed premises, shall be stored in a secure place out of sight and physical reach of any patron present, and shall be under the direct and immediate control and supervision of the licensee or a licensed bartender in the employ of the licensee. All beer taps and automatic dispensers of alcohol beverages ("speed guns") shall be either disconnected, disabled or made inoperable. 
(5)  No underage person under the age of eighteen shall be allowed on the premises at any time unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. 
(6)  A licensed premises may only schedule one nonalcohol event per week. Said event may not last more than twenty-four hours. 
(Ord. 1275 §1, 1994; Ord. 1274 §1, 1994; Ord. 1088 §1, 1986).  
5.20.032 - Cancellation. 
A.  Findings of fact and purpose. The common council finds that the nonuse of alcohol licenses that are available in limited numbers is generally contrary to the public's best interest. This is because alcohol licenses, if used responsibly, can attract and retain businesses such as restaurants and hotels, and thereby create jobs and provide non-alcohol-related entertainment and service opportunities for the general public. Furthermore, the nonuse of alcohol licenses, limited by quotas, is unfair to persons or businesses that seek to earn income through the use of a license, but are unable to receive a license because of the limited number available to be issued by the city. 
B.  Cancellation for nonuse. Any "Class A" or "Class B" license granted under this chapter may be cancelled by the common council 1) if it is not used within sixty days after its initial issuance (this sixty-day nonuse provision applies only to initial license issuance and does not apply to license renewals); 2) if its usage is discontinued for a period of ninety consecutive days or more; 3) if the holder does not use the license for at least fifty days during the one-year period of the license term; 4) if the licensee does not open and use its license on the minimum days and hours it submits under subsection C three or more times during a license term. 
For the purpose of this section, a day within the yearly license term shall be defined as a day during which the license grantee or holder is open for business and therein uses the license for a minimum period of six hours. Said hours shall be consecutive on the particular day. In order to be considered open, a "Class B" licensed premises must have a licensed bartender on duty and available and present on the premises to dispense alcohol. If there are two licensed premises in any one building, each premises must have a separate bartender available, present, and on duty during the time the premises is required to be open. 
C.  Reporting requirements: Each "Class A" or "Class B" licensed premises shall complete a form as part of the initial and annual renewal application process that lists the specific days of the week and specific hours it represents will be open which satisfies the minimum opening and use requirements set forth above. If any licensee changes its minimum required days or hours of operation stated in the application, the licensee shall immediately report the change in writing to the municipal clerk. Licensees are not required to disclose all hours it or they expect to be open, rather only those mandatory minimum hours it will be open. 
D.  Exceptions: In the event the grantee or holder of a "Class A" or "Class B" license issued under this chapter demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city council that, due to undue hardship or unusual circumstances beyond the grantee's or holder's control, the grantee or holder could not meet the minimum use requirements set forth herein within the yearly term of the license, the license grantee or holder may request that the city council grant an exception to the requirements found in subsections B and C above. Exceptions which the city council may consider in not imposing the requirements of subsections B and C are the following: 
(1)  Damage to the licensed premises rendering it temporarily unfit for safe operation under the license; 
(2)  Closing for reasonable periods of time to alter, repair, remodel or redecorate the premises; 
(3)  Certain factors of death, illness or contractual impossibility; 
(4)  Any other unusual circumstances not under the control of the license grantee or holder. 
E.  Investigations and inspections to determine compliance with this section may be conducted by the City of Whitewater Police Department, or any city employee or official directed by the city manager to conduct an investigation or inspection to determine compliance. If a licensee is found to be in violation of the terms of this section, future inspections shall subject the licensee to the imposition of reinspection fees under Chapter 1.29. Violations of this section shall also subject a licensee to the imposition of the penalties set forth in Section 5.20.160. 
F.  Prior to cancellation: Prior to the cancellation of any license, the city shall notify the licensee in writing of the city's intention to cancel the license for nonuse and provide the licensee with an opportunity for a due process hearing. Such hearing shall be conducted by the alcohol license review committee generally under the procedures set forth in Whitewater Municipal Code 5.20.025. 
(Ord. 1106 §1, 1987). 
(Ord. No. 1720A, § 1, 3-3-2009)  
5.20.040 - License—Issuance restrictions. 
A.  Delinquent Taxes, Assessments, Etc. 
(1)  Premises. No initial or renewal alcohol beverage license shall be granted for any premises for which taxes, assessments or other claims of the city are delinquent and unpaid. 
(2)  Persons. No initial or renewal alcohol license shall be granted to any person: 
(a)  Delinquent in payment of any taxes, assessments or other claims owed to the city; 
(b)  Delinquent in payment of a forfeiture resulting from a violation of any ordinance of the city; 
(c)  Delinquent in payment to the state of any state taxes owed. 
It is unlawful for any person to whom a license has been granted to permit any person to leave the licensed premises with an open container containing any alcohol beverage. 
(Ord. 1035 §2(part), 1984).  
5.20.045 - Maximum number of licenses. 
A.  The common council finds that limiting the number of alcohol licenses in one building is in the public's best interest because it will assure that there will not be an unnecessary use of two alcohol licenses for a building when one alcohol license could serve the building. 
B.  The total maximum number of "Class A" and "Class B" licenses issued to premises in any single building shall be limited to two. Also, no building shall be allowed to have more than one "Class A" or more than one "Class B" license. Therefore, when a "Class A" or "Class B" license is issued to a building, no other license of the same class shall be issued to a premises in the same building. If the council finds that it is in the public's best interests, the council may grant exceptions to these limitations. For the purpose of this section, a combination license issued to a premises shall be considered one license. 
(Ord. No. 1721A, § 1, 3-3-2009)  
5.20.050 - License—Quotas. 
The number of the following described licenses to be issued by the city shall be limited to the quota established in this section: 
(1)  Combined "Class A" intoxicating liquor, four; 
(2)  "Class B" intoxicating liquor, twenty-four. 
(Ord. 1183 §1, 1990; Ord. 1161 §1, 1989; Ord. 1035 §2(part), 1984). 
(Ord. No. 1844A, § 1, 8-21-2012; Ord. No. 1864A, § 1, 10-15-2013)  
5.20.055 - Reserve "Class B" liquor license fees. 
(a)  Purpose. This section is enacted pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes Section 125.51(3)(e)2. (1997) which requires municipalities to establish a fee of at least $10,000.00 for the initial issuance of reserve "Class B" licenses for the retail sale of alcohol beverages. 
(b)  Establishment of Fee. Pursuant to Section 125.51 of the Wisconsin Statutes (1997), there is hereby established a $10,000.00 fee for the initial issuance of a reserve "Class B" license as defined in Wisconsin Statutes Section 125.51(4)(a)4. (1997). This $10,000.00 fee shall not apply to a reserve "Class B" license issued to any bona fide club or lodge situated or incorporated in this state for at least six years, or to any full-service restaurant that has a seating capacity of three hundred or more persons, or to any hotel that has one hundred or more rooms of sleeping accommodations and that has either an attached restaurant with a seating capacity of one hundred fifty or more persons or a banquet room in which banquets attended by four hundred or more persons may be held. The fee for these exempted "Class B" licenses shall be the same as the annual fee for regular "Class B" licenses as established by Section 5.20.060. 
(Ord. 1447 §1, 2000).  
5.20.056 - Grants for certain reserve "Class B" liquor licenses. 
(a)  Definition. Reserve "Class B" license shall have the meaning defined in Section 125.51(4)(a)4, Wisconsin Statutes. 
(b)  Findings and Purpose. The common council finds that businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and taverns make important contributions to the city's economy. These establishments serve important public purposes, including increasing the city's property tax base, providing employment and promoting tourism. Excess license fees deter new business and are contrary to the above-stated public purposes. Wisconsin Statutes 125.51(3)(e)2 imposes upon municipalities the duty to establish a minimum issuance fee of $10,000.00 for each reserve "Class B" liquor license issued. Since the new issuance fee far exceeds the actual cost of licensing the activity, additional revenue will be available to the city. It is the purpose of this section to utilize revenue generated by Wisconsin Statutes 125.51(3)(e)2 to assist new reserve "Class B" licensees achieve the important public purposes identified herein. 
(c)  Grants. Following the issuance of an original reserve "Class B" liquor license, and upon application, the community development authority may provide a grant to the licensee in an amount not to exceed the amount actually paid by the licensee to the City of Whitewater for issuance of the new reserve "Class B" liquor license, less that amount attributable to the reserve "Class B" liquor license. Prior to awarding any grant hereunder, the community development authority shall make such findings and establish such conditions to ensure that any funds awarded hereunder further the important public purposes identified herein. 
(Ord. 1620A §1, 2007).

The grantee shall maintain a written log or an equivalent capable of access and reproduction of all service interruptions and requests for service, which shall be available for city inspection during the franchise period. 
(2)  Telephone Lines. The grantee shall provide a local exchange telephone number for a minimum of three years and toll-free telephone access to its subscribers within the franchise territory. Any calls should be answered by a customer service representative during normal business hours; calls made outside this period may be answered by an automated response mechanism, but such calls should be processed by a grantee's representative within twelve hours. The grantee shall provide sufficient phone answering capacity that customers are receiving an appropriate "level of service" as noted in renewal criteria in federal cable law. 
(3)  Local Office. The grantee shall provide a public business and service office, or a minimum of two "drop-off" locations within the city and convenient to customers, which shall be open during normal business hours. The office shall, at a minimum, be able to accept and process subscriber payments, service requests and customer complaints.

The grantee may request the city to extend the installation period for reasonable circumstances beyond its control. 
(5)  Repair Standards. The grantee shall maintain a repair force capable, under normal circumstances, of responding to service interruption and degradation complaints made during normal business hours within four hours. For complaints made outside normal business hours, the grantee must respond within sixteen hours. For the purpose of this subsection, "response" shall mean at a minimum contacting the subscriber by phone or in person. Where a grantee misses either of these deadlines, grantee must provide the subscriber in good standing with one free month's service. The grantee may request the city to extend the service call period for reasonable circumstances beyond its control. 
(6)  Service Call Scheduling. When the grantee needs to arrange a service appointment at a subscriber's location, the grantee must offer the subscriber a service window not to exceed four hours in duration. Grantee may not cancel a service window without the subscriber's consent. Where a grantee misses a service window, grantee must provide the subscriber with one month's free service. The grantee may request the city to extend the service call period for reasonable circumstances beyond its control. 
(7)  Service Interruptions and Significant Degradation. When the grantee has failed to provide a subscriber with appropriate service due to service outage or significant audio or video degradation not due to the subscriber's equipment or action, the grantee must notify the subscriber that the subscriber may request a rebate of any fees paid for the affected service(s) under the following schedule, and the grantee must provide such rebates. For the purpose of this section the outage or degradation period shall begin when the subscriber provides notice to the grantee of the outage or degradation. For the purposes of this section any complaints of outage or degradation by a subscriber within any month shall be cumulative. The grantee may request the city waive or modify the rebate provisions for reasonable circumstances beyond its control.

(1)  Rules and procedures under which the cable operator is permitted to use such channel capacity for the provision of other services if such channel capacity is not being used for the purpose designated; and 
(2)  Rules and procedures under which such permitted use shall cease. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the grantee to indemnify the city, its officers, boards, committees, commissions, employees or others against claims, expenses or liability arising from any program carried on any channel designated for public, educational or governmental use, or any other channel obtained under mandatory access provisions or under similar arrangements required by federal, state or local law.

Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance of a peace officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances make it impracticable, a peace officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct.

7.41.020 - Notice. 
A.  Whenever the neighborhood services director determines that four or more property condition nuisance related activities resulting in enforcement action have occurred at a premises on separate days during a twelve-month period, the neighborhood services director, or his/her designee, may notify the premises owner and, if appropriate, tenant, in writing. In reaching this determination, the neighborhood services director shall not include nuisance activities resulting in enforcement actions that were reported by the owner of the premises. Only the neighborhood services director may initiate and implement the procedure and enforcement for property condition nuisance related activities under this section. A copy of the notice shall be delivered to the occupant of the premises by regular mail. 
B.  The notice shall contain the street address including unit number if applicable or legal description sufficient to identify the premises, a description of the property condition nuisance related activities and enforcement actions that have occurred at the premises; a statement indicating that the cost of future enforcement may be assessed as a special charge against the premises, and a notice as to the appeal rights of the owner.

D.  In an effort to foster early and fair resolutions to nuisance related concerns; and to avoid actions being brought under this chapter, and to encourage the full and fair reporting of nuisance activities in the City of Whitewater, the city council authorizes the following procedure: 
The city manager shall have the power to designate a neighborhood preservation board which will act as a mediator concerning nuisance matters that may lead to actions under this chapter. The board shall also inform and assist residents who are aggrieved by nuisance activities in the City of Whitewater. The board shall be formed upon its own initiative, and its members shall not be appointed by the City of Whitewater. The makeup of the board shall be determined by the board, and the board will not be an official Board of the City of Whitewater. 
Each neighborhood shall submit a number of potential members for inclusion in the board roster. The landlords will submit their roster of representatives. Two appropriate neighborhood representatives and two appropriate landlord representatives will hear each case. The board roster shall be reformed bi-annually, and must be approved by the city manager. After formation of a board roster, the board shall request that the city recognize it as the neighborhood preservation board to act under this chapter. The city manager shall only designate a board as the neighborhood preservation board if its makeup and organization fairly represents the best interests of the City of Whitewater. 
This board may be invoked by referral from the neighborhood services director after the second violation of the ordinances and/or codes contained within the chronic nuisance statutes. It is acknowledged that there will be occasions when the nature and timing of two incidents do not present an appropriate circumstance for a referral to the board. Therefore, the neighborhood services director shall have the discretion to make the decision as to whether or not to refer matters to the board. 
The primary functions of the board shall be the following: 
1.  Regarding the pattern of offenses which invoked the ordinance, the board will: 
a.  Serve as a forum to discuss, educate, encourage negotiations, and mentor the parties on the issues involved; 
b.  Identify neighborhood and property owner's concerns; 
c.  Attempt to achieve resolution of the complaint(s) and the underlying issue(s) involved so as to potentially resolve the current complaint and to prevent further violations of the ordinances and codes contained within the chronic nuisance statutes, 
d.  To provide property owners with a forum to express their position regarding administration and enforcement of the ordinance as it relates to the complaint, and 
e.  Offer recommendations to the neighborhood services director as well as the individuals directly affected by the complaint. 
If the board's actions do not resolve the conflict, the board shall provide an advisory recommendation to the neighborhood services director regarding the matter. If the board cannot come to a majority recommendation on the issue in question, the procedures set forth in the ordinance shall continue as if there were no board. The board must meet and make recommendations in a timely fashion. The board must convene within a month of the referral from the city and provide a recommendation within two weeks of the meeting. Failure to meet in said timely fashion will result in the ordinance procedures progressing as if there were no board. The neighborhood services director shall have the full discretion to decide if the action under this chapter shall continue, be modified, or be dismissed. In making his or her decision, the neighborhood services director shall consider any recommendation made by the board.

Chapter 9.20 - BACKYARD BEEKEEPING[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1915A, § I, adopted Feb. 18, 2016, amended the code by adding provisions designated as Ch. 9.18, §§ 19.18.010—19.18.040. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, the provisions have been redesignated as Ch. 19.20, §§ 19.20.010—19.20.040 at the discretion of the editor. 
 
9.20.010 - Purpose. 
The following regulations will govern the keeping of honey bees and are designed to prevent nuisances and prevent conditions that are unsafe. No person shall keep honey bees unless the following regulations are followed: 
(1)  Number. No more than three colonies of honey bees shall be allowed for each principal structure. There may be maintained on the same property, one additional nucleus colony in a hive structure not exceeding one standard nine and five-eighths-inch depth ten-frame hive body with no supers attached as required from time to time for management of splitting colonies or captured swarms. Each such nucleus colony shall be moved, disposed of, or combined with an authorized colony within thirty days after the date it is acquired. If the beekeeper serves the community by removing a swarm or swarms of honey bees from a location where they are not desired at the request of a property owner or city of Whitewater employed staff, a beekeeper may maintain these swarm colonies on their property and not be considered in violation of the portion of this chapter limiting the number of colonies while temporarily housing the swarm for no more than thirty days after the date the swarm is acquired. Two additional colonies per acre would be allowed for every property one acre or larger in size. 
(2)  Setbacks. Beehives shall be kept at least thirty feet from any principal structure other than the owner's principal structure. Beehives shall not be located within five feet of a side yard or rear yard lot line. Beehive entrances shall face away from the property line of the residential lot closest to the beehive. Beehives shall not be located in the front yard. 
(3)  Enclosure. Honey bees must be maintained in beehives with removable combs for inspection purposes. Both langstroth and top bar beehives are acceptable structures. The beehive structures must be maintained in good repair. 
(4)  Flyway Barrier. For any beehive placed within thirty feet of a developed public or private property line, as measured from the nearest point of any hive to the property line, a six-foot tall flyway barrier must be constructed and must extend at least ten feet on either side of the nearest beehive. The flyway barrier is defined as a solid or closely slatted fence (no more than three inches between slats), wall, dense line of vegetation, or combination thereof. The purpose of the flyway barrier is to raise the flight path of bees leaving the beehive, thereby limiting their interactions with nearby residents. The requirement will be waived, however, if the beehive is placed on an elevated porch, balcony, or roof top that is at least ten feet off the ground and at least ten feet from the property line and at least twenty-five feet from any adjacent dwelling or occupied structure. The flyway barrier shall still be required for an elevated porch, balcony, or roof top if the adjacent property has a similar elevated porch, balcony, or roof top. 
 
(5)  Water Sources. Because the most common nuisance complaint of urban honey bees is bees congregating at nearby water sources such as bird baths, pet water bowls, and pools, beekeepers must maintain two water sources on their property and each water source shall be continually filled with water when the bees are active outside the hive (water source may cease in the winter months). At least one of the two water sources shall be placed within twenty feet of the beehives. Suggested water sources would include a bird bath that is regularly filled with water and/or a chicken waterer — each filled with stones to allow bees to perch near the water. 
(6)  Beekeepers shall ensure that no empty beehives, bee comb, or other materials that might encourage robbing are left upon the property. Upon their removal from the hive, all such materials shall promptly be disposed of in a sealed container or placed within a building or other bee-proof enclosure. No open feeding of honey bees is allowed. 
(Ord. No. 1915A, § I, 2-18-2016)  
9.20.020 - Permit. 
A permit shall be required to keep honey bees in the city of Whitewater. An application for a permit must contain the following items: 
(1)  The name, phone number, and address of the applicant. 
(2)  The location of the subject property. 
(3)  A proposal containing the following information: 
(A)  A description of beehives and required flyway barriers providing dimensions and the precise location of beehives and flyway barrier in relation to property lines and adjacent properties. 
(B)  The application fee charge for the permit shall be $10.00. There shall be no charge for renewal of the permit. 
(4)  If the applicant proposes to keep honey bees in the yard of a rented dwelling, the applicant must present a signed statement from the owner of the dwelling consenting to the applicant's proposal for keeping honey bees on the premises. 
(Ord. No. 1915A, § I, 2-18-2016)  
9.20.030 - Permit renewal. 
Permits will be granted on an annual basis (unless this section is repealed). If the permittee follows the terms of the section, the permit will be presumptively renewed (unless this section is repealed) and the applicant may continue to keep honey bees under the terms and conditions of the initial permit. The city neighborhood services director may refuse to renew or may revoke the permit at any time, (after giving the permittee fifteen days' notice of the basis for the revocation or nonrenewal and an opportunity to be heard on the issue) if the permittee does not follow the terms of this section, or if the neighborhood services director finds that the permit holder has not maintained beehives or provided the required two water sources that are continuously containing water. If the honey bee ordinance is repealed, no party shall have the right to keep honey bees based on a nonconforming use status obtained under this section. 
(Ord. No. 1915A, § I, 2-18-2016)  
9.20.040 - Penalty. 
Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a penalty of not less than $50.00 or more than $100.00 for the first offense; and for the second offense within one year, shall be subject to a penalty of not less than $100.00 or more than $200.00; and for a third and subsequent offenses within one year not less than $200.00 or more than $300.00, together with the costs of prosecution.

(Ord. No. 1888A, § 1, 2-3-2015)

(Ord. No. 1888A, § 1, 2-3-2015)  
11.51.030 - Definitions. 
The following words and phrases, whenever used in this chapter, shall have the meanings defined in this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

"Street" means any public right-of-way, including arterials, connectors, alleys, ways, lanes, and roadways by any other designation, as well as bridges, tunnels, and any other portions of the transportation network. 
"Street project" means the construction, reconstruction, retrofit, maintenance, alteration, or repair of any street, and includes the planning, design, approval, and implementation processes, except that "street project" does not include minor routine upkeep such as cleaning, sweeping, mowing, spot repair, or interim measures on detour routes. 
"Users" means individuals that use streets, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle drivers, public transportation riders and drivers, and people of all ages and abilities, including children, youth, families, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. 
(Ord. No. 1888A, § 1, 2-3-2015)  
11.51.040 - Complete streets ordinance goals and guidelines. 
The City of Whitewater shall attempt to enhance the safety, access, convenience and comfort of all users of all ages and abilities, providing for equality in use between pedestrians (including people requiring mobility aids), bicyclists, transit users, motorists and freight drivers, and businesses and residents who need adequate parking through the design, operation and maintenance of a transportation network, so as to create a connected network of facilities accommodating each mode of travel that is consistent with and supportive of the local community and businesses, recognizing that all streets are different and that the needs of various users will be balanced in a flexible manner to achieve complete streets. This goal shall be implemented as follows: 
A.  The City of Whitewater will consider including complete streets elements in all public transportation projects, in order to provide appropriate accommodation for bicyclists, pedestrians, transit users and persons of all abilities, while promoting safe operation for all users, in comprehensive and connected networks, in a manner consistent with, and supportive of, the surrounding community. 
B.  As practical, the City of Whitewater shall incorporate complete streets infrastructure into existing streets so as to improve the safety and convenience of users, construct and enhance the transportation network for each category of users, and foster economic development and new employment. 
C.  The City of Whitewater shall recognize that complete streets may be achieved through single elements incorporated into a particular project, or incrementally through a series of smaller improvements or maintenance activities over time. The City of Whitewater shall approach every transportation project and program as an opportunity to improve streets and a transportation network for all users. 
D.  The City of Whitewater shall use the Whitewater Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Bicycle Facility Design Handbook and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities as guides for meeting these goals. 
E.  Complete streets, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities features shall be incorporated, when applicable and practical, in all city street projects, and reconstruction, repaving, and rehabilitation projects, with only the following exceptions: 
(1)  Bicycles or pedestrians are prohibited by law from using the facility. 
(2)  The cost of establishing bikeways or walkways as part of the project would be disproportionate in cost or to anticipated future use (not the current use). 
(3)  The existing right-of-way is constrained in a manner that inhibits simple addition of transit, bicycle, or pedestrian improvements. In this case, the city shall consider alternatives such as lane reduction, lane narrowing, on-street parking relocation or reduction, shoulders, signage, traffic calming, or enforcement. 
(4)  Where such facilities would constitute a threat to public safety or health in the determination of the city engineer or the city staff. 
F.  All initial planning and design studies, and other project reviews, for public infrastructure projects requiring funding or approval by the City of Whitewater shall: 
(1)  Evaluate the effect of the proposed project on safe travel by all users, and 
(2)  Identify measures to mitigate any adverse impacts on such travel that are identified. 
G.  When drafting or revising design guidelines, the City of Whitewater shall consider including complete streets infrastructure and goals, such as bicycle lanes and cycle tracks, sidewalks, street crossings, curb geometries, and planting strips. The design of new or reconstructed facilities should anticipate and support likely future demand for bicycling, walking and transit facilities. 
H.  Because freight is important to the basic economy of the city and has unique right-of-way needs to support that role, freight will be a priority on streets classified as truck routes. Complete streets improvements that are consistent with freight mobility but also support other modes shall be considered on these streets. 
I.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to impose any additional civil liability upon the City of Whitewater other than that which is imposed by existing law.

Chapter 12.46 - PUBLIC ARTWORK 
 
12.46.010 - Declaration of purpose. 
These regulations relating to community art in the city of Whitewater (hereafter referred to as the "city") further the following purposes: 
(1)  Public artwork is meant to be seen, but more so experienced, as a work of art can help inspire and provide perspective no matter what the subject at hand. Artwork should be proposed in the following areas and ways: 
(A)  Integrating public artwork into parks, greenbelts and other public locations. 
(B)  Building cohesion through projects that engage the public. 
(C)  Using art as a way to celebrate, reflect and enhance the character and history of a space. 
(D)  To add interest to public spaces. 
(2)  In developing its vision for the future of the city, the city council believes that planning and development decisions should give aesthetic and social value equal weight with any project's functional and economic value. Community art strengthens public places and enhances and promotes Whitewater's identity as a livable and creative city and a desirable place to live, work and visit. Therefore, the council wishes to implement a process and provide opportunities to involve artists in the design, implementation and integration of art in community projects. 
(3)  The presence of works of art and decorative elements in public places in the city enhances the quality of life, promotes the general welfare, maintains the quality of the environment and property values, and enhances the attractiveness of the city for residents and visitors. 
(4)  Identifying locations for public works of art and decorative elements and participating in the building of a community art collection of high quality can be stimulating and unifying for the city and contribute to civic pride reflective of the city's diversity. 
(5)  The artwork is intended for public owned spaces and the following zoning districts: B-1, B-1A, B-2, B-3, M-1, M-2 and WUTP. 
(6)  Public artwork is defined as art in any media that has been planned and executed with the intention of being staged in the physical public domain, usually outside and accessible to all. Public artwork is significant within the art world, amongst curators, commissioning bodies and practitioners of public art, to whom it signifies a working practice of site specifically, community involvement and collaboration.

Structural and maintenance issues of the prospective artwork will also be considered when selecting a site, as some areas will be prone to public interactions with the art. In selection of a site the public works department should be notified to insure that any existing utilities will not be affected. A work installed in these areas must be structurally sound to ensure the safety of the community as well as the longevity of the work. 
(Ord. No. 1900A, § 1, 8-4-2015)  
12.46.040 - Accession. 
All works of art purchased, commissioned or accepted as donations become property of the city of Whitewater. All city artwork is maintained by the city and included in an inventory kept by the public art committee. 
People wishing to donate artwork to the city must submit slides, a written description of the work, and a rationale for the gift. The public art committee will review the submitted piece for quality, maintenance requirements, donor stipulations, safety issues of the piece, availability of an appropriate site, and advice of the administrators at that site. Based on this review the public art committee will either accept or decline the donation. 
(Ord. No. 1900A, § 1, 8-4-2015)  
12.46.050 - Selection processes. 
There are three standard ways of purchasing a piece of art. In addition to these, the city may acquire artwork through gifts. For each of the processes outlined, the public art committee and city's acquisition procedures will be used. 
(a)  Open Competition. Artists submit proposals in response to a public advertisement. The selection committee then reviews the proposals and recommends an artist or artists for acquisitions or requests more detailed proposals from selected artists. 
(b)  Limited, Invitational Competition. The public art committee recommends a limited number of artists on the basis of an interview or review of work. The artists are then invited to develop a site-specific proposal for a particular project. The artists are given an honorarium and all the necessary information as well as the opportunity to present a model and proposal to the committee. The selection committee then reviews the submitted proposals and recommends acquisitions. This process might be most appropriate for art projects calling for collaboration between an artist and an architect or landscape artist. 
(c)  Direct Invitation. In this process, if there is a majority of the public art committee that feels one artist is particularly well qualified for a project s/he might be invited to submit a proposal and a model thereby bypassing the competition process. This process may be suitable should the appropriate situation arise (skip to subsection (d)(8) below). 
(d)  Acquisition Procedures. 
(1)  Public art committee defines the project, i.e., location of work or capital project with which art is associated, and the method of selection. Methods of selection may include open competition; invitational competition; or direct selection. 
(2)  Public art committee defines parameters of project to be used in the call for artists or direct selection, develops a budget for the project, and drafts a proposed call for artists or artists selection for city council approval. Public comment will be invited before the public art committee. For direct selection, proceed to step (8). 
(3)  City council considers proposal. 
(4)  Public art committee determines need for panel to work on selection process for project and identifies participants. Panels will include members of the public art committee, design professionals, and representatives of the user group/neighborhood. 
(5)  Public art committee reviews initial submittals, which include the artist's experience and qualifications, references, and preliminary proposal(s) for the project or specific works of art, to determine compliance with the call for artists. 
(6)  The panel, if convened by the public art committee, selects two or three semi-finalists from the group of qualified artists submitted to the panel by the public art committee. The semi-finalists may be asked to submit refined proposal(s). Semi-finalists may be paid a fixed honorarium, costs of travel and a per diem, depending upon the approved budget. 
(7)  The public art committee reviews the submittals of the two to three semi-finalists. The artist(s) may present their work at a public meeting. The artists' work is displayed in a public place for up to one week. Written comments from the public will be invited during this week. A public forum is held for discussion and input to the public art committee on selection of the preferred artist. The public art committee recommends the finalist to the city council. 
(8)  City council approves or denies the selection. Denial requires direction to the public art committee from the city council and beginning the process again at the appropriate step. 
(9)  After an affirmative vote by the council, the public art committee works with selected artist on refinement of concept, timeframe for completion of work, final budget, and approves the contract for work. 
(10)  The public art committee recommends contract to city council. 
(11)  City council approves contract. 
(Ord. No. 1900A, § 1, 8-4-2015)  
12.46.060 - Maintenance. 
Before a work is accepted into the city's collection, the artist must submit: 
(1)  A detailed list of exact types, brands, and colors of materials used. 
(2)  A summary of cleaning instructions. 
(3)  Estimated annual maintenance needs and costs in dollars. 
This information will be kept on file with the inventory of the city's collection. Any maintenance or restoration responsibilities that the artist might have must be clearly explained in the contract and agreed upon before the work becomes a part of the city's collection. A maintenance and inspection schedule suitable for the site and the work will be discussed with the artist and implemented upon possession of the work. Complete records of inspections, cleanings, and conditions of the works will be kept on file in the inventory. If a work in the city's possession becomes damaged in any way, the city may contact the artist to see if s/he can make the necessary repairs, or contact the necessary agencies or conservators to repair the work. 
(Ord. No. 1900A, § 1, 8-4-2015)  
12.46.070 - Deaccession/relocation. 
After due consideration, the city council may authorized the removal of a work. To remove a piece one or more of the following situations must exist: 
(1)  The artwork in its present state poses a safety hazard to the public or the environment. 
(2)  Restoration of the work aesthetically and/or structurally is not feasible, or the expense of such restoration would be disproportionate to the value of the work. 
(3)  The architectural support (building, wall, streetscape) is to be removed or destroyed if relocation of the work is not feasible. 
(4)  Prolonged protest of the work persists to the extent that the work detracts rather than enhances the site and the community. 
(5)  The work acts as an encumbrance to the use of public property. 
(6)  The public use of the site has changed or is proposed to change in a manner that is no longer compatible with the artwork. 
(7)  If a work is to be moved/modified, the artist must be notified before the change, if at all possible. In the instance that a work must be removed from the city's collection, the artist must be notified and given the opportunity to purchase the art from the city. In all situations, the rights of the artist will be respected as defined in the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, unless waived by the artist. 
(Ord. No. 1900A, § 1, 8-4-2015)  
12.46.080 - Community initiated public art. 
The community initiated public art application should be completed and submitted with proposals to the public art committee for their review and possible recommendation to the city council for final consideration. 
Applications can be submitted to neighborhood services department at the city of Whitewater located at 312 W. Whitewater Street. Applications must be submitted no less than one week prior to the "public discussion of any item not on the agenda". Applications presented at "public discussion" cannot be officially discussed or acted upon by the public art advisory committee until the next meeting when it can be placed on the agenda. 
(Ord. No. 1900A, § 1, 8-4-2015)  
12.46.090 - Public art committee. 
This committee acts in the public interest on all matters relating to the public art ordinance including the selection, placement, and maintenance of works of public art throughout the city. The committee provides public input in the administration and planning of the public art.

Title 13 - NATURAL LANDSCAPE YARD 
Chapters :  
Chapter 13.10 - IN GENERAL 
Sections: 
 
13.10.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this natural landscape yard title is to address concerns regarding landscaping in the City of Whitewater. Natural landscape gardens are viable alternatives to lawn development as they can be economical, low maintenance, effective in soil and water conservation, and may reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. This title is consistent with the goals of the Whitewater Comprehensive Plan referenced in Chapter (4), Natural Resources, pages 35, 38-44. Because the State of Wisconsin has prohibited yard waste in any solid waste disposal facility; has increased percentage regulations on stormwater runoff and has laws that protect the chemical invasion of lakes, streams and wetlands by lawn products, this legislation should enable the city to progress in achieving compliance with said state regulation. It is hereby noted that these landscape alternatives are no more or less appropriate than turf grass yard choices in regard to the visual appeal of individual properties. It is also important to note that the intent of this title is not to allow vegetated areas to be unmanaged. Control of noxious, invasive weeds shall be required in all landscape plans. 
(Ord. No. 1809A, § 1, 12-7-2010)  
13.10.020 - Natural landscape gardens allowed. 
(a)  A natural heritage garden, ornamental garden, rain garden and/or sustenance garden may be planted if it is in compliance with the following provisions:

(Ord. No. 1809A, § 1, 12-7-2010)  
13.10.030 - Notice of natural landscape garden. 
(a)  If any natural heritage garden, ornamental garden, rain garden, sustenance garden, or combination thereof, exceeds fifty percent of the surface area of the property not otherwise occupied by buildings, structures, or improvements, the owner shall file a notice with the director of public works. This notice shall contain: 
(1)  A drawing or sketch depicting the area of the garden relative to the property ownership lines, public right-of-way, buildings, and structures and improvements located on the property. The drawing need not be done to scale or prepared by professionals; 
(2)  Information indicating the general vegetation to be used within the plan and their approximate locations. 
(b)  The landscape garden plan shall be submitted to the director of public works for appropriate city staff review. If the plantings might suggest a negative impact on drainage, visibility or drainage easements the plan shall be changed or submitted to the garden landscape review board for further review. 
(c)  Information on planning an alternative landscape yard can be secured from the director of public works. A review of the costs and labor involved in the planting and maintenance of these yard alternatives may be discussed at that time. 
(d)  No fees shall be assessed for this review. 
(e)  If the garden(s) do not exceed fifty percent of the surface area as set forth above, the garden(s) shall be allowed without filing a notice, but shall still adhere to the other sections of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1809A, § 1, 12-7-2010)  
13.10.040 - Garden landscape review board.

(3)  That property management responsibilities have not been met by the property owner. 
(b)  This hearing must occur within thirty days following notification. 
(c)  This section shall not in any manner restrict the city's right to maintain trees and vegetation in city rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 1809A, § 1, 12-7-2010)  
13.10.070 - Pre-existing legal use exemption. 
Properties with natural landscape gardens in place in compliance with the above regulations at the time of the enactment of this title, which would be required to file a notice pursuant to [Section] 13.10.030, shall be exempt from the Section 13.10.030 notice requirement. In order to assist in the enforcement of this title, any owner claiming exempt status regarding the natural garden notice provisions called for herein shall register with the city clerk, on a form provided by the city clerk, within one hundred eighty days of the passage of this title by the common council.

The common council finds that there exists, and may in the future exist, within the city, buildings or structures that are likely to affect, by reason of their maintenance or lack of maintenance, the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of this community. It is declared that there is a need for the establishment of certain standards relating to the maintenance and repair of buildings, structures and surrounding areas. It is further declared that failure to maintain buildings and surrounding areas in a reasonable state of repair affects the value of other properties in the area, and adversely affects the environment and living conditions in the area.

(b)  However, any legally established use or structure existing prior to the effective date of this title that does not conform with the provisions of this title because of size of rooms, size of windows, height of ceilings or other basic structural dimensions shall be considered a legal nonconforming use under the provisions of Chapter 19.60 of this code. However, such nonconforming use of the structure shall not be extended, enlarged, moved or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order, or so as to comply with the provisions of this title. Normal maintenance is permitted. This provision shall not be interpreted to disallow the extension or enlargement of a structure in respect to those dimensions that are or may still be in conformance with this title so long as such extensions or enlargements do not thereby create additional nonconforming dimensions. 
(Ord. 1217 (9/17/91) §1(part), 1991).

Such service shall be set forth in the form of a written contract between the private alarm company and each subscriber. This paragraph, however, relates solely to annunciator panels, connections to annunciator panels by subscribers, and fees and charges related to the installation and maintenance of such panels.

(e)  All operators shall be trained to handle emergency messages. 
(f)  As soon as possible after notifying the police department, the operator concerned shall notify the subscriber involved of such action and the nature of the emergency message received. The alarm subscriber will provide the modified central station or the answering service with the names and telephone numbers of at least two other persons who can be reached at any time, day or night, and who are authorized to respond to an emergency signal transmitted by the automatic alarm device, and who can open the premises wherein the device is installed.

If an alarm business does, however, use an alarm system to protect its own premises, it shall contract for such system as required in this section. 
(b)  The alarm user applying for the contract required in subsection (a) of this section, shall state on a form to be prepared by the police department and approved by the city attorney: user's name, the address of the residence or business or businesses in or upon which the alarm system has been or will be installed, user's telephone number, the type of alarm system (local, direct connect, central station, etc.), the alarm business or businesses selling, installing, monitoring, inspecting and/or maintaining the alarm system, and the name and telephone number of persons who are owners or operators authorized to enter into such a contract.

(7)  The person/business to whom the false alarm fee has been assessed has the right to appeal the fee. All appeals must be submitted, in written form, to the police chief within ten days of the receipt of the false alarm report. The appellant shall include documentation explaining why the occurrence of the false alarm was beyond his/her reasonable control. 
Within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal the appellant will receive, from the police chief, or his designee, a written response. If the appellant is able to satisfactorily show that the false alarm was not the result of negligence, improper maintenance, or some other good and sufficient cause beyond his/her reasonable control, the fee may, in the sole discretion of the police chief, be waived. In this event the response shall not count as a false alarm in computing the fee established by municipal ordinance.

14.14.120 - False alarms. 
(a)  More than three false alarms in a twelve-month period from any alarm system for which an alarm contract has been obtained may constitute grounds for revocation of such contract, subject to the provisions of this section.

If, however, the alarm user, by reason of absence from the city or on any other reasonable basis requests an extension of time to file the report, the police chief shall extend the fifteen-day period for a reasonable period. If the alarm user fails to submit such a report within fifteen days or within any such extended period, the police chief may revoke the contract. 
(c)  If the alarm user submits a report as required by subsection (b) of this section but the police chief determines that the report is unsatisfactory or that the alarm user has failed to show by the report that he has taken or will take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce false alarms, then the police chief may issue written notice by first class mail of his revocation of the alarm user's contract. 
(d)  If after submission of a report required by subsection (b) of this section which is satisfactory to the police chief, the alarm system of the contract holder incurs one or more false alarms during the same calendar year, the police chief may issue written notice by first class mail of his revocation of the alarm user's contract. 
(e)  An alarm system user whose contract has been revoked is not precluded under this section from applying for a new contract. The city, however, is not required to issue a new contract unless it is satisfied that the alarm user's system has been properly serviced and its deficiencies corrected. The police chief may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions upon issuing a new contract to an alarm user with respect to the particular system for which the contract was revoked.

15.12.010 - General provisions. 
(a)  Historical Records. Under Section 19.21(4)(a) Wis.Stats., municipalities must notify the State Historical Society of Wisconsin (SHSW) prior to destroying records. However, the SHSW has waived the required sixty-day notice for certain records. This title uses the following abbreviations to set forth the SHSW requirements: 
(1)  For any record marked "W," SHSW has waived notice. 
(2)  SHSW must be notified prior to destruction of a record marked "N" (non-waived). 
(3)  "N/A" indicates not applicable and applies to any record designated for permanent retention. 
(4)  Notice is required for any record not listed in this title. 
(b)  Microfilming of Records. Local units of government may keep and preserve public records through the use of microfilm providing the microfilm meets the applicable standards in Wis. Stats. 16.61(7). Retention periods and estimated costs and benefits of converting records between different media should be considered in deciding which records to microfilm. After verification, paper records converted to microfilm should be destroyed. The retention periods identified in this title apply to records in any media: 
Optical disk may be used when it is expressly authorized in the statutes for local government use. 
(c)  Destruction After Request for Inspection. No requested records may be destroyed until after the request is granted or sixty days after the request is denied. If an action is commenced under Section 19.37 Wis. Stats., the requested record may not be destroyed until after a court order is issued and all appeals have been completed. See Section 19.35(5) Wis. Stats. 
(d)  Destruction Pending Litigation. No record subject to pending litigation shall be destroyed until the litigation is resolved. 
(e)  Review and Approval By Public Records and Forms Board. 
(f)  Electronic Records. This title applies to public records regardless of their form. Accordingly, electronic public records must be retained in compliance with the same schedules applicable to documents.

P stands for permanent retention. 
"Time" is expressed in years unless specifically identified as month or day. 
"Authority" refers to any specific statutory, administrative rule, or specific regulation that determines retention of the record. In most cases this will be blank because units of government have discretion to establish a time period.

16.04.095 - Private well abandonment. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to prevent unused and/or improperly constructed wells from serving as a passage for contaminated surface or near-surface waters or other materials to reach the usable groundwater. These wells must be properly filled and sealed. 
All private wells located on any premises which is served by the public water system of the city shall be properly filled within ninety days of receiving written notice that the existing well does not meet standards set forth here. Only those wells for which a well operation permit has been granted by the city may be exempted from this requirement; subject to conditions of maintenance and operation. 
A permit may be granted to a well owner to operate a well for a period not to exceed five years if the following requirements are met. Application shall be made on forms provided by the city: 
The well and pump installation meet the requirements of Chapter NR 112, Wisconsin Administrative Code, and a well constructor's report is on file with the department of natural resources, or certification of the acceptability of the well has been granted by the private water supply section of the department of natural resources; 
The well has a history of producing safe water and presently produces bacteriologically safe water, as evidenced by three samplings two weeks apart; 
The proposed use of the well can be justified as being necessary in addition to water provided by the public water system; 
No physical connection shall exist between the piping of the public water system and the private well. 
Wells to be Abandoned. All wells abandoned under the jurisdiction of this section or rule shall be abandoned according to the procedures and methods of Chapter NR 112, Wis. Adm. Code. All debris, pump, piping, unsealed liners and any other obstructions which may interfere with sealing operations shall be removed prior to abandonment. 
The owner of the well, or the owner's agent, shall notify the city at least two business days prior to commencement of any well abandonment activities. The abandonment of the well shall be observed by the water superintendent or his or her agent. 
An abandonment report form, supplied by the department of natural resources, shall be submitted by the well owner to the city and the department of natural resources within ten days of the completion of the well abandonment. 
Any person, firm or corporation or other well owner violating any provision of this section shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars together with the cost of prosecution. Each twenty-four-hour period during which a violation exists shall be deemed and constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. 1068 § 1, 1985; Ord. 1324 §§ 1, 2, 1995; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.100 - Water use—Permit required. 
The law forbids free service, hence no water shall be taken without proper permit. Parties desiring to introduce water on their premises must make formal application to the water office and sign an application card or permit constituting a contract for water supplied and its specific use, which contract embodies these regulations as part of the same. 
(Prior code § 11.10; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.110 - Tapping mains. 
No person unless authorized by the utility shall be permitted to tap or make any connection with any street main or distribution pipe.

16.04.120 - Service connections. 
(a)  Each applicant for water service shall at the time of making application for such water service execute and deliver to the utility a contract for such water service, agreeing to put in the service pipe from the curb line to each piece of water-using property existing at that point and owned by applicant where such water is desired, at the expense of such applicant and to commence the payment of such water service sometime within one month from the laying of such main in front of the premises named in such application. 
The water main shall be tapped by the utility and all pipes and fittings, up to and including the curb box and necessary connections, will be furnished and installed at a cost established by the department of public works, not including digging the trench. 
(Prior code § 11.12; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.130 - Laying services. 
(a)  Application for water service shall be made in writing. The application will contain the legal description of the property to be served, name of the owner, the exact use to be made of the service and the size of the supply pipe and meter desired. 
Service will be furnished only if: 
Premises have frontage on a properly platted street or public strip in which a cast iron or other long-life water main has been laid, or where property owner has agreed to and complied with the provisions of the utility's filed main extension rule; 
Each building must have one distinct and separate tap and service pipe laid not less than six feet below the surface after the street is brought to a grade. Multi-units within a building shall have individual shut off valves made accessible to water utilities. Each service must be provided with a stop cock and metal extension box outside of the premises connected with the same. 
Supply pipes shall not be laid across adjacent parcels whether owned by the same or different parties. Every service pipe where it enters the building shall be furnished with a stop cock. 
Any new building, premises or lot contained in a commercially zoned district shall be required to install a minimum of a one and one-half inch water service at the expense of the property owner. Such one and one-half inch requirement shall apply even if it can be demonstrated that such a size service is not necessary for the building's present needs. In such event, however, if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utility that a smaller service line would satisfy the needs adequately, then the service lateral may be reduced. 
No division of the water service of any lot or parcel of land shall be made for the extension and independent meterage of the supply to an adjoining lot or parcel of land. 
The utility is empowered to withhold approval of any application wherein full information of the purpose of such supply is not clearly indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner. 
(Prior code § 11.13; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.140 - Repairs to services. 
(a)  The service pipe from the main to the curb will be maintained and kept in repair at the expense of the utility. However, it is the duty of the consumer to maintain the service pipe from the curb to the point of use and the utility cannot be called upon to stand the loss of water which has passed through the meter and has been wasted by leakage of defective pipes and fixtures. 
If a consumer fails to repair a leaky or broken service pipe from the curb to the house within such time as may appear reasonable to the director of public works, after notification has been served on the consumer by the director of public works, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed. 
(Prior code § 11.14; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.150 - Stop boxes—Protection.

(Prior code § 11.15; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.160 - Turning on water. 
The water cannot be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized employee of the utility. When a plumber has completed a job, the water must remain turned off. This does not prevent testing of the work. 
(Prior code § 11.17; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.170 - Meters—Installation. 
Meters will be furnished by the utility. All meters shall be so located that they shall be preserved from obstructions and allow easy access thereto for reading and inspection, such locations to be designated by the director of public works. 
(Prior code § 11.18; Ord. 748 § 2, 1972; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)

(a)  In installing new service piping if meters are to be set, the consumer shall, at their own expense, provide the proper connections for the meter. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, meter horn shall be inserted after the main valve, then a house valve on the opposite side of the meter horn shall be installed for maintenance. 
In the installation of new water services and in the replacement of old water services, no main house water supply line shall be smaller than one inch. 
Water consumers are not permitted to interfere in any way with the meter after it is set in place. In case the meter seal is broken or the working parts of the meter have been tampered with or the meter damaged, the utility will render a bill for the current period based on historical consumption or another reasonable basis. Such consumer will be liable to the penalty provided in Wis. Stats. § 943.20 (Theft) for illegal use of water. 
No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the utility. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made impervious to moisture. 
In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling, free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material, around and at least twelve inches below and over the pipe. 
All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously. 
(Prior code § 11.20; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.200 - Meters—Repairs. 
(a)  Meters will be repaired by the water department and the cost of such repairs caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the utility. 
Any damage which a meter may sustain resulting from the carelessness of the owner of the premises, agent or tenant, or from the negligence of either of them to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that may result from allowing the meter to become frozen or to be injured from hot water or steam setting back from a boiler, shall be paid to the utility by the consumer of the water or the owner of the premises. 
(Prior code § 11.21; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.210 - Meters—Testing. 
(a)  Every meter installation must be thoroughly tested for accuracy of registration according to public service commission ruling. 
Every water consumer or utility patron shall be entitled to have their meter retested by public service commission rule. 
In the event that a water meter is found to be defective in its operation to the extent of an over-registration of more than two percent, the water utility shall adjust the consumer's billing in the following manner: 
Consumer shall be billed in an amount equal to the amount charged for the service in the same time frame of the previous year. 
(Prior code § 11.22; Ord. 627 § 1, 1969; Ord. 738 § 3, 1972; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.215 - Multi-unit building regulations. 
(a)  Proposed new multi-unit buildings (duplexes, townhouses, strip malls, and other like structures) designed with separate entrances and living, work or commercial area on the ground floor, will generally have an individual service to each unit, with a curb stop and curb box adjacent to a public sidewalk, along with individual meter and remote reader. Each unit will be considered a separate utility customer. Alternatively they may choose one of the options in (b). 
(b)  Other types of proposed new multi-unit buildings (e.g. apartments) will generally be supplied from a single large service. The owner may choose to install individual metered service to each unit. The owner is then required to provide interior plumbing and meter settings to enable individual metered service to each unit and individual disconnection without affecting service to the other units. All meters shall be contained in a separate locked room or area accessible only to utility and management personnel to ensure the integrity of the meter readings. Each meter and meter connection will be a separate water utility customer. Alternatively the owner may choose to install a large meter serving the multi-unit dwelling with the owner being responsible for all charges. 
(Ord. 1204 § 1(part), 1991; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)

16.04.230 - Boilers—Failure of supply. 
Consumers taking water from supplying boilers for generating steam or for other general use and depending upon the water main pressure for supply will do so at their own risk, and the utility shall not be liable for any damages because of the lack of pressure or failure of supply. 
(Prior code § 11.24; Ord. No. 1972A, § 1, 4-4-2020)  
16.04.240 - Repairs to mains. 
The water utility reserves the right to shut off supply in the mains temporarily to make repairs, alterations, or additions to the works or pipes.

Chapter 16.10 - STORMWATER UTILITY AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
Sections: 
 
16.10.010 - Purpose and necessity—Authorization. 
The common council of the City of Whitewater find that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond Whitewater Creek, Tripp Lake, Cravath Lake, and other bodies of water within the city is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. All real property in the city, including property owned by public and tax-exempt entities contributes runoff and either uses or benefits from the stormwater system. 
Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause nonpoint source pollution, erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the city. A system for the collection and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the City of Whitewater and surrounding areas, including those properties not currently served by the system. The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the common council exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services. 
In promulgating the regulations contained in this chapter, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by Chapters 62 and 66 of the Wisconsin Statutes, including, but not limited to, Sections 62.04, 62.11, 62.16(2), 62.18, 66.0101, 66.0621, 66.080, 66.0811, 66.0813, 66.0703, and 66.0627. 
(Ord. 1672A (part), 2008: Ord. 1647A (part), 2007).  
16.10.020 - Creation. 
There is created and established a stormwater utility within the City of Whitewater, effective October 1, 2007. The entire operation, charge and management of the stormwater utility is vested in the city manager, subject, however, to the general control and supervision of the common council, pursuant to applicable state law. 
(Ord. 1672A (part), 2008: Ord. 1647A (part), 2007).  
16.10.030 - Authority.

16.10.070 - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Every person shall pay the applicable Whitewater stormwater service charge when due for each property owned by that person. 
(b)  The basis for computation of the charge for stormwater services to lots and parcels of land within the city is established under this section. The amount of charge to be imposed, the establishment of formulas for the calculation of charges, the creation of customer classifications for the imposition of charges, and changes in such charges, formulas and customer classifications shall be consistent with this chapter. Each year the city manager shall determine the value of one ERU based upon the applicable year's adopted city budget and this chapter, and shall certify such value to the city clerk/treasurer and common council. All charges established pursuant to this chapter shall be fair and reasonable. A schedule of current charges shall be maintained and on file in the office of the city clerk/treasurer. 
(c)  Charges shall be imposed to recover all or a portion of the costs of the stormwater utility. Such charges may include, but are not limited to, the following components: 
(1)  Base Component. The base component shall include the stormwater utility's estimated annual administrative and management costs, water quality costs, and other costs not in the components described below. The base rate shall be calculated by taking the sum of all base component costs and dividing that by the estimated number of billable ERU's. 
(2)  Operation and Maintenance Component. The operation and maintenance component shall include the stormwater utility's estimated annual operation and maintenance costs for the city's stormwater management system. The operation and maintenance rate shall be determined by: (A) taking the sum of all operation and maintenance component costs, (B) dividing that amount by the ERU's remaining after the ERU's that the city, upon user application, has determined need not pay operation and maintenance component costs, and (C) making appropriate adjustments to the rate to account for factors such as changes in stormwater reserves. 
(3)  Capital and Debt Service Component. The capital and debt service component cost shall include the capital costs and debt service payments for the city's stormwater conveyance system, including retention and detention facilities. The capital and debt service rate shall be determined by: (A) taking the sum of all capital and debt service component costs, (B) dividing that amount by the ERU's remaining after the ERU's which the city, upon user application, has determined need not pay capital and debt service component costs, and (C) making appropriate adjustments to the rate to account for factors such as changes in stormwater reserves. 
(d)  Credits or adjustments may be available to individual property owners in the residential and multifamily customer classes. It shall be the burden of the property owner to request such a credit and to demonstrate to a reasonable degree of certainty with evidence that a fee adjustment is warranted. The credits or adjustments shall be applied to the operation and maintenance component costs and the capital and debt service component costs. The base component shall be charged to all properties regardless of credits unless the property is regulated by a separate municipal stormwater discharge permit (WPDES). A stormwater credit system credit policy has been approved by the city council for applicants to refer to. All applications for credit or adjustments shall be reviewed by the director and the director may reduce the measured impervious area after taking into consideration the demonstrated reduction in stormwater volume. Credits or adjustments may be applied to applicable properties based upon two criteria: 
(1)  An adjustment may be applicable if some or all of a customer's property provided, (A) stormwater runoff from the property does not discharge directly or indirectly to or through any form of conveyance system owned or operated by the stormwater utility, and (B) the drainage from the property is not in violation of any environmental code or federal, state or local surface water drainage requirements. 
(2)  Credits may be granted to owners of properties who have significantly reduced the impacts of stormwater discharge on the stormwater utility system. Owners of property which discharge all or a portion of their stormwater into privately owned and maintained retention and detention ponds shall receive a prorated credit to the number of ERUs assigned to their property as determined by the director. No owner may be given a credit in excess of fifty percent of their total number of ERUs. 
(3)  Prior to receiving a credit or adjustment, the director or designee shall be allowed access to the property to determine the amount of credit or exemption to be granted. 
(Ord. 1672A (part), 2008: Ord. 1647A (part), 2007).

Chapter 16.16 - POST-CONSTRUCTION RUNOFF 
Sections: 
 
16.16.010 - Authority. 
This chapter is adopted by the City of Whitewater under the authority granted by Section 62.234, Wis. Stats. This chapter supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under Section 62.23, Wis. Stats., that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Section 62.234, Wis. Stats., Section 62.23, Wis. Stats., applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter. 
The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body. 
The City of Whitewater hereby designates the director of public works to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
The requirements of this chapter to not pre-empt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(a)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Sections 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats. 
(b)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under Section NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code. 
(Ord. 1559A §1, 2004).  
16.16.020 - Findings of fact. 
The City of Whitewater finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(a)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature; 
(b)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants; 
(c)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads; 
(d)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
(e)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities; 
(f)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes;

(Ord. 1559A §2, 2004).  
16.16.030 - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The general purpose of this chapter is to establish long-term, post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth; 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(b)  Intent. It is the intent of the City of Whitewater that this chapter regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This chapter may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The City of Whitewater recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Section 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the City of Whitewater, it is the intent of this chapter that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community. 
(Ord. 1559A §3, 2004).  
16.16.040 - Applicability and jurisdiction. 
(a)  Applicability. 
(1)  Where not otherwise limited by law, this chapter applies to land development activity that results in twenty thousand square feet or more of land disturbing construction activity or results in a net increase of ten thousand square feet or more of impervious surface, including areas that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale where multiple separate and distinct land disturbing construction activities may be taking place at different times on different schedules but under one plan.

Notification shall also be given to the city clerk, building inspector, city assessor and plan commission. 
(4)  Any decision of the commission, pursuant to this title may be appealed by the owner of the affected property to the city council for its determination. 
(5)  If the owner of the property objects to the proposed designation, he shall file a written objection to the designation with the commission on or before the hearing.

Such petition shall contain an affidavit under oath that the person has made reasonable attempts in good faith to find and attract such a buyer, as well as such further information deemed reasonably necessary by the commission for the purpose of evaluating the petition. 
(b)  Following the filing of such petition, the owner and the commission shall work together for up to six months to try to locate a buyer for the subject property who is willing to comply with the designation. If at the end of six months no such buyer can be found, and if the owner still desires to obtain such rescission, the commission shall rescind its designation of the subject property. 
(c)  In the event of rescission, the commission shall notify the city clerk, building inspector and assessor of same, and shall cause the rescission to be recorded at city expense in the Walworth County register of deeds.

(e)  Before the landmarks commission explores a city owned property as a potential landmark, the commission shall notify the city manager with a notice of intent. The city manager shall then include the notice of the requested designation on the agenda of a common council meeting, that is held within thirty days of the notice, and provide the common council with its option to object to the designation under Section 17.12.020(5). 
The common council shall not be required to act on the proposed designation; however, if at the meeting, a majority of the voting common council members vote to object to the designation, the landmarks commission shall dismiss the proposal.

Chapter 17.16 - CONSTRUCTION AND ALTERATION 
Sections: 
 
17.16.010 - Building permit—Required. 
No person shall alter, reconstruct, move or permit any alteration of any exterior or reconstruction or movement of any exterior portion of any landmark or landmark site or any property within an historic district unless the commission has approved such work. Unless the commission has approved such work, the building inspector shall not issue a building permit for such work. 
(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(9)(2), 1982).

17.16.030 - Building permit—Application—Determination by commission. 
Upon the filing of an application, the commission shall determine whether the proposed work would destroy or deleteriously affect any feature of the landmark or landmark site, or be out of harmony with the external appearance of the site. 
(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(9)(c), 1982).  
17.16.040 - Building permit—Issuance procedure. 
The commission shall within thirty days of referral report to the building inspector either that the permit is denied or that the commission has no objection to the issuance of the permit. The commission may attach certain conditions to the approval of the request. Review of denial of permits shall lie with the common council pursuant to this code and the Wisconsin Statutes. The applicant may appeal the decision to the city council for its determination.

17.16.060 - Criteria for existing structures. 
"The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects" dated 1980 (rev.) shall apply to reconstruction and exterior alterations to existing structures. Those standards are as follows: 
(1)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(2)  All buildings, structures and sites should be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations which have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
(3)  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development in a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance should be recognized and respected. 
(4)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site should be treated with sensitivity. 
(5)  Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(6)  The surface cleaning of structures should be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(7)  Every reasonable effort should be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any acquisition, protection, stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction project. 
(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(10)(a), 1982).  
17.16.070 - Criteria for new construction. 
For new construction within a historic district, the following criteria shall apply: 
(1)  The mass, volume and setback of proposed structures should appear to be compatible with existing buildings in the immediate area. 
(2)  The facade of new structures should maintain a compatible relationship with those of existing structures in terms of window sill or header lines; proportion of window and door openings; horizontal or vertical emphasis of major building elements; and extent of architectural detail. 
(3)  The building materials and colors used should complement and be compatible with other buildings in the immediate area. 
(4)  The sizing, design and placement of signs should fit the building and the adjacent structures. 
(5)  All landscaping and parking provisions should complement and be compatible with improvements in the immediate area. 
(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(10)(b), 1982).  
17.16.080 - Criteria for alteration or disposal of historically significant personal property. 
Once personal property has been designated historically significant personal property by the landmarks commission, it shall not be altered or disposed of by the city without permission by the landmarks commission or, in the alternative, by action of the city council. Prior to authorizing the disposition or alteration of the historically significant personal property, the city council shall receive and consider the recommendation of the landmarks commission. The landmarks commission shall issue a recommendation within sixty days of a written request. If the landmarks commission fails to issue a recommendation within sixty days, the council may act on the request without considering the landmarks commission's recommendation. 
(Ord. No. 1733A, § 5, 6-2-2009)  
Chapter 17.20 - DEMOLITION 
Sections: 
 
17.20.010 - Building permit—Required. 
No person shall demolish all or part of a landmark, improvement of a landmark site, or improvement in an historic district, unless the commission has approved such work. Unless the commission has approved the work, the building inspector shall not issue a building permit for such work. 
(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(11)(2), 1982).  
17.20.020 - Building permit—Application. 
When a person applies for a permit to demolish such property, such application shall also be filed with the commission. 
(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(11)(b), 1982).  
17.20.030 - Building permit—Issuance.

(Ord. 999 §1(3)(b)(11)(c), 1982).  
Chapter 17.24 - APPEALS 
Sections: 
 
17.24.010 - Generally. 
An appeal of an action of the landmarks commission relating to designation of landmarks or creation of historic districts; the regulation of construction, reconstruction or exterior alteration; or the regulation of demolition may be initiated by filing a petition to appeal, specifying the grounds for such appeal, with the city clerk within ten days of the date on which the final decision of the landmarks commission is made. The city clerk shall file the petition to appeal with the city council. After a public hearing, the city council may, by a favorable vote of two-thirds of its members, reverse or modify the decision of the landmarks commission. In modifying or reversing a decision of the landmarks commission, the city council shall find that owing to special conditions the decision of the landmarks commission would cause serious hardship to the property owner or preclude reasonable use of the property. Self-created hardship or expectation of increased economic return shall not be the basis for modifying or reversing a decision of the landmarks commission.

Monuments disturbed or not placed have penalties as provided for in Wisconsin Statutes, Section 236.32. An assessor's plat made under Wisconsin Statutes, Section 70.27 may be ordered by the city at the expense of the subdivider when a subdivision is created by successive divisions. 
(f)  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to laws. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. 
(g)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by Wisconsin Statutes. 
(h)  Severability. If any section, provision or portion of this chapter is judged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(i)  Repeal. All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the city inconsistent or conflicting with this chapter, to the extent of the inconsistency only, are repealed.

(k)  Effective Date. The ordinance codified herein shall be effective after a public hearing, adoption by the city council and publication or posting as provided by law. 
(l)  Exceptions and Waivers. 
(1)  General. Where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve exceptions and waivers to these subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided the exception or waiver shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the plan commission shall not approve exceptions and waivers unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it that all of the following conditions are met by the petitioner: 
(A)  The granting of the exception or waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property; 
(B)  The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; 
(C)  Because of the location or conditions affecting the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; 
(D)  The relief sought will not materially alter the provisions of the comprehensive (master) plan, zoning ordinance, or official map, except that those documents may be amended in the manner prescribed by law. 
(2)  Conditions. In approving exceptions or waivers, the plan commission may require such conditions as will in its judgement secure substantially the purposes described in Section 18.04.010. 
(3)  Procedures. A petition for an exception or waiver shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat or certified survey map is filed for the consideration of the plan commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner. Except as specified elsewhere in this chapter, a three-fourths vote of the entire membership of the city plan commission shall be required to grant any exceptions or waivers to this chapter. 
(m)  Land Suitability. No land shall be subdivided for residential use which is held unsuitable for such use by the city plan commission for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community. The city plan commission, in applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if he so desires. Thereafter, the city plan commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. 
(n)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an objection to a plat or a failure to approve a plat may appeal therefrom, as provided in Wisconsin Statutes, Sections 62.23(7)(e) 10 to 15 and 236.13(5) within thirty days of notification of the rejection of the plat. Where failure to approve is based on an unsatisfied objection, the agency making the objection shall be made a party to the action. The court shall direct that the plat be approved if it finds that the action of the approving or objecting agency is arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory.

(Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.030 - Public lands and open spaces. 
(a)  Provision of Public Lands and Open Spaces. The city shall require the dedication of land, moneys in lieu of land, and improvement fees for parks and other public lands according to the following criteria: 
(1)  Land Dedication Formula. After consultation with the park and recreation commission, the city plan commission shall determine whether the dedication of land for parks or moneys in lieu thereof will better serve the public interest. Where land is to be dedicated, at least one thousand forty-seven square feet of land shall be dedicated for each residential dwelling unit proposed. If no particular number of dwelling units is proposed, the requirements shall be based on the number of dwelling units permitted by right under the proposed subdivision and the then existing zoning. 
(2)  Moneys in Lieu of Land Dedication. Where, after consultation with the park and recreation commission, the plan commission determines that money in lieu of land is to be paid, the amount of money shall be on a basis of two hundred eighteen dollars in 2002 per residential unit permitted by right under the proposed subdivision and the then existing zoning. This fee amount shall be adjusted during the first quarter of each year by a percentage equal to that of the rate of consumer inflation based on the percent of yearly change for the previous year for the Milwaukee metropolitan area as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
(3)  Park Improvement Fee. In addition to all of the above, a park improvement fee of five hundred fourteen dollars in 2002 shall be paid for each dwelling unit proposed. If no particular number of dwellings units is proposed, the requirements shall be based on the number of dwelling units permitted by right under the proposed subdivision and the then existing zoning. The city shall hold these moneys in reserve to be used for park improvement purposes. This fee amount shall be adjusted during the first quarter of each year by a percentage equal to that of the rate of consumer inflation based on the percent of yearly change for the previous year for the Milwaukee metropolitan area as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
(b)  Specifications for Dedicated Land. 
(1)  Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land except where the city plan commission determines that two parcels or more would be in the public interest. 
(2)  Shape. The shape of the dedicated parcel of land shall be sufficiently square or round to be usable for recreational activities, such as softball, tennis or soccer. 
(3)  Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the recreation and open space needs of the subdivision for which the dedication was made. 
(4)  Access. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided by adjoining street frontage of sufficient width to assure safe, comfortable access to the dedicated land and protection of nearby private properties. In unique situations, the plan commission and park and recreation commission may permit access via public access easement to the dedicated parcel. The easement shall be sufficiently wide so that the public and maintenance equipment will have reasonably convenient access to the land. 
(5)  Usability. The dedicated land shall be usable for recreation, as determined by the park and recreation commission. Wetland and stormwater management areas may be considered usable for recreational purposes if such areas provide a meaningful recreational amenity for the neighborhood as determined by the park and recreation commission, rather than simply fulfilling regulatory requirements. Where the park and recreation commission determines that the recreational needs are being adequately met, either by other dedicated parcels of land or existing recreational facilities, then the park and recreation commission and plan commission may allow land that is not usable for recreation to be dedicated and credited against park land dedication requirements. Except for natural areas as defined by the park and recreation director, the subdivider shall grade, topsoil, and seed the land for its intended use before it will be accepted by the city. 
(6)  Plans. If specifically designated on the comprehensive (master) plan, comprehensive plan component, official map, or component neighborhood development plan, such park areas shall be made a part of the plat to the extent allowed under this section. If not so designated, consideration shall be given in the location of such sites to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of fine trees, marshes, lakes and ponds, watercourses, watersheds, natural prairies and ravines. 
(c)  Allocation of Moneys in Lieu of Dedicated Land and Park Improvement Fees. The city, when receiving moneys in lieu of dedicated land and park improvement fees, shall hold these moneys in separate reserve accounts to be used, respectively, for purchasing land for parks and other public open spaces and improving such lands. Where possible, these moneys shall be spent to directly fill the needs of the subdivision which generated the moneys. However, where such a practice could result in insufficient funds for any one improvement, then a set of priorities for improvements shall be established by city council resolution. These priorities shall rank order the planned acquisitions or and/or improvements. Each project or land acquisition shall be identified by the general area it is to serve. Each subdivision contributing to the general reserve funds shall be shown as planned to be benefited by one of the projects in the list of priorities unless that subdivision is already adequately served. 
(d)  Credit for Private Open Space. Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, such areas shall be credited against the requirement of public land dedication for park and recreation purposes, as set forth above in this subsection or the payment of fees in lieu thereof; provided that the city park and recreation commission and plan commission find it is in the public interest to do so, and that the following standards are met: 
(1)  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; 
(2)  The private ownership and maintenance of the open space must be adequately provided for by written agreement between the city and property owner or by recorded covenant; 
(3)  The use of the private open space must be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants that run in favor of the future owners of property within the tract and the city and that cannot be eliminated without the consent of the city council, following a recommendation from the park and recreation commission; and 
(4)  The proposed open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location of the private open space land. 
(e)  Credit for Improvements within Private Open Space. Where private open space is used to satisfy all or part of the city's park land dedication requirements, and the subdivider agrees to install improvements within the park, such as play equipment or athletic facilities, the value of such improvements may be credited against the requirement for park improvement fees, as set forth in this subsection; provided that the city park and recreation commission and plan commission find it is in the public interest to do so. 
(f)  Additional Park Land Shown on City Plans. Whenever a proposed park or other public open space land designated on the city's comprehensive (master) plan or component thereof is within a proposed subdivision, and the amount of public land suggested by said city plan is in excess of the required park land dedication requirements set forth in this subsection, the city will attempt to work with the subdivider during the concept plan and preliminary plat review stages of the subdivision to negotiate the purchase of said land. If the city elects not to purchase said land before or within this time period, then the plat need not comply with the city's comprehensive (master) plan with respect to this park land standard only. 
(g)  Lands within Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. If public dedication is not required by another governmental jurisdiction with authority, proposed public lands outside of the corporate limits of the city but within the extraterritorial jurisdiction may be reserved within outlots or public access easements if such land is identified as park or other public open space land within the city's comprehensive (master) plan subsections (a)(1), (b), (f) and (h) of this section shall provide guidance to the city in its review of all park reservations, easements, or dedications within extraterritorial subdivisions. 
(h)  Access to Waterways and Drainage Ways. A subdivision abutting a navigable waterway shall, according to the provisions of Wisconsin Statutes, Section 236.16(3), provide access at least sixty feet wide to the low water mark so that there will be public access, which is connected to existing public roads, at one-half-mile intervals as measured along the lake or stream shore except where greater intervals and wider access is agreed upon by the State of Wisconsin, and excluding shore areas where public parks or open space, streets, or roads on either side of a stream are provided. When immediately surrounding land is included in a final plat or certified survey map, the city shall require a public access easement, reservation, or land dedication along navigable waterways where public access is recommended by the city's comprehensive (master) plan or components thereof, with such easement or dedication being of sufficient width to accommodate the level of access anticipated. Such dedication, easement, or reservation may be credited against the park land dedication requirements specified in this subsection. 
(Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.040 - Procedure—Site assessment checklist and concept plan. 
(a)  Preliminary Procedure. Before filing an application for approval of a preliminary plat or certified survey map, the subdivider shall prepare the following, unless exempted by other sections of this chapter: 
(1)  A site assessment checklist per the requirements of subsection (d) of this section. A site assessment report per the requirements of subsection (e) may also be required, following plan commission review of the site assessment checklist. 
(2)  For projects which will require the filing of a preliminary and final plat, a concept plan per the requirements of subsection (f). 
(3)  Written requests to the director of public works for any water main and sanitary sewer extensions necessary to serve the proposed subdivision. 
(4)  A signed statement listing development projects for which the applicant has both received city approval in the last five years and has outstanding performance or financial obligations. If this statement is found to contain information which is contrary to fact or to omit the listing of such projects or obligations on which performance or payment is delinquent, the application may be dismissed without prejudice until the application is corrected and/or the delinquency is cured. 
(b)  Preapplication Meeting. On the completion of the documents specified in subsection (a), a preapplication meeting may be required by the zoning administrator and director of public works to assist the subdivider in appraising the objectives of these regulations, the city's comprehensive (master) plan and elements thereof, the city's official map and any pertinent ordinances and plans, and to reach conclusions regarding the objectives and general program for the proposed development. 
(c)  Plan Commission and Park and Recreation Commission Review. The subdivider may revise the submitted documents per the direction of the city zoning administrator and director of public works. Thirty copies of said revised documents shall be submitted by the subdivider to the city zoning administrator who shall distribute the copies to the city plan commission and park and recreation commission for review and comment. Said copies must be submitted at least ten days prior to the date of the plan commission or park and recreation commission meeting at which the matter is to be reviewed. The subdivider may request a formal vote of either commission on the submitted concept plan, but such vote shall not be binding on the city in its review of future preliminary or final plats that may follow. 
(d)  Site Assessment Checklist Requirements. A site assessment checklist shall be prepared by the subdivider for review by the city plan commission. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the site assessment checklist is to provide the basis for an orderly, systematic review of the effects of all new subdivisions upon the community in accordance with the principles and procedures of Section 236.45(1), Wisconsin Statutes. The city plan commission will use these procedures in determining land suitability under Section 18.04.010(m). 
(2)  Coverage. The site assessment checklist requirement shall apply to all subdivisions. The city plan commission may waive this requirement for the filing of a site assessment checklist for minor subdivisions of less than five acres total area.

(e)  Site Assessment Report Requirements. 
(1)  Determination of Need for Site Assessment Report. The plan commission may, for reasons stated in a written resolution setting forth specific questions on which it requires research, data and input from the developer and other affected persons, decide that the site assessment checklist raises unusually significant questions on the effects on the environment and/or that an unusually high level of citizen interest has resulted from questions raised in the site assessment checklist and that review by other city committees and commissions is required. The listing of questions can include items which this ordinance already enables the commission to obtain, or it may include additional information which is relevant to the questions from other governmental agencies or the public. The resolution shall set a reasonable date for the return of the requested data and information from the subdivider, and it may specify the format in which the data is to be presented. 
(2)  Hearing on Site Assessment Report. Following the return to the plan commission of the data required in the resolution, the commission shall make such report available for scrutiny by all interested persons or agencies. The plan commission may schedule and hold a public hearing on the findings of the report. If scheduled, the hearing shall be preceded by a Class I notice under Chapter 985, Wisconsin Statutes. Persons attending such hearing shall be afforded an opportunity to comment on the report. 
(3)  Review of Site Assessment Report. The plan commission shall review the site assessment report, with supporting data, department and committee reviews and any other data required for determining the suitability of the land for the proposed development. Within thirty days after submission to the plan commission of the final expanded site assessment report by the subdivider, the plan commission shall decide whether said land is suitable for development. If determined unsuitable, the plan commission shall provide its reasons in writing, and subdivider shall have the opportunity to remedy the reasons before a certified survey map or preliminary plat may be filed. 
(f)  Concept Plan Requirements. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the concept plan is to depict the general intent of the subdivider in terms of general layout of the subdivision and its relationship to nearby properties, roads, utilities and other public facilities. In conjunction with the site assessment checklist, the concept plan provides an opportunity to review the general intent and impact of the proposed subdivision, without the need for detailed engineering, surveying, and other time consuming and costly processes associated with the preparation of a preliminary plat. 
(2)  Coverage. The concept plan requirement shall apply to all major subdivisions, and shall cover all contiguous lands owned or controlled by the subdivider, except for lands that are completely or nearly completely separated from the proposed subdivision area by substantial areas of undevelopable open space or pre-existing public roads. The zoning administrator shall waive the requirement for the filing of a concept plan for all or part of the proposed subdivision area where he finds that the proposed layout is in substantial conformance to a detailed neighborhood development plan previously adopted as a component of the city's comprehensive (master) plan. 
(Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.042 - Procedure—Preliminary plat. 
(a)  Preliminary Plat Review Procedure. 
(1)  Application. Prior to submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and file a written application for its approval with the secretary of the plan commission, along with thirty copies of the preliminary plat. The submittal shall include all data required by this section. A preliminary plat shall not be submitted prior to plan commission review of the site assessment checklist (or when required, the site assessment report), nor before plan commission review of the concept plan when required in Section 18.04.040. The preliminary plat shall be filed at least thirty days prior to the date of the plan commission meeting at which action is expected to allow adequate time for review and recommendation by appropriate agencies, staff, commissions, and consultants. 
(2)  Coverage of Preliminary Plat. The preliminary plat shall include the entire contiguous area owned and controlled by the subdivider, except in one or more of the following circumstances: 
(A)  The proposed preliminary plat is consistent with a detailed neighborhood development plan adopted as a component of the city's comprehensive (master) plan, or 
(B)  The previously submitted concept plan included all contiguous lands owned or controlled by the subdivider or condominium developer, and was of sufficient detail for the Plan Commission to clearly discern the subdivider's intent and the relationship of the proposed subdivision to surrounding properties, or 
(C)  Portions of the entire contiguously owned area are completely or nearly completely separated from lands that the subdivider intends to subdivide by substantial areas of undevelopable open space or pre-existing public roads. 
(3)  Review by Agencies. The plan commission secretary shall, within two days after filing, transmit four copies to the appropriate county planning agency; two copies to the State Department of Administration, Office of Land Information Services per the requirements of Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes (unless the subdivider provides written evidence that Chapter 236 does not require such submittal); an adequate number of copies to the city plan commission; and copies to all affected city boards, commissions or departments, and all affected local utility companies for their review and recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. The county planning agency, and all state agencies as authorized under Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes shall be hereinafter referred to as objecting agencies. 
(4)  Time Period for Agency Review. The above agencies, staff, commissions, and consultants shall, within twenty days of the date of receiving their copies of the preliminary plat, notify the subdivider and the city plan commission of any objections or recommendations. If there are no objections by objecting agencies, they shall so certify the face of the copy of the plat and shall return that copy to the city plan commission. If one of these county or state objecting agencies fails to act within twenty days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. 
(5)  Plan Commission Action. The city plan commission, within sixty days of the date of filing of preliminary plat with the secretary of the plan commission, shall approve, approve conditionally or reject such plat. In the case of rejection, the plan commission shall list reasons for rejection. The time period within which plan commission action is required shall not commence until the city has received all maps, plans, drawings, and related data necessary for review of the latest version of the preliminary plat. Failure of the city plan commission to act within sixty days shall constitute approval, except where such timeframe is extended by written agreement of the subdivider. After plan commission action, the plan commission secretary shall return one copy of the plat to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon, along with a letter setting forth the conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection. One copy each of the plat and letter shall be placed in the city plan commission's permanent file. 
(6)  Effect of Preliminary Plat Approval. Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the final plat, except that if the final plat is submitted within twelve months of preliminary plat approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat layout as indicated in Wisconsin Statutes, Section 236.11(1)(b), the final plat shall be entitled to approval with respect to such layout. The preliminary plat shall be deemed an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, which will be subject to further consideration by the city plan commission and city council at the time of its submission. 
(7)  Copies to Utility Providers. The subdivider shall provide, via certified mail, a copy of the approved preliminary plat to all local utility providers (i.e. natural gas, telephone, cable television, telecommunications, and electric company) so that they may identify appropriate locations for facilities and easements. 
(8)  Replats. Replats are to be processed in accordance with the provisions of Section 236.36, Wisconsin Statutes and subsection 18.04.046(c). 
(b)  Preliminary Plat Requirements. The preliminary plat shall be submitted at a scale of not more than one hundred feet to one inch, and shall show correctly on its face the following information. The director of public works may waive one or more of these technical requirements based on a formal written request (including justification) from the subdivider.

(5)  When a dedication of land is required, the city council resolution accepting the dedication and approving the map shall be placed on the face of the map. 
(6)  If the certified survey map contains private roads, the following note shall be added to the certified survey map: 
NOTICE OF POSSIBLE LIMITATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES: 
THIS CERTIFIED SURVEY MAP CONTAINS PRIVATE ROAD(S), AND, AS A RESULT, CERTAIN PUBLIC SERVICES MAY BE LIMITED. THE EXTENT OF THESE LIMITATIONS MAY BE SPELLED OUT IN A DOCUMENT CALLED A CITY/DEVELOPER AGREEMENT OR CONTRACT FOR IMPROVEMENTS; OR, IF THIS IS A CONDOMINIUM PLAT, IN A DOCUMENT CALLED A GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (GDP), WHICH DIRECTLY RELATES TO THIS CSM AND IS FILED AS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT IN THE OFFICES OF BOTH THE WHITEWATER CITY CLERK AND THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS FOR THE CITY OF WHITEWATER. 
(7)  Within the M-1 general manufacturing district, all minor subdivisions must be consistent with a detailed plan showing future street alignments and general lot arrangements for all lands under the control of the subdivider. Such a detailed plan may be a component of the city's comprehensive (master) plan, but in any case shall be subject to plan commission approval before action may be taken on the certified survey map. 
(c)  Reconfigurations and Replats. 
(1)  A certified survey map may be used to change the boundaries of lots and outlots within a recorded plat or certified survey map if the reconfiguration does not result in a major subdivision, affect areas previously dedicated to the public, alter any previous restrictions on the recorded plat or certified survey map, or violate other provisions of this chapter. The subdivider shall proceed with such a reconfiguration under the provisions of Section 18.04.046 of this chapter. Reconfiguration by a certified survey map that crosses the boundary of a recorded plat is permitted under Wisconsin Statutes, Section 236.34(1). The subdivider shall proceed with a reconfiguration that crosses the boundaries of a recorded plat under the procedures specified within Wisconsin Statutes, Section 236.34(1). 
(2)  When it is proposed to replat all or part of a recorded subdivision under the provisions of Wisconsin Statutes, Section 236.36, the subdivider or person wishing to replat shall vacate or alter the recorded plat as provided in Wisconsin Statutes, Sections 236.40 through 236.44. The subdivider or person wishing to replat shall then proceed as specified in this chapter for preliminary and final plats. The plan commission secretary shall schedule a public hearing before the city plan commission when a replat of lands within the city is filed, and shall cause notices of the proposed replat and public hearing to be mailed to the owners of all properties within the limits of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat and to the owners of all properties within two hundred feet of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat. 
(Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.048 - Extraterritorial subdivisions. 
(a)  Extraterritorial Subdivision Policies. The following policies shall govern the city in approving major and minor subdivisions (plats and CSMs) within the extraterritorial jurisdiction in order to protect rural character and farming viability, and to preserve future opportunities for orderly urban development and associated public utility extensions. 
(1)  Within portions of the extraterritorial jurisdiction that are also within the sewer service area, subdivisions shall be permitted where the cumulative development density will not exceed one lot for each thirty-five acres of land owned on January 1, 2001, by the then-current property owner. The city shall determine the land ownership configuration as of January 1, 2001, using the 2001 Land Atlas and Plat Book for the respective county. The city shall determine the parcel acreage as of January 1, 2001, using more detailed records available from the respective county government, if historic records dating back to January 1, 2001, are available. All lots divided from the January 1, 2001, parcel since January 1, 2001, shall be counted against this density standard, except for a lot created to separate the farmstead from the January 1, 2001, parcel. Exceptions to this policy may be granted under one or more of the following circumstances: 
(A)  New lots in excess of one lot per thirty-five acres will result in the filling in of areas surrounded or nearly surrounded by pre-existing subdivisions; 
(B)  The subdivisions is recommended by adopted elements of the city's comprehensive (master) plan for development on private well and septic systems at a density in excess of one lot per thirty-five acres; 
(C)  The subdivision is allowed by intergovernmental agreement of the city and town; 
(D)  The subdivision is consistent with the detailed policies of the Jefferson County Agricultural Preservation and Land Use Plan for lands within the Agricultural Preservation Area, as described in that plan; 
(E)  Conditions allowing for an exception or waiver under the provisions of Section 18.04.010(l) are or will be met. 
(2)  The minimum lot size in the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be one acre. A smaller lot size may be allowed if also approved by the appropriate town board. 
(3)  The city will attempt to seek consistency with locally adopted town plans. To the extent that the adopted plans and policies of the city are more restrictive, the city's policies shall prevail with respect to city review of extraterritorial subdivisions, subject to the limitations in subsection (a)(1) above. 
(4)  All subdivisions within the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be subject to the park land reservation or dedication requirements made applicable to extraterritorial subdivisions under Section 18.04.030(g). 
(5)  Subdivisions within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be required to follow erosion control plans in compliance with this chapter to the extent allowed by law, or town or county ordinances where at least as restrictive as comparable city ordinances. 
(6)  The city council may require placement of covenants or deed restrictions that are deemed necessary and appropriate to protect the purpose and intent of the city's comprehensive (master) plan and ordinances. Any such restrictions shall be placed on the face of the certified survey map or plat, or on surrounding lands from which the lot or lots were created if necessary to verify the density standards established in subsection (a)(1). 
(7)  All subdivisions located within the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be designed to be served by city sanitary sewer and water in the future, with lands within the city's sewer service area subject to the additional requirements prescribed under Section 18.04.070(b). The city shall not extend its sanitary sewer and water facilities to lands located outside of the city's corporate limits. 
(b)  Extraterritorial Subdivision Procedures. Procedural requirements for subdivisions within the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be identical to those required for subdivisions within the corporate limits of the city. In all cases, the time period within which action is required shall not begin until the city has received all maps, drawings and data required for plat or certified survey map approval. All subdivisions within the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall pay city-required review fees contained in this chapter. 
(c)  Extraterritorial Subdivision Requirements. Submittal requirements for subdivisions within the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be identical to those required for subdivisions within the city limits. 
(Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.050 - Subdivision to accommodate a planned community development project. 
(a)  Alternative Procedures for PCDs. A development that is required to comply with this chapter and that is obtaining zoning approval as a planned community development (PCD) or planned community development-traditional neighborhood development (PCD-TND), may receive city subdivision approval as provided in this subsection rather than pursuant to procedures found elsewhere in this chapter. 
(b)  Preliminary Plat not Required. An approved general development plan for a PCD or PCD-TND project substitutes for a preliminary plat that would otherwise be required under Section 18.04.042. 
(c)  Final Plat Required. A final plat or certified survey map shall be required if the project involves creation of a subdivision as defined in this chapter. The final plat or certified survey map shall be reviewed for compliance with the approved general development plan, the approved specific implementation plan, and the standards of this chapter. 
(d)  Waivers. Approval of the specific implementation plan of a PCD or PCD-TND project shall authorize and direct the granting of exceptions and waivers to otherwise applicable standards in this chapter to allow the final plat or certified survey map to implement the approved specific implement plan. 
(Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.060 - Design standards. 
(a)  Street Arrangement. In any new subdivision, the layout of public streets, bikeways, and pedestrian paths shall substantially conform to the arrangement and location indicated on the official map, comprehensive plan or component neighborhood development plan of the city. In areas for which such plans have not been completed, the street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, the topography, such natural features as streams and tree growth, the proposed future land to be served by such streets and the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The functional classification of various types of streets is as follows: 
(1)  Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide for through traffic and ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation areas, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of arterial streets and highways, and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to connect. 
(2)  Collector streets shall be arranged to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to arterial streets and highways. They should also connect to special traffic generators such as schools, churches, and shopping centers and other concentrations of population. 
(3)  Minor streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, discourage use by through traffic, permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(b)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts for off-street loading and service access, unless otherwise required by the city plan commission. Dead-end alleys shall not be approved, and alleys shall not connect to an arterial street. 
(c)  Street Extensions. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the city plan commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. 
(d)  Street Names. Street names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names in the Whitewater zip code, and existing street names shall be projected wherever possible. 
(e)  Arterial Street and Highway Protection. Whenever a proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to an arterial street or highway, the following standards may be applicable: 
(1)  Within areas planned for one and two family residential development, adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line. 
(2)  Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to control access to streets or alleys except where control of such strips is placed with the city under conditions approved by the city plan commission. 
(3)  When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-of-way of an existing or proposed arterial street or highway, a planting strip at least thirty feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to the highway in addition to the normal lot depth. The treatment within this planting strip shall be unified along the entire frontage in accordance with a plan prepared by the subdivider and approved by the city. This strip shall be a part of the platted lots but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs; the modification of plantings and the building of structures not provided for in the approved planting plan are prohibited." 
(4)  Commercial and industrial districts shall have provided, on each side of a limited access arterial street or highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and the arterial street or highway. 
(5)  Streets parallel to a limited access arterial street or highway, when intersecting another arterial street or highway or a collector street which crosses the highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of two hundred feet from the limited access highway right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades be means of appropriate approach gradients. 
(6)  Minor streets immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways shall be avoided in residential areas. 
(f)  Street Dimensional Standards. The minimum right-of-way width, roadway width, sidewalk requirements, and parking requirements for all proposed streets shall be as specified in the following table. If the city's official map or components of the city's comprehensive (master) plan provide for alternative requirements, the director of public may substitute the alternative requirements for those listed in the table below. 
Table 1 
Minimum Street Design Requirements 
Type of Street 	Right-of-way width (feet) 	Pavement width, curb-face to curb face (feet) 	Sidewalks Required? 1 	On-Street Parking Allowed? 
Arterial Street 	100 	52 (60 feet with bike lanes) 	Yes, both sides 	No 
Collector Street 	70 	38 	Yes, both sides 	Yes, without bike lanes; No, with bike lanes 
Minor Street—2 side parking 	66 	38 	Yes, both sides 	Yes, both sides 
Minor Street—1 side parking 	66 2 	32 	Yes, both sides 	Yes, one side 
Minor Street—No parking 	60 	28 	Yes, both sides 	No 
Cul-de-sac 3 	60 	32 	Both sides if over 350 feet; None if under 	Yes, one side 
 
NOTES: 1 	All sidewalks shall be concrete and five feet in width. 
2 	The director of public works may reduce minimum right-of-way width to 60 feet where interference with utilities or snow storage will not result. 
3 	The maximum length of new cul-de-sac streets is 1000 feet. 
 
(1)  Extension of existing streets (that exceed the above standards) shall be developed to conform to the existing street dimension, unless otherwise allowed by the city plan commission. 
(2)  Cross-sections for freeways, expressways and parkways shall be based upon detailed engineering studies. 
(3)  Cul-de-sac streets designated to have one end permanently closed shall not exceed one thousand feet in length. All cul-de-sac streets designated to have one end permanently closed shall terminate in a circular turn around having a minimum right-of-way radius of sixty feet and a minimum outside curb radius of forty feet. All cul-de-sacs shall be designed to accommodate snow storage and removal per the direction of the director of public works. 
(g)  Street Grades. Street grades shall be established to avoid excessive grading, the indiscriminate removal of ground cover and trees, and general leveling of the topography. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length equivalent in feet to fifteen times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade for an arterial street, and one-half this minimum for all other streets. The minimum centerline grade of all streets shall in no case be less than one-half of one percent. Unless necessitated by exceptional topography subject to the approval of the director of public works, the maximum centerline grade of any street or public way shall not exceed the following: 
(1)  Arterial streets, six percent; 
(2)  Collector streets, eight percent; 
(3)  Minor streets, alley and frontage streets, ten percent; 
(4)  Pedestrian ways, twelve percent unless steps of acceptable design are provided. 
(h)  Street Radii of Curvature. When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one point by more than ten degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on said centerline of not less than three hundred feet for arterial and collector streets, and one hundred feet for minor streets. A tangent of at least one hundred feet in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(i)  Half-streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half-street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of half-streets shall be avoided where possible. 
(j)  Street Intersections. 
(1)  Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. 
(2)  Number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two. 
(3)  Number of intersections along arterial streets and highways shall be held to a minimum. The distance between such intersections shall not be less than five hundred feet, as measured from centerline to centerline. 
(4)  Property lines at street intersections shall be cut off by a straight line through two points, with each point being fifteen feet from the point of intersection that would otherwise occur if the property lines were to join at a right angle. 
(5)  Minor streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or collector streets; but if the centerlines of such minor streets approach the major street from opposite sides within three hundred feet of each other measured along the centerline of the arterial or collector street, then the location shall be so adjusted that the adjoinment across the major or collector street is continuous and a jog is avoided. 
(k)  Multiuse Paths and Walkways. The minimum width of a right-of-way or easement for a multiuse path shall be twenty feet, with a minimum pavement width of ten feet. The minimum width of an easement for a pedestrian-only walkway shall be ten feet, with a minimum surface width of five feet. 
(l)  Blocks. The widths, lengths, and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land, zoning requirements, need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic, and the limitations and opportunities of topography: 
(1)  Blocks in residential areas shall not be less than six hundred feet nor more than fifteen hundred feet in length, unless otherwise dictated be exceptional topography or other limiting factors of good design. 
(2)  Pedestrian ways within easements or rights-of-way of not less than ten feet in width may be required near the center and entirely across any block over nine hundred feet in length where deemed essential by the city plan commission to provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access to parks, schools, shopping centers, churches or transportation facilities. 
(3)  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic. Width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and the area zoning restrictions for such use. 
(m)  Lots. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting for the buildings contemplated: 
(1)  Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines on which the lots face. Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary lines and zoning district boundaries rather than cross them. 
(2)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited, except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(3)  Every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at least thirty feet on a public street. 
(4)  Area and dimensions of lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance, and in areas not served by public sewer shall, in addition, conform to the requirements of the State Department of Commerce. Whenever a tract is subdivided into large parcels, such parcels shall be arranged and dimensioned as to allow resubdivisions of any such parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(5)  Lots shall have a minimum average depth of one hundred feet. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of two to one shall be considered a desirable ratio under normal conditions. Depth of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and the area zoning restrictions for such use. 
(6)  Width of lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
(7)  Corner lots shall have an extra width of ten feet beyond zoning ordinance lot width requirements to permit adequate building setbacks from side streets. 
(8)  Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise unplattable lands which lie between a proposed subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream. 
(9)  Flag lots, as defined in Section 18.04.020, shall be prohibited within the city limits and discouraged within the extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
(n)  Utility Easements. The city plan commission may require utility easements of a minimum of ten feet in width where necessary or advisable for electric power and communication wires and conduits; storm and sanitary sewers; and gas, water and other utility lines. Where side or rear lot lines within a subdivision abut one another, the subdivision may provide easements of five feet in width on abutting lot lines to form the ten foot minimum. 
(o)  Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway channel or stream, an adequate drainageway easement or dedication shall be provided. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway easement or dedication shall be subject to the approval of the director of public works. 
(p)  Public Sites and Open Spaces. The provision of public sites and open spaces is as provided for in Section 18.04.030. 
(q)  Floodplains. The subdivision shall meet all flood protection standards in Chapter 19.46 of the City of Whitewater Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 1600 §9, 2006; Ord. 1510 §1(part), 2002).  
18.04.070 - Required improvements. 
(a)  Determination of Adequacy of Public Facilities and Services. 
(1)  A certified survey map, preliminary plat or final plat shall not be approved within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction unless the city plan commission and the city council determine that adequate public facilities and public services are available to meet the needs of the proposed subdivision. 
(2)  The applicant shall furnish any data requested by the director of public works who shall transmit this information to appropriate city commissions, committees, and boards for review and shall act as coordinator for their reports to the city plan commission and the city council on the adequacy of water, sanitary and storm sewers, fire service, police, parks and open space, recreation facilities, and transportation facilities. 
(3)  Public facilities and public services for a proposed subdivision shall be found to be adequate by the city when the following conditions exist: 
(A)  The proposed subdivision is located within the city's sewer service area where main line interceptor sewer service is presently under construction, or designated by the city council for extension. The city plan commission and the city council shall also consider the recommendations of the director of public works on the capacity of trunk lines and of sewerage treatment facilities and any other information presented. 
(B)  The proposed subdivision is located within the city's sewer service area serviced by arterial transmission water main with adequate capacity for the proposed development, or the water distribution system that is needed is under construction or scheduled for construction. The city plan commission and the city council shall consider the recommendations of the director of public works on water line capacities, water sources and storage facilities and any other information presented. 
(C)  The director of public works recommends to the city plan commission and the city council that adequate facilities are available to insure proper stormwater management. 
(D)  The city parks and recreation commission recommends that future residents of the proposed subdivision can be assured park, recreation and open space areas, facilities and services which meet the standards of the city's park and open space plan. 
(E)  The city police and fire departments verify that timely and adequate service can be provided to the future residents and buildings. 
(F)  The proposed subdivision is accessible by existing publicly maintained, all weather roads that are adequate to accommodate both existing traffic and new traffic to be generated by the development on the lands proposed for division, or necessary additional roads and road improvements are budgeted for construction with public or private financing. The city plan commission and city council shall consider recommendations of other consenting agencies and jurisdictions, and such factors as levels of service, average peak use, and any other information presented. 
(4)  Where the city plan commission and the city council determine that one or more public facilities or services are not adequate for the proposed subdivision, but that a portion of the area could be served adequately, or that careful phasing of the development could result in all public services being adequate, conditional approval may include only such portions or may specify phasing of the development. 
(b)  Policies within Sewer Service Area. Except as provided below, all proposed subdivisions within the city's sewer service area, as delineated by the Department of Natural Resources and the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, shall be served by city sanitary sewer and water. No preliminary plat, final plat or certified survey map shall be approved by the city unless the subdivider provides evidence that all proposed parcels within the city sewer service area will be served with city sanitary sewer and water. The may allow the phased provision of city sanitary sewer and water service to newly created parcels within the extraterritorial jurisdiction and the Whitewater sewer service area, provided that a binding agreement for phased utility service is executed among the subdivider, property owner, and city at the time of subdivision approval and made a condition of approval by the city. The agreement and associated utility plans shall demonstrate how and when city sanitary sewer and water service will be provided to the newly created parcels. It shall be a policy of the city to not extend city sewer and water service to properties located outside of the city's corporate limits. 
(c)  Contract for Improvements (Development Agreement). Before the final approval of any plat located within the corporate limits of the city, the subdivider shall install all public improvements as hereinafter provided. If such improvements are not installed at the time that the final plat is submitted for approval and before the recording of any major subdivision located within the corporate limits of the city (and certain minor subdivisions at the discretion of the director of public works) the subdivider shall be required to enter into a contract with the city agreeing to install all required improvements. Governmental units to which these bond and guarantee provisions apply may file in lieu of said contract or installment of guarantee, a letter from officers authorized to act on its behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section. The following shall also be required within or simultaneous to the execution of a contract for improvements: 
(1)  The subdivider shall file with said contract, subject to the approval of the city attorney, a bond, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit, certified check or other security in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent of the cost of improvements required to serve the subdivision, as estimated by the director of public works. 
(2)  All required improvements shall be completed by the subdivider or his contractors not later than eighteen months from the date of city approval of the engineering plans and specifications for the subdivision. 
(3)  As a further guarantee that all obligations for work on improvements are satisfied, the contractor and sub-contractors who are engaged to be in the construction of utilities of street improvements on dedicated street rights-of-way shall be listed as qualified for such work by the director of public works. 
(4)  The contract shall also require the subdivider to pay all outstanding assessments for public improvements previously installed and all area charges for sanitary sewer and water mains, force mains, pumping stations, and regional stormwater facilities previously installed by the city. 
(5)  The contract shall also establish minimum insurance requirements for the subdivider and its subcontractors. 
(d)  Installment by City. In lieu of making the improvements or arrangements called for in this subsection, the subdivider may file with the city a petition requesting that the city construct such improvements and that the total cost of the improvements be assessed against the property included in the petition for such improvements. The city council shall have the option to grant or deny the petition. Such improvements shall be made at the sole expense of the subdivider and shall be those improvements which are required by the city. If the city council grants the petition, the following sections and the statutory rules governing special assessments shall be applicable, and the city and the subdivider shall enter into a contract including the following provisions: 
(1)  A description of the improvements to be installed, the proposed property to be platted, and the terms under which the city will install the improvements. 
(2)  Clear indication that the entire cost of the improvements shall be assessed against the property. 
(3)  As security and part payment for the improvements to be installed by the city, the subdivider shall either deposit with a state or national bank designated by the city, a cash escrow in the amount of one hundred ten percent of the estimated cost of the improvements as reasonably determined by the director of public works or, at the subdivider's option, a five-year letter of credit in the amount of one hundred ten percent of such estimated cost. The acceptable five-year letter of credit shall be issued by one or more state or national banks and be irrevocable and unconditional. If, in fact, the actual bids for the improvement causes the total cost to exceed the estimated figure by more than ten percent, the cash escrow or five-year letter of credit shall be increased accordingly. 
(4)  The total cost of the improvement shall be levied against the property in five equal amount installments. The total cost shall mean the actual construction costs; interest of improvement bonds issued and on assessments that are levied; and all legal, administrative, and engineering fees and expenses. 
(5)  The total costs of the improvements shall remain a lien against the property until paid in full. Ninety days prior to such time as the second half of the fifth annual assessment payment of principal and interest is due, the city may elect to use the funds held in escrow or represented by the letter of credit to pay off, in whole or in part, such principal balance together with accrued interest thereon. All assessments or installments thereof which are not paid by the date specified shall be extended upon the tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property and all proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special assessment, except as otherwise provided by statute. 
(6)  All Wisconsin Statutes governing special assessments shall be applicable to the performance of this contract. 
(7)  Assessments allocated to any lot within the property shall be paid in full by the subdivider or its agent, successor or assigns, before or at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued and the subdivider or its agent will pay the prevailing sewer connection charge and the city water service charge for each lot for which a building permit is issued at the time such permit is issued. All costs and expenses incurred by the city with reference to the proposed plat prior to the approval of the final plat, shall be paid to the city by the subdivider at the time the final plat is approved. Other costs and expenses incurred by subdivider with reference to the platted area prior to the approval of the final plat will be paid directly by the subdivider and will not be included in the assessment to be levied for the improvement to be installed by the city. 
(8)  In the event the assessment for the improvement has not been levied at the time the permit is applied for, or, in lieu thereof, within one hundred twenty days after issuance of the building permit or at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever event first occurs, one and one-half times the estimated pending assessments shall be deposited with the city clerk. This deposit shall not be required in those instances where one and one-half times the estimated pending assessments have been deposited with the lending institution and proof of such deposit is filed with the city clerk. Upon the assessment rolls being adopted, the clerk will apply the correct amount of the assessments to the account of the lot involved and the balance will be refunded as requested by the depositor. 
(9)  The contract shall also provide for dedication of lands or payment of moneys in lieu of land as provided for in Section 18.04.030. 
(10)  The subdivider is entitled to notice and hearing in regard to the proposed special assessment; however, because the subdivider shall be the owner of all of the tract of land described in the agreement, the subdivider shall waive in the agreement the requirement of notice and hearing, pursuant to Section 66.60(18), Wisconsin Statutes and all acts amending said action. 
(11)  Upon the execution of the contract and the granting of the petition for improvement, the city will order the improvement and proceed pursuant to Section 66.60, Wisconsin Statutes. 
(e)  Range of Required Improvements. The following set of improvements shall be constructed within subdivisions, to the specifications provided: 
(1)  Survey Monuments. The subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Section 236.15, Wisconsin Statutes, and as may be required by the director of public works. 
(2)  Street Grading. After the installation of temporary block corner monuments by the subdivider and establishment of street grades by the city council, the subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all streets proposed to be dedicated in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the director of public works. The subdivider shall grade the roadbeds in the street rights-of-way to subgrade. 
(3)  Street Surfacing. After the installation of all utility and stormwater drainage improvements, including necessary lateral connections, the subdivider shall surface all roadways in streets proposed to be dedicated to the widths prescribed by Section 18.04.060(f). The surfacing shall be done in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the director of public works. No breaking of new pavement will be allowed for a period of five years from initial placement, unless approved by the director of public works in an emergency situation. The cost of surfacing in excess of thirty-four feet in pavement width that is not required to serve the needs of the subdivision shall be borne by the city. 
(4)  Curb and Gutter. After the installation of all utility and stormwater drainage improvements including necessary lateral connections, the subdivider shall construct a thirty inch barrier concrete curb and gutter in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the director of public works. This requirement may be waived where a permanent rural section has been approved by the city council. Wherever possible, provisions shall be made at the time of construction for driveway access curb cuts. The breaking of curbs will only be allowed for driveway approaches. The cost of installation of all inside curbs and gutters for continuous dual roadway pavements shall be borne by the city. 
(5)  Sidewalks and Multiuse Paths. Concrete sidewalks, each a minimum of five feet in width, shall be required along both sides of all public streets unless the city plan commission waives the requirement after finding that sidewalks are not necessary (e.g., sidewalks shall be waived along cul-de-sacs less than three hundred fifty feet in length) to provide safe and adequate pedestrian circulation, or that alternative pedestrian ways will better meet pedestrian circulation needs. The construction of all required sidewalks and multiuse paths shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the director of public works. 
(6)  Public Sanitary Sewerage Systems. The subdivider shall construct sanitary sewers in such a manner as to make adequate sanitary sewerage service available to each lot within the subdivision. The size, type, depth, minimum grade, and installation of all sanitary sewers proposed to be constructed shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the director of public works. Proposed sanitary sewer lines shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the director of public works, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. The minimum depth at the boundary lines shall be as proscribed by the director of public works. The subdivider shall install and complete the installation of sewer laterals to the street lot line prior to any paving, curbing or sidewalk construction. The subdivider shall assume the cost of installing all sanitary sewers ten inches in diameter or less in size. If greater then ten inch diameter sewers are required to handle the contemplated sewage flows, the cost of such larger sewers shall be prorated in proportion to the ratio which the total area of the proposed plat is to the total drainage area to be served by such larger sewer and the excess cost either borne by the city or assessed against the total tributary drainage area. 
(7)  Private Sewage Disposal Systems. If public sewer facilities are not available, the subdivider shall make provision for adequate private sewage disposal systems as specified by the city, state, and county. If at the time of final platting, sanitary sewer facilities are not available to the subdivision, but will become available within a period of five years from the date of recording, the subdivider shall install or cause to be installed sanitary sewers and sewer laterals to the street lot line in accordance with this section and shall cap all laterals as may be specified by the director of public works. 
(8)  Stormwater Drainage Facilities. The subdivider shall construct stormwater drainage facilities, which may include curbs and gutters, catch basins and inlets, storm sewers, road ditches, open channels, and detention or retention facilities as may be required by the director of public works. All such facilities are to be of adequate size, grade, depth, and design to properly serve the subdivision and surface water conditions affecting the subdivision and downstream properties at the time of platting, as determined by the director of public works. The subdivider may be required to design such facilities to accommodate additional capacity. In such an event, the excess cost of design, construction, or providing sufficient land area for that additional capacity shall either be borne by the city or assessed against the remainder of the total tributary drainage area. 
(9)  Public Water Supply Facilities. The subdivider shall construct water mains in such a manner as to make adequate water service available to each lot within the subdivision. The size, type, and installation of all public water mains proposed to be constructed shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the director of public works. Proposed water supply lines shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the director of public works, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. If municipal water service is not available, the subdivider shall make provision for adequate private water systems as specified by the city, state, and county. The subdivider shall install and complete the installation of water laterals to the street lot line prior to any paving, curbing or sidewalk construction. The minimum size water service to any lot may be not less than one inch. The subdivider shall assume the cost of installing all water mains eight inches in diameter or less in size. If greater than eight inch diameter water mains are required, the excess cost of such mains over and above the cost of an eight inch main shall be borne by the city. 
(10)  Other Utilities. The subdivider shall cause gas, electrical power, telephone, cable television, and other telecommunications facilities to be installed in such a manner as to make adequate service available to each lot in the subdivision. No such utility service shall be located on overhead poles. All installations must be underground. Plans indicating the proposed location of all utilities required to serve the plat shall be approved by the director of public works. 
(11)  Street Lights. The subdivider shall install street lights along all streets proposed to be dedicated of a design compatible with the neighborhood, the type of development proposed, and city maintenance costs, as approved by the director of public works. Such lights shall be placed at each street intersection and at such interior block spacing as may be required by the director of public works. 
(12)  Street Signs. The city shall install at the intersection of all streets proposed to be dedicated a street name sign of a design specified by the director of public works. The city shall also install regulatory signs along all streets as necessary. The subdivider shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for all costs associated with the purchase and installation of required street signs. 
(13)  Street Trees. The subdivider shall plant at least one tree of a species acceptable to the city forester, of at least one and one-quarter inch in caliper for each thirty (minimum) feet of all streets proposed to be dedicated and all streets abutting the subdivision. The required trees shall be planted in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 12.24, the city's street terrace tree policy, and a street tree planting plan prepared by the subdivider and approved by the city forester, unless a development agreement specifies another arrangement. In lieu of installing street trees, the subdivider and city forester may agree that the city shall install street trees, with the subdivider paying to the city all costs associated with the purchase and installation of the trees, based on a written cost estimate provided by the city forester. 
(14)  Driveways. The subdivider shall install a hard surfaced driveway from all property lines to the pavement edge of adjacent streets where driveways are to be located, and shall otherwise comply with Chapter 12.16, Driveway Construction, of the city's municipal code.

Within this district, a multifamily building with up to sixteen units is a permitted use for new construction. More than sixteen units per building and up to thirty-two units per building may be requested as a conditional use. Among other issues, conditional use permits should consider long term impacts of the proposal on the surrounding area.

Architectural quality shall be subject to the review of the plan and architectural review commission and include consideration of any design and planning criteria as established by the city, for buildings in this zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.22.040 - Lot area. 
The minimum lot area in the R-3A district is shown is as follows: 
A.  Minimum lot area in the R-3A district for one-family and two-family is as follows: 
1. One-family 	6,400 square feet 
2. Two-family 	9,600 square feet 
 
3.  A nonconforming lot for a one-family or two-family that does not meet the minimum lot area above may be considered as a buildable lot if it: 
a.  Meets all other standards including Section 19.60.050. 
b.  Is reviewed and approved by the city plan and architectural review commission. 
B.  Minimum lot area in the R-3A district for multifamily is as follows: 
1.  Multifamily lot size is twelve thousand square feet, there shall be a higher minimum lot requirement for a higher density multifamily residence. 
2.  Minimum lot size for a higher density residence is determined by adding the number of units. The unit square footage requirement is determined by the number of bedrooms per unit. 
Type of Unit 	Square Feet 
Efficiency 	1,600 
One-bedroom 	2,000 
Two-bedroom 	2,400 
Three-bedroom and over 	2,800 plus 240 additional square feet (sq. ft.) for each bedroom over three 
 
EXAMPLE A 
A multifamily of two one-bedroom (2,000 sq ft * 2 = 4,000 sq ft) + two efficiency (1,600 sq ft * 2 = 3200 sq ft) = a total of 7,200 sq ft. Example A does not meet the threshold to be considered as a higher density multifamily residence; therefore, the minimum lot requirement is 15,000 square feet. 
EXAMPLE B 
A multifamily of three five-bedroom (3,280 sq ft * 3 = 9,840 sq ft) + two two-bedroom (2,400 sq ft * 2 = 4,800 sq ft) = a total of 14,640 sq ft. Example B is higher than the minimum threshold of 12,000 square feet; therefore, the minimum square footage is now 14,640 square feet. 
C.  Minimum lot area for group lodging facilities will be set in conditional use review.

Chapter 19.39 - PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
 
19.39.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The planned development (PD) district is established to promote improved environmental design and innovative uses of land in the city. To this intent, this district allows variation in the relationship of uses, structures and open spaces in developments conceived and implemented as cohesive, unified projects. 
B.  The PD district is intended to allow desirable innovative development activities that demonstrate cohesive site planning, higher quality urban design, architectural design, and public places. This district is also intended to facilitate developments which would add substantially to the net economic value of the community (as determined by measuring the expected short-term and long-term costs and revenues). This district is not intended solely to simply circumvent the intent of other zoning districts, or to seek variance from other district regulations, or to avoid practices consistent with the general health and social and economic value of the neighborhood or immediate context. 
C.  New residential development shall follow the occupancy regulations of the underlying zoning district unless expressly modified by the PD district. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.39.020 - Permitted uses. 
In the PD district, any permitted or conditional use in any of the other districts in this title, or mix of uses, may be permitted subject to the criteria listed below. Any plans, uses, or requirements approved by the city as part of a PD general development plan or specific implementation plan shall be construed to be and enforced as part of this title. 
Permitted uses, subject to the criteria listed below, also include large retail and commercial service developments (with eighty thousand square feet or more on the ground floor). All large format retail developments shall address the issues in Chapter 19.485 for large retail and commercial service development standards, and shall include, as part of the PD, specific plans for short-term and long-term redevelopment of the PD if and when the initial retail development should diminish in economic activity and value. Diminishment of economic activity and value shall include: 
a.  Vacancy of twenty-five percent or more of the primary buildings; 
b.  New uses of the primary buildings which result in a significant reduction of property value; and 
c.  New uses which result in a material decrease in use of the buildings by customers and thereby reduce the viability of surrounding economic activities. 
Such plans should be achievable with no significant cost to the city and in a manner that protects the economic value of adjacent development. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.39.030 - Lot, building, yard and parking requirements. 
In the PD district, there shall be no specified lot area, lot width, yard, height, parking or open space requirements. Recommendations to be discussed are defined by Section 19.39.040. Any lot, building, yard, or parking requirements approved by the city as part of a PD general development plan or specific implementation plan shall be construed to be and enforced as part of this title. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.39.040 - Proposed developments—Issues for consideration. 
As a basis for determining the acceptability of applications for rezoning to the PD district, the following criteria shall be considered in the review of the proposed development. These issues are not mandatory guidelines nor requirements, but issues to be discussed and considered by all parties involved in the PD review and approval process and subject to negotiation and variations for each individual proposal and components of proposals: 
A.  Compatibility with vegetation and topography and with the visual character of the surrounding buildings in the neighborhood or district context; 
B.  The value of the proposed project to the community aesthetically and the way in which the buildings blend, harmonize, improve, and/or complement the surrounding neighborhood; 
C.  Impact on traffic or parking with regard to the surrounding area, proposed facilities, the width and location of streets, the appropriateness of paving and lighting relative to proposed uses and the surrounding area, and public safety as determined by the city; 
D.  Impact of the proposed development upon the city's water supply, sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage systems; 
E.  Impact of the proposed development on existing businesses in the immediate area as well as other businesses outside the immediate area that are likely to be impacted by the new development; 
F.  Provisions for the long-term preservation and maintenance of open space; 
G.  Compactness of the development; 
H.  Integration of different uses, including residential, commercial, civic, and open space; the desirable proximity of uses to one another; the degree to which the mix of uses accommodates the needs of a variety of people, ages, and social groups; 
I.  Preservation and/or reuse of existing buildings and buildings with historical or architectural features that enhance the visual character of the community; 
J.  Incorporation of significant environmental features into the design; and 
K.  General consistency with the city of Whitewater's comprehensive (master) plan. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.39.050 - Procedures for rezoning, general development plan (GDP), and specific implementation plan (SIP) approval. 
Step 1: Procedure for Rezoning. 
1.  The procedure for rezoning to the PD district shall be the same as for any other zoning district change (see Chapter 19.69), except that in addition, twenty copies of a general development plan (GDP) shall be submitted to and approved by the city council following a recommendation by the plan commission. The general development plan of the proposed project shall include the following: 
a.  A site inventory and analysis map with topography at two-foot contours to identify site assets, resources, and constraints, including but not limited to floodplains, wetlands, soils with limitations for building development, utility easements, slopes greater than fifteen percent, and existing trees over four inches in diameter; 
b.  A conceptual site plan or neighborhood development plan, at a scale of no less than one inch equals one hundred feet, which indicates proposed building outlines within the context of the surrounding streets and blocks, location of streets, options (if any) for cross-easements, driveways, parking areas (including options, if any, for shared parking), sidewalks and bicycle paths, service access areas for receiving material and trash removal, and other impervious surfaces; 
c.  A utility feasibility analysis, including a map showing the general locations of proposed public utility connections; 
d.  The location of recreational and open space areas reserved or dedicated to the public; 
e.  A conceptual landscape plan showing general locations and types of proposed landscaping, including maintenance of existing vegetation where appropriate; 
f.  A phasing plan, where applicable; 
g.  A conceptual stormwater management plan identifying the proposed patterns of major stormwater run-off, locations of stormwater infiltration areas, and other significant stormwater management features; 
h.  Typical proposed building elevations identifying the architectural style(s) of the development shown in the context of street elevations that depict several of the buildings on each side of the proposed building; 
i.  A written report that provides general information about the site conditions, development objectives, covenants, conservation easements, or agreements that will influence the use and maintenance of the proposed development may be required for larger or more complex projects; 
j.  Any other data required by the plan commission in order to evaluate the development. 
2.  Upon city council approval and adoption of the general development plan and associated zoning change to the PD district, all plans submitted as well as other commitments, conditions of approval, restrictions and other factors pertinent to assuring that the project will be carried out as presented, shall be filed with the zoning administrator and shall be referred to in regard to enforcement or modification of the general development plan. 
3.  If applicant does not submit and have approved at least one specific implementation plan for a planned development within two years of city approval of a rezoning to the planned development district, the previously approved general development plan shall be considered null and void. A new petition and approval process shall be required to obtain approval of the same or a revised general development plan. 
Step 2: Specific Implementation Plan Approval. 
1.  Detailed plans, described below under the specific implementation plan (SIP) submittal requirements, are not required to be submitted at the time the PD zoning is approved; however, the GDP and SIP review process may be combined and made faster by doing so. Before any building permit is issued, the plan commission shall review and approve an SIP. If the approved GDP specified that development of the site would proceed in phases, the plan commission may approve an SIP covering only a portion of the previously approved GDP area. The applicant shall file twenty copies of the SIP with the plan commission. In addition to meeting all application requirements for plan review under Section 19.63.020, the SIP application shall include the following: 
a.  Where a land division or lot consolidation is proposed, a final plat or certified survey map (CSM) of the entire development area included in the SIP, meeting all requirements of Title 18, the city's land division and subdivision regulations; 
b.  For multi-lot PDs, a detailed neighborhood development plan showing the arrangement, design, and uses of different lots, buildings, driveways, parking areas, parks and open spaces, and paths; 
c.  Typical elevations or detailed design standards for single- and two-family residential buildings and detailed elevations of all proposed nonresidential, mixed use, and multifamily residential buildings. Such detailed elevations shall meet the requirements of Section 19.63.020 and identify all wall signs; the percentage of ground floor commercial facade in windows; and the location, height and materials for screening walls and fences, including those proposed to surround outdoor trash and recyclable storage areas, electrical, mechanical and gas metering equipment, and rooftop equipment; where building construction is not imminent, detailed design standards that will apply to all nonresidential buildings may substitute for detailed elevations, if approved by the zoning administrator; 
d.  Signage plans demonstrating a unified or compatible sign design theme for major signage in the PD; 
e.  A detailed stormwater management and erosion control plan; 
f.  Arrangements, bylaws, provisions or covenants which govern the organizational structure, use, architectural standards, maintenance and continued protection of the planned development. 
2.  At a regular meeting, the plan commission shall approve, conditionally approve with changes consistent with the approved general development plan, or reject the SIP. An SIP for a PD development that is consistent with the GDP and meets other applicable ordinance provisions shall be entitled to approval or conditional approval. A final plat or certified survey map associated with the development may also be subject to city council approval under the provisions of Title 18. Upon final approval of the SIP, it shall be filed with the zoning administrator, and shall be referred to in regard to enforcement of modification of the development plans. All covenants, restrictions or contractual agreements with the city shall be recorded with the register of deeds before final issuance of building permits. 
3.  If an applicant does not commence construction within one year after city approval of an SIP for a planned development, or complete construction within two years of approval of the SIP, the previously approved SIP shall be considered null and void; except where the plan commission approves an alternative phasing plan with the SIP. A new petition and approval process shall be required to obtain SIP approval. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.39.060 - Modifications and changes. 
Any subsequent change of use of any parcel of land or addition or modification of any approved development plans should be submitted to the plan commission for approval. Minor changes can be granted by the plan commission. Major changes that involve changes to the general intent of the project as expressed in the approved GDP shall be made by the city council as specified in Chapter 19.69. A conditional use permit will be required if the total building coverage of a new or remodeled single-family detached dwelling, including the garage, exceeds sixty percent of the lot area within a PD district. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.39.070 - Park fees. 
All residential development shall be subject to a park acquisition fee per dwelling unit and a park improvement fee per dwelling unit, payable before a building permit is issued. The fee will be recommended by the parks and recreation board and then approved by the common council. The fee will be on record at the city clerk's office. The amount of these fees may be reduced by any fee amount previously paid or credited at the time of subdivision, or by fifty percent if the new housing units are created as a result of the conversion or remodeling of a preexisting building. The park acquisition fee may also be reduced if sufficient land area was provided for park purposes at the time of subdivision, based on the calculations in Section 18.04.030(a)(1) of the Whitewater Municipal Code. The fee amounts shall be set by the city council.

Chapter 19.46 - FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS 
 
19.46.010 - Statutory authorization, finding of fact, statement of purpose, title and general provisions. 
A.  Statutory Authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wisconsin Statutes 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in 87.30. 
B.  Finding of Fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
1.  Protect life, health and property; 
2.  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
4.  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
6.  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
7.  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
8.  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
9.  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
D.  Title. This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Whitewater, Wisconsin. 
E.  General Provisions. 
1.  Areas to be Regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. 
a.  Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-zones on the flood insurance rate map. 
2.  Official Maps and Revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the city of Whitewater Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the flood insurance study (FIS) or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file with the city of Whitewater. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
Official maps: Based on the FIS. 
a.  For Jefferson County Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), panel numbers 55055C0432F, 55055C0434F, 55055C0451F, 55055C0452F, 55055C0453F, 55055C0454F with corresponding profiles based on Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated 2-4-15 volume numbers 55055CV001B and 55055CV002B; updated maps with revised panel numbers may be available. 
b.  For Walworth County Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), panel numbers 55127C0009E, 55127C0017E, 55127C0028E and 55127C0029E dated 09/03/2014; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated 09/03/14, Volume No. 55127CV000B; updated maps with revised panel numbers may be available. 
3.  Establishment of Districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
a.  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
b.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
c.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
d.  The flood storage district (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
4.  Locating Floodplain Boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsections a. or b. below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Section 19.46.080. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Section 19.46.070C.3. and the criteria in a. and b. below. 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the the city of Whitewater. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to Section 19.46.080A.6. 
5.  Removal of Lands from Floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Section 19.46.080. 
a.  Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC). 
6.  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
7.  Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wisconsin Statute 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (Wis DOT) is exempt when Wisconsin Statute 30.2022 applies. 
8.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. 
a.  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wisconsin Statutes 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; 62.23 for cities; or 61.35 for villages; or 87.30 which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions but not otherwise. 
b.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
9.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
10.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter. 
11.  Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
12.  Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages. The Walworth and Jefferson County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
13.  General Development Standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a floodprone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)

19.46.050 - Other floodplain districts. 
Other floodplain districts may be established under the ordinance and reflected on the floodplain zoning map. These districts may include general floodplain districts and flood storage districts. 
A.  General floodplain district (GFP). 
1.  Applicability. The provisions for this district shall apply to all floodplains for which flood profiles are not available or where flood profiles are available but floodways have not been delineated. Floodway and floodfringe districts shall be delineated when adequate data is available. 
2.  Permitted Uses. Pursuant to Section 19.46.050A.4., it shall be determined whether the proposed use is located within a floodway or floodfringe area. Those uses permitted in floodway (Section 19.46.030B.) and floodfringe areas (Section 19.46.040B.) are allowed within the general floodplain district, according to the standards of Section 19.46.050C., provided that all permits or certificates required under Section 19.46.070A. have been issued. 
3.  Standards for Development in the General Floodplain District. Section 19.46.030 applies to floodway areas, Section 19.46.040 applies to floodfringe areas. The rest of this chapter applies to either district. 
4.  Determining Floodway and Floodfringe Limits. Upon receiving an application for development within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator shall: 
a.  Require the applicant to submit two copies of an aerial photograph or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to the general floodplain district limits, stream channel, and existing floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and floodproofing measures; 
b.  Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information deemed necessary by the department to evaluate the effects of the proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation and to determine floodway boundaries: 
i.  A typical valley cross-section showing the stream channel, the floodplain adjoining each side of the channel, the cross-sectional area to be occupied by the proposed development, and all historic high water information; 
ii.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information; 
iii.  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream; 
iv.  Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage, water supply and sanitary facilities. 
c.  Transmit one copy of the information described in subsections a. and b. to the department regional office along with a written request for technical assistance to establish regional flood elevations and, where applicable, floodway data. Where the provisions of Section 19.46.070A.2.c. apply, the applicant shall provide all required information and computations to delineate floodway boundaries and the effects of the project on flood elevations. 
B.  Flood Storage District. The flood storage district delineates that portion of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher flood elevations. 
1.  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the flood storage district (FSD), as shown on the official floodplain zoning maps. 
2.  Permitted Uses. Any use or development which occurs in a flood storage district must meet the applicable requirements in Section 19.46.040C. 
3.  Standards for Development in Flood Storage Districts. 
a.  Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal or greater than 0.01 of a foot in the height of the regional flood. 
b.  No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the pre-development ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage. 
c.  If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage district - on this waterway - is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplain storage, as per Section 19.46.080A. of this chapter. 
d.  No area may be removed from the flood storage district unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.46.060 - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  General. 
1.  Applicability. If these standards conform with Wisconsin Statute 59.69(10) for counties or Wisconsin Statute 62.23(7)(h) for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this chapter or any amendment thereto. 
2.  The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue subject to the following conditions: 
a.  No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered an extension, modification or addition; these include painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Ordinary maintenance repairs do not include any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure. 
b.  The construction of a deck that does not exceed two hundred square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure. 
c.  If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for twelve consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter; 
d.  The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent; 
e.  No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed fifty percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with Section 19.46.040C.1. The costs of elevating a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the fifty percent provisions of this subsection; 
i.  Except as provided in subsection ii., if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds fifty percent of the structure's present equalized assessed value. 
ii.  For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building may be permitted in order to restore it after the nonflood disaster, provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of the minimum requirements under applicable FEMA regulations (44 CFR Part 60), or the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
f.  A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, the alteration will comply with Section 19.46.030C.1., flood resistant materials are used, and construction practices and floodproofing methods that comply with Section 19.46.070E. are used. 
B.  Floodway Areas. 
1.  No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use in a floodway area, unless such modification or addition: 
a.  Has been granted a permit or variance which meets all ordinance requirements; 
b.  Meets the requirements of Section 19.46.060A.; 
c.  Will not increase the obstruction to flood flows or regional flood height; 
d.  Any addition to the existing structure shall be floodproofed, pursuant to Section 19.46.070E., by means other than the use of fill, to the flood protection elevation; 
e.  If any part of the foundation below the flood protection elevation is enclosed, the following standards shall apply: 
i.  The enclosed area shall be designed by a registered architect or engineer to allow for the efficient entry and exit of flood waters without human intervention. A minimum of two openings must be provided with a minimum net area of at least one square inch for every one square foot of the enclosed area. The lowest part of the opening can be no more than twelve inches above the adjacent grade; 
ii.  The parts of the foundation located below the flood protection elevation must be constructed of flood-resistant materials; 
iii.  Mechanical and utility equipment must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the flood protection elevation; and 
iv.  The use must be limited to parking or limited storage. 
2.  No new on-site sewage disposal system, or addition to an existing on-site sewage disposal system, except where an addition has been ordered by a government agency to correct a hazard to public health, shall be allowed in a floodway area. Any replacement, repair or maintenance of an existing on-site sewage disposal system in a floodway area shall meet the applicable requirements of all municipal ordinances and ch. COMM 83, Wis. Adm.

Any replacement, repair or maintenance of an existing well in a floodway area shall meet the applicable requirements of all municipal ordinances and chs. NR 811 and NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code. 
C.  Floodfringe Areas. 
1.  No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use unless such modification or addition has been granted a permit or variance by the municipality, and the modification or addition shall be placed on fill or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in compliance with the standards for that particular use in Sections 19.46.040C. and 19.46.070E., except where Section 19.46.060C.2. is applicable. 
2.  Where compliance with the provisions of subsection 1., above, would result in unnecessary hardship and only where the structure will not be used for human habitation or be associated with a high flood damage potential, the board of adjustment/appeals, using the procedures established in Section 19.46.070C., may grant a variance from those provisions of subsection 1., above, for modifications or additions, using the criteria listed below. Modifications or additions which are protected to elevations lower than the flood protection elevation may be permitted if: 
a.  No floor is allowed below the regional flood elevation for residential or commercial structures; 
b.  Human lives are not endangered; 
c.  Public facilities, such as water or sewer, will not be installed; 
d.  Flood depths will not exceed two feet; 
e.  Flood velocities will not exceed two feet per second; and

Subsequent individual land uses following initial approval of the development allowed only by conditional use permit in the zoning district or approved PD specific implementation plan may be allowed only under a subsequent conditional use permit for the specific use, regardless of whether said use entails modifications to the building and/or site layout. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.485.040 - Regulations. 
In addition to applicable zoning district standards and other applicable standards of this title, each large retail and commercial service development shall meet the following additional standards, as may be applicable given the size of each such development: 
A.  Traffic Impact Analysis. A traffic impact analysis is required when a development reaches or exceeds the defined threshold for such an analysis outlined in Figure 19.485(2) [sic], and may be required by the city director of public works for projects below that threshold if there is initial evidence to suggest that existing roads in the area may not be adequate to accommodate additional traffic demands. 
The traffic impact analysis shall be completed in accordance with standards approved by the city director of public works, or where he/she does not approve a particular standard, with the most current revision of the Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines published by the state of Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Where the traffic impact analysis indicates that the proposed development may cause off-site public roads, intersections, or interchanges to function below level of service (LOS) D, then the city may deny the application, may require a size reduction in the proposed development, and/or may require the developer to construct and/or pay for required off-site improvements to achieve LOS D for a planning horizon of a minimum of ten years following full build-out of the development. All such developments shall have direct access to an arterial or collector street. Vehicle access shall be designed to accommodate peak on-site traffic volumes without disrupting traffic on public streets or impairing pedestrian safety. This shall be accomplished through adequate parking lot design and capacity; access drive entry throat length, width, design, location, and number; traffic control devices; and/or sidewalks. The site design shall provide direct transportation connections to adjacent land uses and sites if required by the city. 
B.  Economic and Fiscal Impact Analysis. An economic and fiscal impact analysis is required in accordance with the data requirements established by the city. In addition: 
1.  The analysis shall identify and assess the economic and fiscal impacts on the city. 
2.  The analysis shall propose measures to mitigate adverse impacts and/or maximize positive impacts, including provision of infrastructure or public service improvements sufficient to support the development. Any adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated shall be identified. Mitigation measures to be implemented by the applicant shall be identified. 
3.  If required by the zoning administrator, the applicant shall provide the necessary funding to the city to hire a consultant of the city's choice, with appropriate experience to complete and present an objective economic and fiscal impact analysis to the city. 
C.  Detailed Neighborhood Plan. A detailed neighborhood plan is required in accordance with requirements established by the city. Such neighborhood plan shall cover any undeveloped areas within a one-thousand-five-hundred-foot distance from the boundaries of the development site (except where a lesser distance is approved by the zoning administrator). The detailed neighborhood plan must be completed by the city or applicant prior to the application for conditional use permit or rezoning, and submitted or referenced with such application. The detailed neighborhood plan shall include a map of sufficient detail to establish the potential future mix and development of land uses based on the city's comprehensive plan and the relationship of surrounding lands to the large retail and commercial service development with regard to provision of streets, driveways, bicycle/pedestrian routes, utilities, stormwater management, landscape transitions, setbacks, and community design and character, and general layout, all in a manner that is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan. 
D.  Facilities and Associated Features. The following requirements are applicable when a large retail and commercial service development reaches or exceeds the defined threshold for such facilities and associated features outlined in Figure 19.485(2) [sic]: 
1.  Building Location. Wherever practical, as determined by the plan and architectural review commission based on the particular setting, the primary building within the development shall be located close to the public street, including parking to the side or rear of that building. Where such primary building is proposed to be distant from the public street, the commission may require that the overall development design include smaller buildings on pads or outlots closer to the street. All buildings on outlots shall have an orientation and architectural quality that relates to the primary building. Placement and orientation of all buildings must facilitate appropriate land use transitions and appropriate traffic flow to adjoining roads and to neighboring commercial areas, commercial sites, and neighborhoods, and must forward community character objectives described in the city's comprehensive plan. Also see Section 19.485.040E.7. below for requirements associated with the location of parking lots. 
2.  Building Materials. Exterior building materials shall be of comparable aesthetic quality on all sides. Building materials such as glass, brick, stone, tinted and decorative concrete block are preferred, with wood, stucco, and exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS) also permitted, as determined appropriate by the plan and architectural review commission. Decorative architectural metal with concealed fasteners or decorative tilt-up concrete panels may be approved only if integral to the overall design of the building. Windows shall be prominently incorporated into the building design for both aesthetic and daylighting effect. 
3.  Building Design. The building exterior shall complement other buildings in the vicinity (except those buildings identified for redevelopment), and shall meet the following: 
a.  The building shall employ varying facade setbacks, heights, roof treatments, doorways, window openings, and other structural or decorative elements appropriate to the size and scale of the building and to add architectural interest. 
b.  Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have some combination of features (such as display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features) that are oriented to pedestrians and create a smaller scale, street-friendly character. 
c.  The integration of windows into building design is required. Windows shall be transparent glass wherever the plan and architectural review commission determines it practical. The use of blinds, or display windows shall be acceptable where there is a determination that opacity is required. Backlighting of such windows may be required in such instances. 
4.  Building Entrances. Public building entrances shall be clearly defined and highly visible on the building's exterior design, and shall be emphasized by, and be the focal point for, on-site traffic flow patterns. Two or more of the following design features shall be incorporated into all public building entrances: canopies or porticos, overhangs, projections, arcades, peaked roof forms, arches, or outdoor patios. 
5.  Screening. 
a.  All ground-mounted and wall-mounted mechanical equipment, refuse containers and any permitted outdoor storage shall be fully concealed from on-site and off-site ground-level views, with materials identical to those used on the building exterior facades. 
b.  All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened by parapets, upper stories, and/or strategic placement relative to exterior walls or roofs, so as to not be visible from public streets adjacent or within one thousand feet of the subject property. 
c.  Loading docks shall be completely screened from surrounding public streets and properties. Said screening may be accomplished through loading areas internal to buildings, screen walls which match the building exterior in materials and design, fully opaque landscaping at time of planting, or combinations. 
d.  Gates and fencing may be used for security and access, but not for screening, and they shall be of high aesthetic quality. Decorative metal picket fencing and screening is acceptable. Chain link, wire mesh, or wood fencing is unacceptable, except that decorative, heavy-duty wood gates may be used. 
6.  Parking.

This section shall be known, cited and referred to as the "wellhead protection ordinance" (hereinafter "WHP ordinance"). 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.49.020 - Purpose and authority. 
A.  The residents of the city of Whitewater (hereinafter "the city") depend exclusively on groundwater for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose of the WHP ordinance codified in this chapter is to protect the city's municipal water supply and areas from which city wells draw water, and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city. 
B.  These regulations are established pursuant to the authority granted by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act 410 (effective May 11, 1984), which specifically added groundwater protection to the statutory authorization for municipal planning and zoning in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Areas appropriate for protection in the WHP are established in the wellhead protection plan ("the plan") for city of Whitewater, Wisconsin, dated September 1996 and prepared by Strand Associates, Inc. The plan document is incorporated herein by this reference, and a copy is on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.49.030 - Applicability. 
The regulations specified in the WHP ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply only to lands within those portions of the five-year time of travel zones (hereinafter sometimes "TOT") of Well No. 9 shown on the wellhead protection map (see Exhibit A in Appendix D of WHP) (hereinafter "the map"), which areas also lie within the city corporate limits. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.49.040 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
1.  "Aquifer" means a saturated, permeable geologic formation that contains and will yield significant quantities of water. 
2.  "Cone of depression" means the area around a well, in which the water level has been lowered at least one-tenth of a foot by pumping of the well. 
3.  "Existing facilities which may cause or threaten to cause environmental pollution" means existing facilities which may cause or threaten to cause environmental pollution within the corporate limits of the city's Well No. 9 recharge area which include but are not limited to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' draft list of "Inventory of Sites or Facilities Which may Cause or Threaten to Cause Environmental Pollution," and Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relation's list of "Leaking Underground Storage Tanks" (hereinafter "LUSTs") and the Registry of Waste Disposal Sites in Wisconsin, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, together with future amendments thereto, as if fully set forth. 
4.  "Five-year time of travel (TOT)" The five-year TOT is a portion of the recharge area, the outer boundary of which it is determined or estimated that groundwater and potential contaminants will take five years to reach a pumping well. The five-year TOT for the city's municipal Well No. 9 is established based on the uniform flow equation. The TOT area is shown on the map. The TOT area shown on the map is hereinafter referred to as "the TOT." 
5.  "Groundwater divide" means ridge in the water table, or potentiometric surface, from which groundwater moves away at right angles in both directions. Line of highest hydraulic head in the water table or potentiometric surface. 
6.  "Groundwater protection overlay district" shall be defined as that area within the TOT shown on the map attached as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.

Chapter 19.52 - ACCESS STANDARD REGULATIONS 
Sections: 
 
19.52.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide vehicular access to land development in a manner that preserves the safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Access management encompasses the careful planning of the location, design and operation of driveways, median openings, interchanges, and street connections. If access systems are not properly designed, the primary transportation network, including arterials and highways, will be unable to accommodate the access needs of development and retain their primary transportation function. 
This chapter is intended to promote safe and efficient travel within the city of Whitewater, WI, by limiting the number of conflict points, providing safe spacing standards between driveways, encouraging shared access between abutting properties, and ensuring safe access by emergency vehicles. 
(Ord. No. 1929A, § 1, 10-4-2016)  
19.52.020 - Authority. 
These regulations are adopted under the authority granted by Wisconsin Constitution Article XI, Section 3, and Wisconsin Statutes 62.23 and 66.0101 and amendments thereto. 
(Ord. No. 1929A, § 1, 10-4-2016)  
19.52.030 - Definitions. 
"Arterial road" or "arterial street" means a high-capacity urban road. The primary function of an arterial road is to deliver traffic from collector roads to freeways and between urban centers (see Section 18.04.06 for design standards). 
"Frontage street" means a minor street auxiliary to and located on the side of an arterial street for control of access and for service to the abutting development (see Section 18.04.06 for design standards). 
"Major collector (street)" is longer in length, have lower connective driveway densities, are spaced at greater intervals, have higher annual average traffic volumes, and may have more travel lanes than their minor collectors (see Section 18.04.06 for design standards). 
"Minor collector (street)" is low- to moderate-capacity roads which serve to move traffic from residential areas to major collectors (see Section 18.04.06 for design standards). 
"Local streets" or "residential streets": Local streets comprise all facilities not on one of the higher systems. They serve primarily to provide direct access to abutting land and access to the higher order systems. Local streets offer the lowest level of mobility, and service to through-traffic movement on this system is usually discouraged. (see Section 18.04.06 for design standards). 
"State roads" fall under the jurisdiction of the Wisconsin D.O.T. (see Section 19.51.190). 
"U.S. highway" fall under the jurisdiction of the Wisconsin D.O.T. (see Section 19.51.190). 
(Ord. No. 1929A, § 1, 10-4-2016)  
19.52.040 - Applicability.

(Ord. No. 1929A, § 1, 10-4-2016)  
19.52.060 - Standards. 
(a)  Number of Access Points. 
(1)  Each lot shall have not more than two access points on any street frontage adjacent to any lot. More than two access points shall require a conditional use permit. 
(2)  No lot shall be permitted more than one access point on any one street if its frontage on said street is less than one hundred linear feet (as measured along the right-of-way line). 
(3)  On arterial streets, and in areas experiencing, or expected to experience, congestion and/or safety problems, access to a lot may be required to be located via an access point located on an adjacent property or another street frontage. 
(4)  For residential uses, two access points serving the same street frontage may be approved as a conditional use. 
(5)  If the city anticipates that a property may be subdivided and that the subdivision may result in an unacceptable number or arrangement of driveways, or both, the municipality shall require the property owner to enter into an access covenant to restrict future access. 
(6)  The city shall restrict access to right-turn-only ingress and egress or to another state-maintained road or local road if safe and efficient movements cannot be accommodated. 
(b)  Residential Uses. Residential uses shall not have access points onto a nonresidential collector or arterial street unless such street has the only available frontage. 
(c)  Nonresidential Uses. Nonresidential uses shall not have access points onto a residential street unless such street has the only available frontage. A second access point may be granted by a conditional use permit. 
(d)  Access Near Street Intersections. At its intersection with the street right-of-way line on an arterial or nonresidential collector street, no access point shall be located closer than one hundred feet from the intersection of any two street rights-of-way unless such street is the only available frontage on the subject property. Nonconforming driveways may be replaced in their current location. 
(e)  Distance Between Access Drives. The minimum distance between access drives serving the same property shall be twenty-five feet (edge to edge), as measured at the property line. A distance in excess of twenty-five feet may be required if existing or projected traffic warrant a greater distance.

(i)  Traffic Control. The traffic generated by any use shall be channelized and controlled in a manner which avoids congestion on public streets and other safety hazards. Traffic into and out of all off-street parking, loading, and traffic circulation areas serving six or more parking spaces shall be forward moving, with no backing into streets or pedestrian ways. Traffic control devices shall be required as determined by the city of Whitewater. 
(j)  Depiction on Required Site Plan. Any and all proposed access drives on the subject property shall be depicted as to their location and configuration on the site plan required for the development of the subject property. Site plan requirements can be found under Chapter 19.63 Plan Review. 
(k)  Paving of Access. All access approach areas located within a street right-of-way shall be paved to the satisfaction of the neighborhood services department with a hard, all-weather surface, and shall be maintained so as to prevent the transport of gravel, dirt, or other eroded material from the subject property into the right-of-way. This requirement must be fulfilled before building occupancy, unless granted a time-specific extension in writing by the neighborhood services department. Requirements for the paving can be found in Chapter 19.51.

19.54.020 - Definitions and regulations specific to certain signs. 
The following definitions shall be used by this chapter to assist in the establishment of clear cut signage regulations. In general, "sign purposes" refers to where or how a sign is used; "sign configurations" refers to the style of the sign; and "sign measurement" explains how the dimensions of a sign are determined. 
A.  "Sign" means any object, device, display, structure, or part thereof, situated outdoors, which is used to advertise, identify, display, direct or attract attention to an object, person, institution, organization, business, product, service, event, or location by any means, including figures, letters, designs, symbols, fixtures, colors, illumination, or projected images. Signs do not include the flag or emblem of any nation, organization of nations, state, city, religious, fraternal or civic organization; also merchandise and pictures or models of products or services incorporated in a window display, works of art which in no way identify a product, or scoreboards located on athletic fields. Definitions of particular functional, locational and structural types of signs are listed in this section. (Traffic control and other public agency signs located within a right-of-way are not included within this definition and are not regulated by the provisions of this chapter.) 
B.  Sign Purposes. 
1.  "Advertising sign" means a sign which directs attention to a business, commodity, service, or entertainment conducted, sold, or offered elsewhere than upon the premises where the sign is displayed. Advertising signs include billboards. (Refer to Section 19.54.030.) 
2.  "Auxiliary sign" means a sign which provides special information such as price, hours of operation, or warning and which does not include brand names, or information regarding product lines or services. It may contain a business logo if the logo is under one square foot in area.

4.  "Community information sign" means an officially-designated sign which is limited to either the display of information of interest to the general community regarding scheduled public events and information of general interest to the residents of Whitewater, or signage located on scoreboards, fences or similar structures within the confines of publicly owned (city, school district, university) athletic fields, courts, rinks or other active recreation facilities as approved by the parks and recreation board.

b.  Such sign shall only display information regarding events and information of general interest to the residents of Whitewater. Copy which may be considered as advertising a product, private or restricted participation event, or activity for private profit shall be prohibited. This provision may be waived by conditional use for community information signs on lands owned by the public for recreational purposes, provided that the installation of the sign provides a benefit to a public or community organization. 
c.  Such sign may be located on private or public property. 
d.  Such sign shall conform to the visibility requirements of Chapter 19.51 and Illustration 2. 
e.  Maximum sign area shall be thirty-two square feet, unless a larger sign is approved by the plan commission based on conditions unique to the placement of the sign or the required length of the message. Such sign shall not be counted as adding to the area of signage on the subject property for the purposes of regulating sign area per Section 19.54.050F. 
5.  Canopy and Awning Signs. The use of canopy and awning signs reduces the maximum number of wall sign by one. Canopy and awning signs are subject to the following provisions: 
a.  Surface Area: The sign surface area of a canopy or awning script/logo height shall be limited to twelve inches, except a greater script/logo height may be approved by conditional use. 
Illustrations A 
 
b.  Location: 
1.  Canopies and awnings shall be constructed and erected so that the lowest portion of the projecting frame thereof shall be not less than eight feet above the level of the sidewalk or public thoroughfare. Anything under eight feet shall require a conditional use permit. 
2.  No portion of the canopy or awning sign shall extend above or beyond the canopy or awning upon which it is attached. However, a sign may be hung beneath a canopy parallel to the building frontage so long as it and its structural components are no less than eight feet above the ground immediately beneath the sign. Anything under eight feet shall require a conditional use permit. 
c.  Materials: Canopy and awning signs shall be made of either the material with which the canopy or awning is covered or other water proof materials affixed flush to the face of the canopy or awning, or be painted directly on the awning or canopy material with weather-resistant paint. 
6.  Directional Sign, Off-Premises. "Off-premises directional sign" means a sign which indicates only the name, direction, and/or distance of a business or activity. It may contain a business logo if the logo is under one square foot in area and approval only by conditional use. (Refer to Section 19.54.030.) 
Illustration B 
 
7.  "On-premises directional sign" means an information sign which has a purpose secondary to the use of the lot upon which it is located, including signs that indicate parking availability, entrances, particular buildings within a multi-building development, hours of operation, available merchandise in a drive-through lane, and wall-mounted posters indicating particular movies in a theater. 
a.  Freestanding on-premises: no freestanding on-premises directional sign shall be greater than nine square feet in area.

8.  "Sandwich board/pedestal sign" means a movable sign placed by hand outside the building while the business is open; removed at the time the business closes each day; self-supporting and stable even on windy days because of its design; used for the purpose of promoting special business offers and not as primary business signage; and meeting all applicable size, placement, and other requirements of this chapter (see Section 19.54.050K. in particular). 
9.  "Group sign" means a sign displaying the collective name of a group of uses such as the title of a shopping center, office park, industrial park and/or their tenants or occupants. No sales or price information shall be permitted. Portions of the sign containing names of individual tenants shall be considered as part of the area of a group sign. Group signs shall only be permitted within developments serving two or more nonresidential tenants in spaces with separate outside customer doors, and shall limit information to the name of the development and/or its occupants. Group signs serving two or more occupants not located on the same lot, but within the same multi-building development, shall be located on one of the lots being served by the sign. Such signs shall not be considered an advertising sign as defined in this section. (Refer to Section 19.54.052-Table B for size and locational information.) 
10.  "Identification sign" means a sign indicating the name and/or address of the tenant of the residential unit or manager of the property located upon the residential premises where the sign is displayed. Such sign shall not exceed the allowed area:

In such cases, the average elevation of the base of such berm or other area shall be considered as the ground level. 
2.  Sign area shall be measured in the following manner: 
a.  In the case of a sign placed within a frame, or other structure, sign area consists of the entire surface area of the sign on which copy could be placed. The supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall not be counted as a part of the sign face area unless such structure or bracing is made a part of the sign's message. Where a sign has two or more display faces, the combined total area of all faces shall be considered the sign face area. 
b.  In the case of a sign whose message is fabricated together with the background which borders or frames that message, sign face area shall be the total area of the entire background. 
c.  In the case of a sign whose message is applied to a background which provides no border or frame, sign face area shall be the area of the smallest rectangle which can encompass all words, letters, figures, emblems, and other elements of the sign message. 
d.  Signs less than one square foot in area are not regulated by this chapter. 
e.  The following illustrations demonstrate how sign face area shall be determined:

(Ord. No. 1924A, § 1(XXIII), 7-19-2016; Ord. No. 1940A, § 1, 6-20-2017)  
19.54.030 - General signage regulations. 
The regulations contained in this section apply to signs in all districts. 
A.  Sign Prohibitions and Limitations. 
1.  No sign shall use any word, phrase, symbol, shape, form or character in such manner as to interfere with moving traffic, including signs which incorporate typical street-type and/or traffic control-type signage designs and colors. 
2.  No fluttering, undulating, swinging, rotating or otherwise moving signs, pennants or other decoration shall be permitted except for electronic message center signs and time and/or temperature signs in nonresidential zoning districts. 
3.  No illuminated flashing signs shall be permitted. Electronic message center signs meeting the definition and requirements of this chapter shall not be considered illuminated flashing signs. 
4.  No illuminated sign shall be permitted unless the illumination is so designed that the lighting level does not affect adjacent property, pursuant to the standards in Section 19.57.150 (outdoor lighting standards). All illuminated signs shall comply with the state electrical code and Section 19.54.070B, and illumination shall be limited to one hour before the daily opening of the associated business and one hour after the daily closing of the associated business. 
5.  No mobile/portable signs or banners shall be permitted unless approved by the zoning administrator. Sign use and other regulations shall be as specified in Section 19.54.020D.2. 
6.  No off-premises directional signs shall be permitted for non-governmental or non-institutional uses or for any use outside of a public right-of-way; however, such signs, as well as city entrance signs, may be permitted within a public right-of-way, per subsection 19.54.030C. of this section, for government facilities, nonprofit, non-religious community gathering spots, major economic centers such as the downtown and business park, and schools. 
7.  No advertising signs shall be permitted, except for certain community information signs as described in Sections 19.54.010B. and 19.54.020C.4. 
Rationale. The adoption of subsection A.7. of this section reflects a formal finding of fact on the part of the city plan commission and city council that the prohibition of advertising signage furthers two compelling government interests: 
a.  The general public interest of reducing visual clutter caused by advertising signage which the city has determined is a significant cause of unsafe traffic conditions; and 
b.  The public interest served by furthering the implementation of the purposes of this chapter and the city comprehensive plan in terms of limiting the further spread of strip commercial development, of which advertising signs are a primary contributor. Furthermore, the city advocates this regulation leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech communication for the messages portrayable on such advertising signs; namely, distributed print media, broadcast media, and point-of-purchase display, and is narrowly defined so as to limit the prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage. 
B.  Sign Location Requirements. 
1.  No sign shall be erected or maintained at any location where by reason of its position, wording, illumination, size, shape, or color it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or be confused with, any authorized traffic control sign, signal or device. 
2.  No sign shall be located within a required buffer yard or within a permanently protected green space area (see Chapter 19.57), unless approved by the city. 
3.  No sign shall be mounted on a roof. 
4.  No sign, temporary or otherwise, shall be affixed to a tree or utility pole. 
5.  Pylon signs other than arm/post are not permitted in any residential district. 
C.  Private signs extending into the public right-of-way. 
1.  Any person desiring to place any private sign such that it will extend over or onto the public right-of-way shall first obtain a sign permit. In the granting of such a permit, the city may require the applicant to provide and maintain public liability insurance on the installation in an amount not less than $50,000.00 protecting the city as its interests may appear as the result of any accident or injury for which it might become in any manner liable. In the event such insurance should be terminated for any reason, or the holder of any permit should fail to keep such insurance in force at any time, then the permit for the maintenance of such private sign shall be forthwith removed, or if not removed by the holder of the permit, then such private sign shall be removed or caused to be removed by the zoning administrator and the expense thereof shall be recovered from the holder of the permit. 
2.  There is hereby established along each side of every public street, public alley, or public highway a fictional line five feet distant and outward from the lot line and parallel with such street, alley, or public highway. No sign which, exclusive of supports, exceeds two hundred fifty pounds in weight or has an area greater than forty square feet shall be permitted to extend into the highway or over the highway or sidewalk area beyond such fictional line, except only where such private sign is to be placed over a substantial canopy or portico of such nature that the same will afford ample protection to the public from any possible injury from such private sign. 
3.  In no event shall any sign regardless of size or weight extend into the public street, highway, or sidewalk area further than to within three feet from the face of the curb or curb line as determined by the zoning administrator or be placed less than eight and one-half feet above the sidewalk or sidewalk grade. 
4.  Except for sandwich board/pedestal signs, all private signs extending on or over public rights-of-way shall be adequately supported from buildings, posts, or other permanent supports located on private property. In no case shall sign posts or other permanent supports be permitted within the limits of a public street, alley or highway. 
5.  The zoning administrator shall have the right, and it shall be the duty, to supervise the installation of any such private sign and also to inspect the same from time to time to ascertain whether or not the same is securely fastened and free from danger to the public. The building inspector shall have the right to require from time to time any repairs, extra supports or any other precautions necessary to protect the public safety, and in the event the owner fails to comply with any such requirements the permit for such private sign shall be revoked and the sign shall be removed. 
6.  This subsection C. shall not apply to signs erected by or for churches, service clubs, public or quasi-public organizations when such installations have been approved by the common council.

NOTES: 
(A) Building wall area is determined by using the square footage of the exterior wall of the first floor area to be signed (including window and door openings). 
(B) Permitted wall signage shall be divided among each tenant space. Maximum total size equals ten percent of the first floor area of the building wall upon which the signs will be placed. 
(C) Window sign area cannot exceed one-third of each individual window glass area on or in which the window signs are located. 
(D) Signage for projects with a PD (Planned Development District) shall be as specified by the approved Specific Implementation Plan for each particular project. Sign requirements for PD districts shall generally be based on the signage requirements in the most comparable standard zoning district. 
(E) Calculating freestanding sign square foot. Sign area is the maximum size of the sign a business is allowed to display (up to one hundred square feet). It is calculated using the width of the street frontage (A in illustration H). Example: if the street frontage is one hundred forty-one feet, then it is one hundred forty-one feet × forty-five percent = sixty-four square feet is the max size freestanding sign.

1.  For freestanding signs, see also the limitations in Section 19.54.050D. 
2.  Any number of window signs used shall count as only one sign in total against this maximum. If the only window signs used are those allowed under Section 19.54.050G., then such signs shall not count against this maximum. 
3.  Any sign for a business included within a group sign, as defined in Section 19.54.020B.9., shall count as one sign against the total number of permanent business signs permitted, except that for cases where a business has or shares more than one public building entrance, an additional group sign shall be permitted which indicates that and other businesses. 
4.  Sandwich board/pedestal signs, directional signs, auxiliary signs, and "ghost" signs not related to the current business operation shall not count against the total number of permanent business signs permitted. 
B.  For corner lots, permitted signage may be placed on either or both facades facing a public street. 
C.  Pylon signs, internally illuminated signs, electronic message center signs, and restoration of "ghost" signs shall be allowed in the B-2 district by conditional use, except for sign face/component changes on pre-existing signs of these types, which instead may be accomplished through the site plan review process under Chapter 19.63. 
Upon receipt of a completed conditional use permit application for any such new sign in the B-2 district, the zoning administrator shall forward such application to the Downtown Whitewater design team.

Chapter 19.55 - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES 
 
19.55.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a thorough and consistent set of standards for the siting and installation of wireless communications facilities in the various zoning districts in which they may be allowed, and more generally to protect the public health, safety, welfare, aesthetics and natural environment of the city in such a manner that does not unduly interfere with the placement and construction of said facilities. More specifically, the intent of this chapter is to: 
A.  Mitigate the potential for adverse visual impacts caused by wireless telecommunications facilities through design and siting standards. 
B.  Ensure that a business environment characterized by high service quality, competition and nondiscrimination prevails with regard to wireless telecommunication services in a manner consistent with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
C.  Establish a clear process for obtaining necessary permits for wireless telecommunications facilities that adequately protect the interests of the citizens of the city while minimizing the burden of compliance to service providers. 
D.  Protect environmentally and aesthetically sensitive areas of the city by restricting the design, height, location and operation of wireless telecommunications facilities in these areas, and by promoting their disguise, camouflage, screening or other design treatments intended to minimize their obtrusiveness. 
E.  Encourage use of multiple-antenna alternative support structures such as buildings and water towers as an alternative to stand-alone, single-use, single-provider structures, and require good faith attempts for co-location of facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.020 - Applicability. 
The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all new wireless telecommunications facilities that had not received a building permit prior to adoption of this chapter. Wireless telecommunications facilities, which pre-exist this chapter, or have been legally permitted prior to its adoption, shall not be required to meet the requirements contained herein. This chapter is not intended to regulate residential satellite dishes that are thirty-six inches or less in diameter, residential television antennas, or amateur radio facilities, which instead are regulated under Section 19.06.110. This chapter shall not be construed as to override additional or more stringent federal or state of Wisconsin requirements, including but not limited to any regulations or restrictions imposed by the State Bureau of Aeronautics, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.030 - Areas where wireless telecommunication facilities allowed. 
Chapter 19.15 to Chapter 19.48 identify the zoning districts in which wireless telecommunications facilities may be allowed, and what types of facilities are allowed as permitted or conditional uses. In no case shall a wireless telecommunications facility be located in or on districts or sites listed on the State or National Register of Historic Places, or within environmental corridors, wetlands, floodplains, or critical species habitats mapped by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, or through more detailed field surveys. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.040 - Type of approval required. 
In zoning districts where they are allowed, the first wireless telecommunications facility to be located on an alternative support structure and all new freestanding wireless communication facilities shall require a conditional use permit, and shall meet the standards in this chapter and Chapter 19.66 to obtain approval. In zoning districts where they are allowed, the second or greater wireless telecommunications facility to be located on an alternative support structure already supporting a wireless telecommunications facility or on a pre-existing wireless telecommunications facility shall be allowed as a permitted use, except that any addition or extension to an existing wireless telecommunications facility that adds more than ten feet to the overall height of the existing facility or alternative support structure shall require a conditional use permit. In zoning districts where wireless telecommunication facilities are allowed, wireless telecommunication support facilities shall be allowed as permitted accessory uses upon the establishment of the principal facility. All wireless telecommunication facilities and wireless telecommunication support facilities shall be subject to plan review in accordance with Chapter 19.63. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.050 - Required application submittal information. 
With the application for plan review or conditional use permit for a wireless telecommunications facility, the petitioner shall submit all information required under Section 19.63.020, along with the following additional information: 
A.  The identity, legal status, signature and contact information of the carrier, service provider, petitioner, and landowner. 
B.  FCC license and registration numbers if applicable. 
C.  A report prepared by a Wisconsin licensed engineer certifying the structural design of the telecommunications facility of a new freestanding wireless telecommunications facility as proposed and its physical ability to accommodate, either initially or at some time in the future, a total of at least three antenna arrays for separate providers. 
D.  In the case of a leased site, a lease agreement, option or binding lease instrument which does not preclude the lessee from entering into sub-leases on the site at market rates with another co-locating provider(s) and includes the legal description and amount of property lease. 
E.  For a proposed wireless telecommunications facility within a one-mile radius of an airport, copies of an affidavit of notification indicating that the airport operator and airport property owner have been notified via certified mail, along with copies of the determination of no hazard from the FAA or any other finds of the Wisconsin State Bureau of Aeronautics, such as they may apply. 
F.  Proof of a satisfactory level of liability insurance coverage, with the city of Whitewater listed as an additional named insured party. 
G.  Certified statement and map prepared by a licensed radio frequency engineer showing the coverage area of the proposed facility. 
H.  For a wireless telecommunications facility that requires a conditional use permit, a feasibility analysis that identifies at least three alternative sites, pre-existing freestanding wireless telecommunications facilities, and/or alternative support structures that could technically support a comparable level of service. The intent of this analysis is to present options to minimize the number, size, and adverse environmental impacts of wireless telecommunications facilities. The analysis shall specifically address the potential for co-location on pre-existing freestanding wireless telecommunications facilities and the use of alternative support structures. It shall also explain the rationale for selection of the proposed site in view of the relative merits of the alternatives. Approval of the project is subject to the plan and architectural review commission's determination that the chosen site is more advantageous than any other alternative site that is both technically feasible and available for use. The plan and architectural review commission may choose to independently verify the findings of the analysis at the applicant's expense. 
I.  For a wireless telecommunications facility that requires a conditional use permit, a performance bond in the amount of $20,000.00 naming the city as obligee, as security for the potential future removal of abandoned or inactivated facilities. 
J.  For a wireless telecommunications facility that would be set back from any property line or, principal building a distance less than the height of the facility, including the height of any alternative support structure, an analysis prepared by a licensed structural engineer demonstrating that the facility would not pose a threat to the public, existing principal buildings or adjacent properties in the event of failure. 
K.  The amount and location of any fuel proposed to be stored on site. 
L.  Any other information that the zoning administrator may deem necessary. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.060 - Co-location and use of alternative support structures. 
A.  In its review of alternative sites considered by the petitioner, the plan and architectural review commission shall prioritize reasonable alternatives that involve co-locating the new facility on an existing freestanding wireless telecommunications facility or locating the new facility on an alternative support structure, such as a tall building, water tower, smokestack, or electrical transmission tower. Co-location or use of an alternative support structure shall not be required on any facility or structure not structurally designed to accommodate a new wireless telecommunications facility. 
B.  All freestanding wireless telecommunication facilities issued a conditional use permit after the effective date of this chapter, known hereinafter as "host facilities," shall make available space for the co-location of telecommunications antennas or antenna arrays for at least two additional competing wireless telecommunications providers, including space for wireless telecommunication support facilities. This requirement does not apply if the owner or operator of the host facility can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the plan and architectural review commission, that the placement of the additional antennas or equipment would impair or disrupt, for a significant period of time, the service provided by the host facility. 
C.  Where a wireless telecommunication facility provider proposes to utilize an alternative support structure, the provider shall make available space for the co-location of telecommunications antennas or antenna arrays for at least two additional competing wireless telecommunications providers to the extent practical, and shall thereafter be considered a host facility. If the plan and architectural review commission determines based on evidence supplied by the applicant that the proposed facility or alternative support structure is not structurally sound or not otherwise appropriate for additional antennas or arrays, the commission may waive this requirement. 
D.  All new wireless telecommunication facilities and sites shall be designed to promote sharing of both tower space and ancillary facilities such as access roads, parking areas, buildings, and utilities. 
E.  The owner or operator of the host facility shall make co-location space reasonably available to other competing providers at prevailing market lease rates for the industry. Failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit. 
F.  Alternative support structures must be at least fifty feet in height to be considered for the addition of a wireless telecommunication facility, not including the height of any architectural projections. The plan and architectural review commission may deny the placement of numerous wireless telecommunication facilities on a single alternative support structure if it determines that such placement would have a negative aesthetic, architectural, public safety, or operational impact. 
G.  Wireless telecommunications facilities located on alternative support structures shall be considered accessory uses. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.070 - Structural, design and aesthetic standards. 
All wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed and sited in such a manner to minimize or avoid adverse safety, aesthetic or environmental effects per the following requirements: 
A.  Compliance with All Applicable Restrictions. All wireless telecommunications facilities shall comply with all city, state and federal regulations, restrictions, codes, standards and power density limits, including other city zoning ordinance standards. 
B.  Materials. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be constructed of metal or other nonflammable material, and freestanding facilities shall be self supporting monopoles or lattice towers, unless otherwise permitted by the plan and architectural review commission. Material color shall blend with surroundings. 
C.  Placement. All wireless telecommunications facilities and support facilities shall be located and installed in such a manner to minimize disturbance to, take advantage of, or locate behind existing topography and vegetation to minimize visual impact on surrounding properties and public rights-of-way. No wireless telecommunication facility shall be placed in a location that would physically obstruct or otherwise interfere with the full use of other wireless telecommunication facilities, residential satellite dishes, residential television or radio antennas, or amateur radio facilities. 
D.  Setback. The minimum setback of a new wireless telecommunications facility from all property lines and principal buildings on the site shall equal the height of the wireless telecommunications facility, including the height of any alternative support structure. A reduced setback below this minimum may be considered by the plan and architectural review commission based on submittal of a structural engineering analysis demonstrating that the facility would not pose a threat to the public, existing principal buildings, or adjacent properties in the event of failure. All wireless telecommunications support facilities shall be set back from property lines the same distance as required for principal buildings in the zoning district. 
E.  Height. The maximum height above existing grade for any freestanding wireless telecommunications facility, including all antennas, shall be two hundred and fifty feet. Any wireless telecommunications facility mounted on an alternative support structure may extend no greater than fifty feet above the height of an alternative support structure that is less than two hundred feet in height, or no greater than ten feet above the height of an alternative support structure that is two hundred feet in height or greater. The plan and architectural review commission may approve waivers to such height limitations if necessary to facilitate co-location of facilities. 
F.  Wireless Telecommunications Support Facilities. All wireless telecommunications support facilities shall be located within enclosed buildings or fully screened rooftop locations. Such accessory buildings shall not exceed fifteen feet in height and twelve hundred square feet in area, unless otherwise permitted by the plan and architectural review commission to facilitate co-location. The design and exterior surfacing of all such buildings or rooftop screening structures shall be in harmony with the existing or desired architecture for the area. The exterior walls of all such buildings shall be masonry, stone, stucco, pre-cast, concrete or other similar surface. 
G.  Signage. No commercial message or signage shall be allowed at or on any wireless telecommunications facility, wireless telecommunications support facility, or site used for a wireless telecommunications facility. 
H.  Driveways. Access driveways shall be surfaced in accordance with the requirements of Section 19.51.110. 
I.  Landscaping and Fencing. The site including the wireless telecommunications facility shall be attractively landscaped, with particular emphasis on landscaping near buildings, tower foundations, and driveways. New vegetation for screening purposes shall be a minimum of five feet in height upon planting and shall be located on the outside of any required fencing. The base of all freestanding wireless telecommunications facilities shall be enclosed with security fencing, unless the applicant provides other acceptable improvements designed to secure the base of the facility (tower) from public access. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.080 - Abandonment and removal. 
Any wireless telecommunications facility not continuously operating for a period of twelve months shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed (along with its wireless telecommunication support facilities) within ninety days of receiving an order to remove from the zoning administrator. The cost of removal and site restoration shall be borne entirely by the permit holder. In the event that the permit holder fails to remove the facility, the city may cash the required performance bond and remove the facility and all support facilities itself. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.55.090 - Compliance. 
A.  All wireless telecommunications facilities granted site plan or conditional use permit approval after the effective date of this chapter shall remain in compliance with approved plans, conditions of approval, the provisions of this chapter as they existed at the time of permit approval, and applicable standards of Sections 19.63.100 and 19.66.050.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, adopted April 4, 2019, repealed Ch. 19.60, §§ 19.60.010—19.60.050, and enacted a new Ch. 19.60, §§ 19.60.010—19.60.070, as set out herein. The former chapter pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1914A, adopted Feb. 18, 2016. 
 
19.60.010 - Nonconforming uses, structures, and lots. 
Existing lawful nonconforming uses, structures, and lots shall meet the provisions of this title, and those located within floodplains, shorelands, and shoreland-wetlands shall also comply with the city floodplain, shoreland, and shoreland-wetland regulations, whichever are more restrictive. 
(Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, 4-4-2019)  
19.60.020 - Existing nonconforming uses. 
The lawful nonconforming use of land or water; or a lawful nonconforming use in a conforming or nonconforming structure; or a lawful nonconforming use on a conforming or nonconforming lot that existed at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be continued although the use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter; however: 
(1)  Only that portion of the structure, fixture, land, or water in actual use may be so continued and the nonconforming use may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, or moved except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this title. 
(2)  Discontinuance. If such nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of twelve months, any future use of the structure, fixture, or premises shall conform to the provisions of this title. 
(3)  Abolishment or Destruction. When a nonconforming use or a structure with a nonconforming use is damaged by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, infestation, or other calamity to the extent of more than fifty percent of its equalized assessed value, it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use provisions of this title. 
(4)  Total lifetime structural repair or alterations to a structure, fixture, or premises containing a nonconforming use shall not exceed fifty percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure, fixture, or premises at the time its use became nonconforming unless it is permanently changed to a conforming use in accordance with the use provisions of this title. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are not considered structural repairs, modifications, or additions. Some examples of such repairs include painting, caulking, decorating, paneling, and other nonstructural components; and the repair or replacement of doors, windows, utilities, and sewage treatment and water supply systems. Figure No. 1 reflects the method by which the director of neighborhood services shall determine when modifications to nonconforming uses and their structures are equal to fifty percent. 
(5)  Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the board of zoning appeals if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use with neighboring uses. 
(Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, 4-4-2019)  
19.60.030 - Conforming structures on nonconforming lots. 
The conforming use of a conforming structure existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be continued although the lot area and/or width does not conform to the requirements of this title. 
(1)  Additions and enlargements to such structures are permitted provided they conform to the established yard/setback, height, parking, loading, access provisions, and other development regulations of this title, other than minimum lot dimensional requirements. 
(2)  Existing structures on nonconforming lots that are damaged or destroyed by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, infestation, or other calamity may be reconstructed provided they conform to the established yard/setback, height, parking, loading, access provisions, and other development regulations of this title, other than minimum lot dimensional requirements. 
(Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, 4-4-2019)  
19.60.040 - Nonconforming structures on conforming or nonconforming lots. 
(a)  A nonconforming structure with a conforming use lawfully existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be continued although the structure's size or location does not conform to the development regulations of this title. 
(b)  Nonconforming structures with a conforming use may be repaired, maintained, renovated, rebuilt, or remodeled, subject to building code and other applicable requirements. No prohibition or limits based on cost may be imposed on the repair, maintenance, renovation, or remodeling of such structures. 
(c)  Additions and enlargements to existing nonconforming structures with a conforming use are permitted and shall conform to the established yard/setback, height, parking, loading, and access provisions of this title. Existing buildings and their additions shall not be permitted to encroach further upon established yard/setback and height requirements than the existing encroachment. The provisions of this subsection with respect to additions or enlargements are applicable only if the lot is served by public sanitary sewer or, if relevant, conforms with existing sanitary code requirements for private onsite sewage treatment systems (POWTS). 
(d)  Existing nonconforming structures may be moved and shall conform to the established yard/setback, height, parking, loading, and access provisions of this title. 
(e)  A nonconforming structure with a conforming use that is damaged or destroyed by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, infestation, or other calamity may be restored or replaced to the size, location, and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, subject to building code and other applicable requirements. No limits may be imposed on the costs of the repair, reconstruction, or improvement of said structure. The size of the structure may be larger than the size immediately before the damage or destruction occurred if necessary for the structure to comply with applicable state or federal requirements. Any reconstruction shall conform to the development regulations of this title, to the extent practicable, and existing sanitary code requirements, and shall commence within twenty-four months of the date of damage or destruction, unless an extension is granted by the government agency having authority. 
(Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, 4-4-2019)  
19.60.050 - Vacant nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Development. The zoning administrator may issue a building permit for development of a vacant lot which does not contain sufficient area to conform to the lot dimensional requirements of this title to be used as a building site provided that the use is allowed in the zoning district in which it is located; the lot is of record in the county register of deeds office prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or amendment thereof; and development is compatible with the character of the surrounding area. Nonconforming (substandard) lots to be served by public sanitary sewer shall be at least fifty feet wide and seven thousand two hundred square feet in area. Nonconforming lots to be served by POWTS shall be at least one hundred feet wide and forty thousand square feet in area. Lots with smaller dimensions than mentioned above shall not be developed unless a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals. 
Development of vacant nonconforming lots granted permits under this section shall be required to meet the yard/setback, height, parking, loading, access provisions, and other development regulations, except lot size requirements unless otherwise specified, of this title. A building permit for the improvement of a lot with lesser dimensions and requisites than those stated above may be issued only after a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals. 
(b)  Statutory Provisions. In accordance with Wis. Stats. § 66.10015(2)(e), a property owner of a legal nonconforming (substandard) lot may: 
(1)  Convey an ownership interest in a substandard lot. 
(2)  Use the substandard lot as a building site if all of the following apply: 
(A)  The substandard lot or parcel has never been developed with one or more of its structures placed partly upon an adjacent lot or parcel. 
(B)  The substandard lot or parcel is developed to comply with all other requirements of this title, except the minimum lot dimensional requirement unless otherwise specified. 
(c)  Merging. In accordance with Wis. Stats. 66.10015(4), the city may not require one or more lots to be merged with another lot, for any purpose, without the consent of the owners of the lots that are to be merged. 
(Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, 4-4-2019)  
19.60.060 - Changes and substitutions. 
Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform to the requirements of this title, it shall not revert back to a nonconforming use or structure. The board of zoning appeals may permit the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use. Once the board of zoning appeals has permitted the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use, the prior existing use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and the substituted more restrictive nonconforming use shall be subject to all the conditions required by the board of zoning appeals. 
(Ord. No. 1976A, § 4, 4-4-2019)  
19.60.070 - Definitions. 
Definitions of terms used in this chapter include: 
(1)  "Development regulations" means those portions of this title pertaining to lot area, lot width, structure size, yard/setback, frontage, height, parking, loading, or separation distance requirements. 
(2)  "Nonconforming lot" means a lot, the area, dimensions, or location that existed at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or an amendment thereto that does not conform to current regulations of this title. Such nonconforming lots are also referred to as substandard lots. 
(3)  "Nonconforming use" means a use of structure (including buildings), fixture, or premises (land or water) that existed at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or an amendment thereto that does not conform to the current use restrictions of this title. 
(4)  "Nonconforming structure" means a dwelling, building, or other structure that existed lawfully at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or an amendment thereto that does not conform to one or more of the development regulations of this title. Any such structure conforming with respect to use (containing a conforming use) but not in respect to development regulations shall be considered a nonconforming structure and not a nonconforming use. 
Figure No. 1 
IS IT FIFTY PERCENT YET? 
Sample Problem: Let's assume that the owner of a house with a nonconforming use (i.e., nonconforming institutional use in a residential zoned home) wishes to add a room to the house. If the house had an equalized assessed value of one hundred thousand dollars in 1997, the property owner would be able to make improvements valued at up to fifty percent of the present (1997) equalized assessed value of the house, or fifty thousand dollars at that time. The improvement would have to be built to zoning standards. Any further additions or structural alterations could not be allowed unless the use of the structure is permanently changed to a conforming use. 
Additions and modifications are based upon a given time over the life of a structure. If, in the example above, the property owner constructed a fifty thousand dollars addition in 1997, no further additions could be allowed because the fifty percent improvement limit had been reached. However, let's assume that the addition was valued at twenty thousand dollars or twenty percent of the 1997 equalized assessed value of the structure (one hundred thousand dollars). Ten years later, the property owner again comes in, wishing to add an attached storage room. In the meantime, the equalized assessed value of the house has increased from one hundred thousand dollars in 1997 to one hundred fifty thousand dollars in 2007. The value of the storage room is fifteen thousand dollars in 2007. The property owner has now accumulated modifications totaling thirty percent of the equalized assessed values from 1997 and 2007. 
Finally, ten years later, when the equalized assessed value of the house is two hundred thousand dollars, the property owner again comes in wishing to modify his house to the extent of forty thousand dollars. The cumulative percentage of the modifications totals fifty percent, based on the cumulative percentage of each modification in relation to the equalized assessed value of the house in the year the modification was made. 
This example is further clarified in the following table: 
(NOTE—The base for calculation is not the original value of the house at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted, but is the equalized assessed value of the house at each time the house is modified.) 
Year 	Equalized
Assessed
Value of Home 	Value of
Modification 	Modification as a
Percentage of
Assessed
Value 	Cumulative
Percentage 
1997 	$100,000 	$20,000 	20 	20 
2007 	$150,000 	$15,000 	10 	30 
2017 	$200,000 	$40,000 	20 	50 
 
Definition: "Equalized assessed value" is the value of a structure and/or lot of property as determined by the local assessor with any adjustments made to account for an assessment that does not reflect "full" (one hundred percent) value. Full assessed value of the structure and/or lot is usually equivalent to "full" (one hundred percent) fair market value at the time assessment is made.

14.  Perform such activities as are reasonably required to conduct the responsibilities enumerated herein, and respond to requests or directives from supervising officials of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.75.030 - Zoning administrator—Ordinance interpretation duties. 
A.  A primary duty of the zoning administrator is interpretation of the ordinance codified in this title. The zoning administrator shall respond expeditiously to requests for clarification and interpretation. The administrator is encouraged to seek counsel of the city attorney in making such interpretations. 
B.  Informal and unwritten interpretations by the zoning administrator are not binding upon the city government, nor are those written interpretations that are expressly stated not to be binding. The zoning administrator shall have sole authority to decide when an interpretation shall be put in writing, except that the administrator shall make response to duly filed permit applications. 
C.  Written interpretations by the zoning administrator are binding upon the city unless they are expressly made nonbinding. The written interpretation placed on this title by the zoning administrator shall be the official city interpretation unless that interpretation is retracted or revised in writing by the zoning administrator, or until it is reversed or modified by order of the board of zoning appeals or by a court. 
D.  Written interpretations by the zoning administrator may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals as provided in Wisconsin Statute 62.23(7)(e)7, and in Chapter 19.72. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.75.035 - Public information. 
To the fullest extent possible, the zoning administrator shall make available to the public all reports and documents concerning the city comprehensive plan and any component thereof. In addition, available information in the form of reports, bulletins, maps, and engineering data shall be readily available and widely distributed. The plan commission may set fees necessary to recover the costs of providing information to the public. Where useful, the zoning administrator, or his agent, may set marks on bridges or buildings or other markers which show the depth of the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood; or may set markers delineating the boundaries of wetlands. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.75.040 - Zoning administrator—Permit issuance duties. 
A.  Most types of land use change that are regulated by this title require a permit to be issued before the change may be legally undertaken. (See Chapter 19.63, Plan Review.) The zoning administrator's decision whether to issue a zoning permit is an interpretation decision in which the terms of this title are applied to a projected land use as described in the permit application and accompanying documents. When a permit is issued, the city is communicating its official statement that the land use described in the permit application is deemed to be legal under this title as Title 19 stands at that time. A permit that is issued does not, by itself, vest a right to complete the land use change. Changes in law or ordinance may have the effect of cancelling city approval if these occur before the project is far enough toward consummation to have a vested right to proceed to completion. A permit that is issued applies only to the development project as it is specifically described in the application. Permits may be time limited in their duration to allow a re-review of prevailing conditions. 
B.  Every application for a zoning permit shall contain the information required in Section 19.63.020, on plan review application requirements. The administrator may also require evidence of compliance with other applicable laws or ordinances as a condition precedent to the issuance of a zoning permit. 
C.  Any permit obtained through material misrepresentation shall be null and void. Coincident with the issuing of a permit, the zoning administrator shall prepare a card, certifying that a permit has been issued. This card shall bear the same number as the permit and shall identify the construction and premises covered by the permit. This card shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises during construction and no construction shall be commenced until this card has been posted. 
D.  If the zoning administrator deems it appropriate, conditions may be placed on the permit. The permit card shall spell out the Title 19 requirements as applied by the zoning administrator to the development proposal. A full set of conditions shall be retained by the zoning administrator and a summary of pertinent parts shall be communicated in writing to the owner, agents and contractors. 
E.  When a fully completed permit application is submitted and is then denied by the zoning administrator, the denial and the reasons for the denial shall be recorded in the records of the zoning office, and this decision shall be appealable under subsection D. of Section 19.75.030. Permit denials that are done without presentation of a fully completed application and the issuance of a denial on that application are not appealable. 
F.  Issuance of a permit is equivalent to a written interpretation decision and is appealable as provided in subsection D. of Section 19.75.030. 
G.  Where a development requires a uniform state building permit, the zoning permit may take the form of inscription of zoning approval on the building permit and description of pertinent conditions in the file and on the permit placard. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.75.050 - Certificate of zoning compliance requirements. 
No building or addition thereto constructed after June 24, 1982, the effective date of this Title 19, and no addition to a previously existing building shall be occupied, and no land (except that used for garden purposes, or for public recreation purposes and without buildings or structures), which is vacant on June 24, 1982, shall be used for any purpose until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the zoning administrator. No use shall be changed until the certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the zoning administrator. The application for and processing of a request for such a certificate shall be the same as for a zoning permit. A certificate of zoning compliance shall state that the uses of the property are legal under the zoning ordinance, either by expressed terms of the ordinance, or as a matter of nonconforming usage. Conditions or qualifications may be appended. 
(Ord. No. 1914A, 2-18-2016)  
19.75.060 - Zoning administrator—Inspection of properties for zoning compliance—City attorney duties. 
A.  It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to inspect or cause to be inspected all properties for which a zoning permit has been issued to determine whether the development of land use change that was the subject of the permit has occurred in full compliance with this title. The acceptance by an applicant of a zoning permit grants consent to the zoning administrator to make such inspections as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance. 
B.  It shall also be the duty of the zoning administrator to inspect or cause to be inspected all properties within the jurisdiction of this title for compliance with the terms of this title. Inspections may be at random, under a routine pattern, as a follow-up to permit issuance, or upon complaint or inquiry. Based on the possible violation, the zoning administrator or designee may inspect the property. 
C.  Where facts obtained from inspection or by other means lead the zoning administrator to conclude that a violation of this title probably exists, the zoning administrator shall create an evidentiary file documenting the basis for this conclusion. After completion and review of this file, the zoning administrator may take the following initial enforcement actions on his/her own motion: 
1.  Communicate in person, by letter, or telephone, with the owner, the architect, contractors, or other relevant parties, expressing the conclusion that a violation probably exists, requesting information, requesting that the parties review the compliance question, and that they communicate with the zoning administrator on this matter within a specified time appropriate to the circumstances. 
2.  Where the zoning administrator deems it appropriate to prevent further construction or alteration, a stop-work order may be issued by the administrator. This order shall be prominently posted on the property and mailed to relevant parties, and it shall demand that work violating this title be halted immediately and shall advise its readers and recipients to contact the zoning administrator's office. 
3.  Where the zoning administrator deems it appropriate, the zoning administrator may issue a citation for a zoning ordinance violation, under the city's citation ordinance. 
4.  All written communications, including stop-work orders, shall have an expressed time limit for contact with the zoning office, and shall advise that the matter will be turned over to the city attorney for legal action on that date unless the matter has been resolved. 
D.  Where enforcement actions described in subsection C. above have not satisfied the zoning administrator that the property and its usage have been made to comply, the evidentiary file and all correspondence shall be turned over to the city attorney. The city attorney shall review the file. The attorney may require an evidentiary hearing before making a prosecutorial decision. If the file is deemed by the city attorney not to show a probable violation, the city attorney shall so indicate in an explanatory letter, and pertinent parties shall be so notified. If the city attorney does not so conclude, the attorney shall immediately issue a letter to the violating parties and other pertinent individuals establishing a specific timetable for compliance to be accomplished and specifying that legal action will be taken if compliance is not accomplished within the time period specified.
