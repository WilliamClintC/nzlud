The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the
people. The purpose of this chapter is to establish ethical standards of
conduct for all such officials and to direct disclosure by such officials of

intent of this chapter.
§ 2.46.020. Responsibilities of public office.
Public officials and employees are bound to observe in their official acts
the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties
of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the
public interest must be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their
official and private affairs shall be above reproach. Public officials are

municipality.

or in the Village's effective functioning outweigh an interest in free
speech to disclose the information. Confidential information includes
but is not limited to information where the disclosure is prohibited by
common law or state or federal law or statute unless the release of
same is ordered pursuant to a lawful order of a court or the informed
consent of the subject, as applicable. Information that is subject to the

of the official himself or other officials, employees or agencies in order
to obtain favored treatment or special consideration to advance the
personal or private interests of himself or others. Any written unilateral
communication received by a public official or employee in matters

authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for
inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a
notice containing a description of its organization and the established

[Amended by Ord. No. A-542-89, 1989; Ord. No. 006, Series
2004]
A. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal
custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably
describes the requested record or the information requested. However,
a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject
matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a
sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be
in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under
§ 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be
refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be
identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be
§ 3.32.040 GRAFTON CODE § 3.32.050
1.01:64
refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of
a fee is required under § 3.32.040F.6. A requester may be required to
show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept
at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or
regulations so require.
B. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as
practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the
requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole
or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after
conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a written request
is so general as to be unduly time-consuming, the party making the
request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner
which would permit reasonable compliance.
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 3.32.060. If a
request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a
demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is
made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a
written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive
a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every
written denial of a request shall inform the requester that, if the
request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is
subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under
§ 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the Attorney General or a
district attorney.
D. Except as otherwise indicated, information, access to records, requests
for records, and copies of records may be made to or obtained from the
designated legal custodian, as follows: [Amended at time of adoption

including performance evaluations, judgments or
recommendations concerning future salary adjustments or other

violation.
2. Any record obtained by the authority through a subpoena or search
warrant.
3. Any record prepared by an employer other than the authority if it
contains information relating to an employee of that employer,
unless the employee authorizes the authority to provide access to
that information.
D. No notice is required when access is provided to the employee who is
the subject of the record or to his or her representative or bargaining
representative. Notice is not required when an authority releases a

Except as modified by the regulations for the division and platting of land in
Title 18, Subdivisions, of this Code, the construction cost of storm sewers is
to be prorated. For the purpose of having the cost of storm sewers equitably
proportioned between the Village and the property owners, the cost of the
same shall be prorated as follows:
A. The amount which the owner shall pay shall be based upon the ratio of
the area of each owner's "contributing parcel" fronting on or within 500
feet of said improvement to the entire "contribution area" tributary to
said improvement.
B. A "contributing parcel" shall be defined as:
1. A lot within a platted subdivision, the majority of whose area
contributes to an abutting street which contains or drains to said
improvement; or
2. An unplatted parcel of land which fronts on or contributes to a
street containing or draining to the said improvement, where:
a. The depth shall be defined as 135 feet as measured at right
angles to the street line where the drainage area falls away
from the street or improvement; or
b. The depth shall be defined as the depth of the parcel from the
street line or from the improvement, where no street exists, to
the rear limits of the contributing drainage area where the
drainage area contributes to the said improvement and where
no future storm sewer extensions will be made in the parcel's
drainage area;
c. In Subsection B.2 of this section, where future storm sewer
extensions will be made into the drainage area, the depth shall
be considered as 135 feet as measured at right angles to the
said future improvement.
d. The width shall be defined as the width of the contributing
parcel which falls within the tributary drainage area of said
improvement.
C. The "contribution area" shall be defined as the sum of all "contributing
parcels," defined above, to be assessed and shall not include street
area.

engineering and administration fee of 15%.
F. The cost for the services for obtaining assessment bonds for the
purpose of paying for this improvement program shall be a part of the
cost of this said improvement.
G. The cost per square foot to be assessed to the contributing and/or
abutting property shall be the ratio of the total cost of the improvement

related appurtenances shall be assessed as follows:
§ 3.36.030 GRAFTON CODE § 3.36.040
1.01:72
1. It being understood that owners of single-family residential
properties benefit similarly from the availability of sanitary sewers
regardless of the length of front footage of the owners' properties,
the single-family residential properties abutting an eight-inch
sanitary sewer shall be assessed a fixed cost as calculated by the
Village Engineer and approved by the Village Board. Said
calculation shall be based upon the ENR Index eight-inch sanitary
sewer, constructed at a normal depth and at a standard length. All
other properties abutting an eight-inch sanitary sewer shall be
assessed at cost not to exceed the ENR Index eight-inch sanitary
sewer, constructed at a normal depth. In the event of a mixed-use
assessment, involving a combination of single-family residential

2. It being understood that owners of single-family residential
properties benefit similarly from the availability of sanitary sewers
regardless of the length of front footage of the owners' properties,
the single-family residential properties abutting the oversized
sewer shall be assessed a fixed cost as calculated by the Village
Engineer and approved by the Village Board. Said calculation shall
be based upon an equivalent eight-inch sewer, at a normal depth
and a standard length, if the oversized sewer is or can reasonably
be expected to be used by the abutting properties in lieu of an
eight-inch collector sewer. All other properties abutting the
oversized sewer shall be assessed for the cost of an equivalent
eight-inch sewer at a normal depth, if the oversized sewer is or can
reasonably be expected to be used by the abutting properties in
lieu of an eight-inch collector sewer. In the event of a mixed-use
assessment, involving single-family residential uses and other uses,
the Village Engineer shall attempt to apportion the sanitary sewer
costs in a uniform manner, always considering the policy set forth
herein. [Amended by Ord. No. 014, Series 2003; Ord. No. 012,
Series 2005]
3. The costs of an oversized sanitary sewer not assessed as an
equivalent eight-inch sewer shall be prorated among the properties
in the service area, based upon gross acres in the service area. In
no case shall the prorated costs (not otherwise assessed as an
equivalent eight-inch sewer) exceed the "cap" figure per acre as
established annually.
4. In some instances, ten-inch sanitary sewer may be required, at the
discretion of the Department of Public Works. In these cases, the
developer shall be reimbursed the over-sizing cost of materials by
the Department.

"connection fee" or "right to connect" fee will be determined per
interceptor special assessment methods outlined herein.
6. Project service areas shall be as delineated by the Village Engineer
and approved by the Village Board. In general, delineation of
service area will be serviceability rather than land use, either
ultimate or proposed.
7. The assessment cost of an eight-inch sanitary sewer shall be
established annually by the Village Engineer. [Amended by Ord.
No. 014, Series 2003]
8. The limitations on length of sewer to be assessed, set forth in
Subsection C.1 and 2 above shall only apply to single-family
residential lots within the Village or to be annexed to the Village
that were created prior to January 2004. [Amended by Ord. No.
012, Series 2005]
D. Timing of fee collection.
1. Any area or parcels already within the Village limits that are
benefited from the installation of the interceptor sewer and
appurtenances will be required to pay the applicable special
assessment at the time of final plat approval.
2. Connection fees are normally collected prior to or at the time of
annexation to the Village. At Village Board discretion, collection of
these fees may be commuted to the time of official zoning adoption
by the Village Board for the annexed land.
E. Fee updating.
1. The area-wide interceptor assessment figure per acre shall be
adjusted annually by adding interest at one point above the average
rate at which money was borrowed or otherwise applied at the time
of project's payment. In no case shall the assessment cost per acre
in any year be less than the original per acre assessment.
2. The assessment cost of an equivalent eight-inch sewer shall be
updated annually in accordance with current costs for normal
eight-inch sewer construction, as determined by the Village
Engineer, utilizing the ENR Index. [Amended by Ord. No. 014,
Series 2003]

sidewalk construction shall be assessed to the abutting property
owners on a front-foot basis, as follows: [Amended by Ord. No. 014,
Series 2003; Ord. No. 016, Series 2003]
1. The assessable front footage shall be the actual lot width at the
minimum building setback line. In districts with no minimum
required setback line, the assessable front footage shall be the
actual lot width measured at a depth equal to 1/4 of the actual
average lot depth.
2. In the case of corner lots, the front footage shall be calculated as in
Subsection A.1 above for improvements on the front yard side of
the lot. The side yard shall be assessed at 50% of the side yard
frontage, provided the side yard frontage does not exceed 150 feet.
If the side yard exceeds 150 feet, that portion in excess of 150 feet
shall be assessed in the same manner as front yard frontage. On
properties in commercial, industrial or PID zoned districts, the side
yard frontage shall be assessed at 100%, irrespective of length.
3. For unplatted parcels, the assessable front footage shall be the
actual frontage of the parcel along the street being improved.
4. The quantity of new pavement which shall be assessed shall be
limited to an area of 16 square feet per front foot. The intent of this
provision is that the amount of new street assessed shall be limited

which will, when developed, drain into the improvement being
constructed.
B. When drainage districts are established, the Village Engineer shall
determine the area of each parcel in the district, and any assessment
for improvements shall be made on the basis of proportional area. In
the event that there are significant differences in the impervious areas
of properties in the district, the Board may make assessments on the
basis of proportional impervious area. In such cases, the impervious
area of undeveloped parcels shall be calculated based on the estimated
area under fully developed conditions. The impervious area of all singlefamily
residential lots shall be assumed to be 3,400 square feet.
C. No parcel shall be assessed for regional drainage improvements more
than once; however, multiple improvements may be included in one

improvements.
A. Intent. The intent of this section is to equitably assess the costs of
regional watershed improvements by specially assessing the costs of
those improvements benefiting property owners in accordance with this
section.
1. When the Village Board determines that a proposed watershed
improvement confers a special benefit upon a limited and
determinable area and is, therefore, subject to a special
assessment levied in accordance with the provisions of §§ 66.0701
and 66.0703, Wis. Stats., and § 3.36.010 of this chapter, including
assessment of all costs and expenses outlined therein, the Village
shall determine the amount of the applicable special assessment
for each parcel in the area benefited by the improvement utilizing
the proportional area method as required by § 3.36.060 of this
chapter. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1.01,
Code Adoption)]
2. Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner of any property
benefiting from the watershed improvement project and which
property is located within the corporate limits of the Village of
Grafton shall pay 50% of the special assessment calculated under
Subsection A.1 of this section and which is attributable to the
owner's property. No assessment shall be levied against parcels
which were in the Village and fully developed on May 18, 1998,
unless said parcels were subject to compliance with the provisions
of an approved stormwater management plan. [Amended by Ord.
No. 003, Series 2001]
3. The Village, in calculating the special assessments under
Subsection A.1 of this section, shall calculate any special
assessable amounts that are attributable to parcels of land which
are benefited by the watershed improvement but which lie outside
of the corporate limits of the Village of Grafton and which are,
therefore, beyond the Village's special assessment powers. The
Village shall place any special assessable amounts which are
attributable to properties lying outside the Village and which
assessments remain after application of any funding grants as
provided for herein on the Village's general property tax levy. In the
event said property owner seeks to annex the parcel of property
into the Village, the Village shall receive as an annexation fee, prior
to annexation, an amount equal to the special assessment as
calculated plus interest thereon at the annual rate of 8% per
annum.
4. In the event that the watershed improvement project qualifies for
any funding through a state or federal grant or similar funding
source and the Village actually receives said funds, the Village shall
apply those funds on a pro rata basis to the fifty-percent portion of

IMPACT FEES
§ 3.44.010. Purpose.
In order to provide for the capital costs for the construction, expansion
and improvement of public facilities, including the cost of land, legal,
engineering and design costs to serve growth in the Village of Grafton's
population, there are hereby imposed the following impact fees upon
developers to pay for the capital costs that are necessary to accommodate
land development in compliance with the requirements of § 66.0617, Wis.
Stats.
§ 3.44.020. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable as follows:
the special assessment that is the property owner's responsibility
under this policy. The pro rata reduction shall apply to special
assessments actually levied against properties located in the
Village and the amount that would have been specially assessed
against properties benefited by the improvement but which are
located outside the Village's corporate limits and, therefore, not
subject to special assessment by the Village.
5. The Village shall exercise its best efforts to coordinate work to be
performed in connection with the watershed improvement project
and the levy of any special assessment with any other municipality
having jurisdiction over properties located in the contributing
watershed which are benefited by the watershed improvement.
[Amended by Ord. No. 004, Series 1995]
A. Applicability to all land development for which an impact fee has not
been collected. The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to all
land development for which an impact fee has not been collected by the
Village prior to July 5, 1995.

§ 3.44.086. Police station facility needs assessment.
The Village of Grafton, in response to the 2001 Village of Grafton Police
Department Space Needs Study, has prepared a Police Facility Needs
Assessment, which is on file in the Village Clerk's office. In accordance with
§ 66.0617, Wis. Stats., the police station needs assessment evaluates the
physical adequacy of the original facility as well as a projection of the future
needs based on forecasted growth. The Police station needs assessment
considers any deficiencies that may have existed in the original police
station facility as well as the recommended police station expansion in
order to compensate for new development. The police station facility needs
assessment was utilized as a primary source for forecasting the future
demands for public services from projected residential and nonresidential
development and to determine the costs that shall be recovered from this
new growth in the form of an impact fee.
§ 3.44.088. Public works facilities needs assessment.
The Village of Grafton, in response to the 2003 Village of Grafton Public
Works Department Space Needs Study, has prepared a Public Works
Transportation Facility Needs Assessment and Impact Study, which is on
file in the Village Clerk's office. In accordance with § 66.0617, Wis. Stats.,
the Public Works Department needs assessment evaluates the physical
adequacy of the original facility as well as a projection of the future needs
based on forecasted growth. The Public Works Department needs
assessment considers any deficiencies that may have existed in the original
public works facility as well as the recommended public works facility
expansion in order to compensate for new development. The Public Works
Transportation Facility needs assessment was utilized as a primary source
for forecasting the future demands for public services from projected
residential and nonresidential development and to determine the costs that
shall be recovered from this new growth in the form of an impact fee.
B. The study evaluated the current park and recreational facilities and
new facilities needed to support anticipated growth within the
community. Park and recreational facilities needs within the Village of
Grafton are based on per capita standards, as established in the 2014
Park and Open Space Plan Update.
C. Each single-family residential unit constitutes one residential
equivalent unit (REU), whether located within a one-family, multifamily,
condominium, cooperative, rental or owner-occupied unit. Impact fees
for park and recreational facilities will be assessed only to residential
uses since the demand for these public facilities is generally utilized by
the residential portion of the community.

G. Retail reserve "Class B" license. Those licenses available under the
quota system existing before December 1, 1997, that were not granted
or issued by the municipality as of December 1, 1997. The number of
reserve "Class B" licenses available to a municipality is determined by a
series of calculations described in § 125.51(4), Wis. Stats.
1. Initial retail reserve "Class B" license fee. There shall be a tenthousand-
dollar fee, to be paid in addition to the regular Class "B"
and "Class B" fee under Subsections B and F above, upon approval
of a retail reserve "Class B" license. The ten-thousand-dollar fee
shall not be prorated, as required for the retail reserve "Class B"
license, if it is issued for a portion of the licensing period.
2. Business development grants for certain reserve "Class B" licenses.
a. Findings and purpose. 1997 Wisconsin Act 27, effective
December 1, 1997, establishes a new alcohol license called a
retail reserve "Class B" license, and requires that all who are
granted such a license pay an initial license fee of $10,000 in
addition to the regular Class "B" and "Class B" license fees. The
Village Board finds that businesses such as restaurants, hotels
and taverns make important contributions to the Village's
economy and serve important public purposes, including but
not limited to increasing the Village's property tax base,
providing employment and promoting tourism. The Village
Board also finds that the new initial fee for reserve "Class B"
licenses far exceeds the actual cost of licensing the activity and
that excessive license fees deter new business and are contrary
to economic growth. It is the purpose of this chapter to utilize
the excess revenue generated by Wisconsin Act 27 to assist
new reserve "Class B" licensees in order to assist in the
establishment of new businesses.
§ 5.16.030 GRAFTON CODE § 5.16.030

completes, executes and submits an application for a

Board, no earlier than three months or later than 12
months after the granting of said reserve license.
5. The retail reserve "Class B" licensee pays the initial tenthousand-
dollar fee to the Village.

agency or department, has certified that the applicant for
the business development grant is in full compliance with
the requirements of Ch. 125, Wis. Stats., and all local
ordinances governing the issuance of retail alcohol
beverage licenses.

development grant to the Village of Grafton.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
§ 9.35.010. Purpose and findings.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of citizens of the Village of Grafton, and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the Village of
Grafton. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the
First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it
the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
B. Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community, presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the Village, and on findings incorporated in the cases
of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of
Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S. 560
(1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); East of the
River Enterprises II v. City of Hudson, 2000 Wisc. App. Lexis 734 (Ct.
App. Aug. 1, 2000); Ben's Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702
(7th Cir. 2003), and on studies in other communities, including but not
limited to Phoenix, Arizona; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden
Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin,
Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio;
Beaumont, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue,
Washington; New York, New York; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and
the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on Regulation of
Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and
statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Village Board
finds that:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary and
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled
by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently
no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
§ 9.34.010 CODE ADOPTION § 9.35.010
1.01:229
2. Employees of certain sexually oriented businesses, defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher
incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees
of other establishments. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1.01, Code Adoption)]
3. Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented business, especially those which provide private
or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live
sex shows.
4. Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
5. Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
6. At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited
to syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A and Non B,
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
7. Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by the HIV virus in the United
States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985,
and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
8. The State of Wisconsin Division of Health indicated that on July 25,
1986, there were 96 cases of AIDS reported in the state, including
54 cases that resulted in death and that a ten-fold increase in
reported cases was expected between 1986 and 1991.
9. The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases
reported in 1982, and 45,200 through November 1990.
10. The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over 1/2 million cases being
reported in 1990.
11. In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the
United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV
infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous
drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components and
from an infected mother to her newborn.
12. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
§ 9.35.010 GRAFTON CODE § 9.35.010
1.01:230
13. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy, and in part because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the
facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those
facilities.
14. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is
found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons
view adult-oriented films.
15. Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related
crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where
sexually oriented businesses are located.
16. Studies of the relationship between sexually oriented business and
neighborhood property values have found a negative impact on
both residential and commercial property values.
17. There is an increase in the potential for infiltration by organized
crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct.
18. The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of sexually
oriented businesses exacerbated the deleterious secondary effects
of such businesses on the community. In fact, the Supreme Court
has gone so far as to assert that "common sense indicates that any
form of nudity coupled with alcohol begets undesirable behavior."
Ben's Bar, 2003 WI 132541.
19. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the
substantial government concerns addressed in the above
subsections.
20. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see
that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent
with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as
well as the citizens of the Village. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
21. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of
such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.

such conduct.
23. The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the

premises a chronic nuisance premises. The Chief of Police or his/her
designee shall provide written notice of his or her determination to the
premises owner identified by the Village Assessor's records for that
premises. The chronic nuisance premises notice ("CNP notice") shall be
deemed delivered if sent either by first class mail to the premises
owner's last known address or delivered in person to the premises
owner. If the premises owner cannot be located, the notice shall be
deemed to be properly delivered if a copy of it is left at the premises
owner's usual place of abode in the presence of some competent
member of the family at least 14 years of age or a competent adult
currently residing there and who shall be informed of the contents of
the CNP notice. If a current address cannot be located, it shall be
deemed sufficient if a copy of the CNP notice is sent by first class mail
to the last known address of the owner as identified by the records of
the Village Assessor.
B. The CNP notice shall contain the following information:
1. Street address, parcel number or a legal description sufficient to
identify the premises.
2. A concise statement, including a description of the relevant
activities supporting the determination that the premises is a
chronic nuisance premises.

Police or his/her designee of any change in address to ensure
receipt of future notices.

either with an appeal or to propose a written course of action to
abate the nuisance activities. The statement shall direct the
premises owner to schedule a meeting with the Chief of Police or
his/her designee and/or Building Inspector or his/her designee to
discuss the nuisance activity and the premises owner's intent
regarding abatement.

6. A statement that the premises' owner may be subject to a forfeiture
action with a penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000
per day for permitting a chronic nuisance premises and may be
subject to imprisonment for failure to pay such forfeiture.
C. In reaching a determination that a premises is a chronic nuisance
premises, activities that were reported to the police by the premises
owner or on-site premises manager shall not be included as nuisance
activities.
D. Section 968.075, Wis. Stats., broadly defines "domestic abuse."
Therefore, in reaching a determination that a premises is a chronic
nuisance premises, activities that are "domestic abuse" incidents
pursuant to § 968.075, Wis. Stats., shall not be included as nuisance
activities unless the incidents have been reviewed by the Chief of Police
or his/her designee and the Village Attorney and a determination is
made that, based upon the specific facts of each incident, the activities
should be deemed nuisance activities as identified under the definition
of "nuisance activities" in § 9.47.020. In determining whether to include
such activities, the Chief of Police or his/her designee and Village
Attorney shall consider the strong public policy in favor of domestic
victims reporting alleged abuses.
E. If the owner responds to the CNP notice pursuant to Subsection B.5 of
this section with a nuisance abatement proposal, the Chief of Police or
his/her designee may accept, reject or work with the owner to modify
the proposal. The plan is acceptable if it can reasonably be expected to
result in abatement of the nuisance activities described in the CNP
notice within 60 days.
F. Premises owners and operators shall be consulted if possible regarding
nuisance abatement methods and strategies and shall be encouraged to
submit a comprehensive nuisance abatement plan.
G. Premises owners and operators shall be consulted if possible regarding
use of available resources, including community service providers,
when nuisance activity associated with the premises is not caused or
contributed to by the direct actions of a tenant.
H. If the premises owner or operator meets with the Chief of Police or his/
her designee and presents an acceptable abatement plan and initiates
action to abate the nuisance activities occurring on the premises, the
Police Department may delay further enforcement of this chapter.
I. If the premises owner or operator ceases to cooperate with the efforts
to abate the nuisance activities, the Chief of Police or his/her designee
will reinstitute enforcement of this chapter, and the premises owner will
be sent a change-in-status letter. This letter will document Police
Department efforts to contact and/or obtain cooperation of the owner or
operator.

whenever the Chief of Police or his/her designee determines that any of
the following have occurred:
1. A premises owner has failed to respond to the CNP notice in
Subsection A; or

abate this and any subsequent nuisance activities and refer such cost to
the Village Director of Administrative Services so that the cost may be
billed to the premises owner. The Chief of Police or his/her designee
shall notify the premises owner of the decision to refer the cost of
enforcement to the Village Director of Administrative Services. Delivery
of this notice, along with a copy of the Chief's referral letter to the
Village Director of Administrative Services, shall be made as set forth in

premises may be submitted in writing to the Board of Appeals as an
administrative decision under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats.
§ 9.47.060. Eviction or retaliation prohibited.
Chief of Police or his/her designee, issued pursuant to § 9.47.030L, the
Village Director of Administrative Services shall charge any premises
owner found to be in violation of this chapter the costs of enforcement,
in full or in part. Such costs shall be billed to the premises owner by
invoice sent by regular mail and must be paid within 30 days of the
date on the invoice. Any unpaid invoice shall be a lien on such premises
and may be assessed and collected as a special charge pursuant to
§ 66.0627, Wis. Stats. A one-hundred-dollar administrative fee shall be
added to the cost of enforcement charged to the benefited premises any
time the premises is declared a chronic nuisance premises.
B. Suspension of cost recovery. If after the receipt of a billing notice from
the Village Director of Administrative Services the premises owner
develops an acceptable plan and initiates action to abate nuisance
activities occurring on the premises, the Chief of Police or his/her
designee will suspend further enforcement of this chapter. The
premises owner is still responsible for any enforcement costs incurred
prior to the premises owner submitting an abatement plan, including

enforcement action. Upon default of payment, the premises owner may
be imprisoned in the county jail for a period of not more than 90 days.

landlord to intimidate or actively discourage a tenant and/or persons
associated with a tenant from calling the police to report nuisance

the operation of this chapter.

contributes to blight, deterioration to surrounding properties, and reduces
the attractive physical qualities of neighborhoods, all to the detriment of
the Village; constitutes a public nuisance and must be abated promptly to

to remove the said graffiti and assess costs to the property tax roll.
A. Purpose and intent. To provide for the implementation and use of digital
security imaging systems (DSIS) that monitor the exterior and interior
spaces and areas of certain commercial establishments. The DSIS will
afford the opportunity for public safety departments (e.g., Police and
Fire Department) to visually examine certain commercial
establishments and will provide emergency response personnel with a
visual assessment of an emergency situation in advance of arrival. The
advanced visual assessment may pertain to a person(s) (personal
identification), a location (scene identification), and/or a situation

1. While it is anticipated that the implementation and usage of DSIS

§ 9.67.010. Purpose and findings.
This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and
safety of children in Grafton from the risk that certain convicted sex
offenders may re-offend in locations close to their residences. The Village
finds and declares that certain sex offenders are a serious threat to public
safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more
likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or
sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that
reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of
re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or
play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law
near schools and day-care centers. The Village finds and declares that, in
addition to schools and day-care centers, children congregate or play at
public parks, swimming pools, libraries, recreational trails, athletic fields,
and playgrounds.

same to be so maintained for a period of one year. In refilling the opening,
the earth must be puddled or laid in layers not more than nine inches in
depth and each layer rammed or tamped to prevent after-settling. When
sides of the trench will not stand perpendicular, sheathing and braces must
be used to prevent caving. The Village may elect to have the Department of

in which case the cost of making such repair and of maintaining it for one
year shall be charged to the person making the street opening.

extended on a customer-financed basis as hereinafter provided.
C. Customer-financed water main extensions.
1. Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:
CONTRIBUTOR  The owner of property at time of a contribution
or refund unless otherwise specified by written agreement.
CUSTOMER  As used in this rule means the owner of premises
to which water is or is to be furnished unless specific written
agreements specify otherwise. The customer at all times means the
property owner at the time a contribution is to be made or a refund
becomes available.
2. Basis for determining contributions from original customer. The
applicant or applicants will advance the amount that would have
been assessed under Subsection C.1 of this section. The
contribution must be paid in advance of construction.
3. Additional customers and refunds. When additional customers are
connected to a water main that was originally financed in part by
customers, the Utility will require a contribution from each new
customer equal to the existing average contribution. When the
amount of customer contribution computed under Subsection C.2
of this section is less than would have been assessed under
Subsection C.1 of this section, the applicant for service shall pay an
amount equivalent to the assessment. This amount shall then be
refunded pro rata to all contributors along the extension whose
remaining contribution still exceeds what would have been
assessed under Subsection C.1 of this section.
When refunds have reduced the contribution of any contributor
to the applicable assessment per front foot, no further refund will
be made to that individual. After all refunds have been made, the
remaining premises that may connect will be charged at the rate
per front foot established for the extension.
4. Limit of extension. When an extension beyond an existing extension
is required to serve a new customer, and the cost of a customer
exceeds the average remaining contribution in the original
extension, then the new extension will be considered as an entirely
new project, without refunds or other connection with the original
extension.
D. Connection to Utility-financed mains or loops. When customers connect
to a transmission main or connecting loop laid at Utility expense, there
shall be assessed against the property of said customer on a front-foot
basis an amount equal to the average front-foot assessment in the area.

rental charge set by the Water Utility to compensate for the cost of
furnishing and servicing the meter. The rental charge shall be billed at
the time the sewer service charge is billed.
C. Deduct meters. If a person feels that a significant amount of metered
water does not reach the sanitary sewer, he can at his own expense,
with approval of the approving authority, install such additional meters
or metered services as are necessary to calculate the volume of water
not discharged to the sanitary sewer. Metered water not discharged to
the sanitary sewers shall not be subject to sewer service charges.
Requests to install additional meters must be made in writing to the
approving authority.
A. General sewer service. Metered.
1. Quarterly service charge. This is a fixed quarterly charge that
applies on a meter size basis to all metered customers discharging
domestic strength sewage up to 200 mg/l per liter BOD, 250 mg/l
per liter suspended solids, 6 mg/l per liter for phosphorus and 20
mg/l per liter for nitrogen.
2. Volume charge. A volume charge applies for each 1,000 gallons
domestic strength sewage discharged to the sanitary sewer
system.21
B. High strength sewer service, metered. Where the strength of any
contributor exceeds the strength limitations of 200 milligrams per liter
for BOD, 250 milligrams per liter for suspended solids, six milligrams
per liter for phosphorus and 20 milligrams per liter for nitrogen, a
periodic sampling shall be taken and wastewater analyzed to determine
the strength of said waste which will be billed at the high strength rates
currently in effect. [Amended by Ord. No. 035 Series 2002; Ord.
No. 008, Series 2003]
C. Reassignment of sewer users. The approving authority will reassign

PUBLIC AREAS
§ 18.24.010. Purpose.
In order that adequate public lands and open space sites may be properly
located and preserved as the Village of Grafton develops, the following
provisions are established.
§ 18.24.020. Public sites and open spaces.
A. Dedication of lands. Whenever any subdivision, or certified survey map
is certified, signed, acknowledged, and recorded as prescribed in
§ 236.29, Wis. Stats., or a condominium under the provisions prescribed
in Ch. 703, Wis. Stats., every donation of land to the public intended for
the streets, alleys, ways, commons or other public uses as designated
on said subdivision, certified survey map, or condominium shall be
deemed sufficient conveyance to vest the fee simple title with the
Village of Grafton for the public benefit.
B. Suitability of land for public use. Whenever a certified survey map,
subdivision plat, condominium, or multiple-family dwelling
development includes a proposed dedication of land to public use and it
is found that such land is not required or not suitable for public use, the
Plan Commission may recommend to the Village Board to either refuse
to approve such dedication or require the rearrangement of lots in the
proposed certified survey map, subdivision plat, condominium, or
multiple-family dwelling development.
1. The location and suitability of all land to be dedicated are subject to
review and final acceptance by the Village.
2. Lands unsuitable for residential development or conventional
construction methods may be dedicated to fulfill required
obligations only upon written approval by the Village Board.
C. Size of land for public use. The area of each parcel of land proposed as a
dedication of land for public use shall be of such minimum dimensions,
as determined by the Plan Commission, so as to be functionally usable.
D. Location. Whenever a certified survey map, subdivision plat,
condominium, or multiple-family dwelling development includes a
proposed dedication of land to public use, said dedicated land shall be
located and sited with sensitivity to surrounding development and
existing and planned land uses.
E. Drainageways, stormwater detention and retention basins and other
public ways or public access to navigable lakes or streams.
1. Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided as a subdivision, divided
by a certified survey map, or developed as a condominium includes
lands designated to be owned by the public, to include
drainageways, stormwater detention and retention basins, and
§ 18.20.280 CODE ADOPTION § 18.24.020
1.01:429
other public ways or public access to navigable lakes or streams
which have been designated or graphically delineated on the
adopted County Development Plan, and/or local comprehensive
plans or adopted plan components, or as required by the State
of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under § 236.16(3),
Wis. Stats., or required by the Village of Grafton or the appropriate
municipality, said public way shall be made a part of the subdivision
plat, certified survey map, or condominium and dedicated by the
subdivider or condominium developer in the location and
dimensions indicated on said plan or map and as set forth in this
title.
2. Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided as a subdivision, divided
by a certified survey map, developed as a condominium, or
developed as a commercial/retail use, there shall be land (outlot)
designated for stormwater quality, which could comprise of a
detention and/or retention basin. These water quality ponds or
devices shall remain private, and the developer shall create an
association through which all property owners will own a share of
the outlot, and this association shall be responsible for the
maintenance. The developer shall grant the Village a stormwater
easement and enter into an agreement that requires the formation
of an association for continual maintenance of these ponds/devices;
the Village shall have the right to do the maintenance and assess
these costs to the association. [Amended by Ord. No. 004, Series
2005]
3. Subdivisions or certified survey maps abutting on a navigable lake
or stream shall, according to the provisions of § 236.16(3), Wis.
Stats., provide access at least 60 feet wide to the low-water mark so
that there will be public access which is connected to existing
public roads at least at one-half-mile intervals as measured along
the lake or stream shore, except where greater intervals and wider
access is approved, and excluding shore areas where public parks
or open space and streets or roads on either side of a stream are
provided. Such access shall be dedicated to the Village of Grafton.
F. Parks or playgrounds. Whenever a tract of land to be divided by either
certified survey map or subdivision plat or developed as a condominium
within the jurisdiction of this title encompasses all or any part of a park
or playground that has been designated on a duly adopted Village of
Grafton, county or regional comprehensive plan or comprehensive plan
component pursuant to § 62.23(6), Wis. Stats., said park or playground
shall be made a part of that certified survey map, subdivision plat, or
condominium and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider or
condominium developer in the locations and dimensions indicated on
said plan and according to the procedures set forth in this section.
G. Substitution of private recreation and open space lands for required
public recreational and open space land reservations or dedications not
permitted. The substitution of private recreation and open space lands
§ 18.24.020 GRAFTON CODE § 18.24.020
1.01:430
for required public recreational and open space land reservations or
dedications under this title shall not be permitted.
H. Reservation and/or dedication of suitable sites of adequate area for
future schools, parks, playgrounds, drainageways, and other public
purposes. In the design of a subdivision plat, certified survey map,
condominium, or multiple-family dwelling development zoned for
residential uses, due consideration shall be given to the reservation
and/or dedication of suitable sites of adequate area for future schools,
parks, playgrounds, drainageways, and other public purposes.
1. Provision of public park areas (not including drainageways,
schools, and lands for other public purposes) shall be based upon
the per capita standards (i.e., the type of park area needed per
1,000 persons served) set forth in the adopted Village of Grafton
Comprehensive Plan, or elements thereof (including the Village of
Grafton Park and Open Space Plan), as follows:
Community Park:
For park site = 2.2 acres per 1,000
persons
For playfield and playground
associated with park site
= 0.9 acre per 1,000 persons
Neighborhood Park:
For park site = 1.7 acres per 1,000
persons
For playfield and playground
associated with park site
= 1.6 acres per 1,000
persons
Subneighborhood Park:
Playground = 0.35 acres per 1,000
persons
Playfield = 0.39 acres per 1,000
persons
Vest Pocket Park:
Playground = 0.35 acres per 1,000
persons
Total public outdoor recreation
land dedication required
= 7.49 acres per 1,000
persons
§ 18.24.020 CODE ADOPTION § 18.24.020
1.01:431
The determination of the persons per household or dwelling unit
shall be based upon the average number of persons per household
as reported in the most recent U.S. Census for the Village of
Grafton, Wisconsin. (Note: In 1990, there were 2.74 persons per
household in the Village of Grafton.) Based upon these adopted
Village Comprehensive Plan standards, the amount of land to be
dedicated for public outdoor recreation lands, including public
parks and playgrounds, shall be according to those rates set forth
in Subsection K of this section.
2. If designated on the county development plan, Village
Comprehensive Plan or plan component, Official Map, or
component neighborhood or subarea development plan, such park
areas shall be made a part of the certified survey map, subdivision
plat, condominium, or multiple-family dwelling development as
stipulated in this section.
3. If not so designated, consideration shall be given in the location of
such sites to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, young or
mature woodlands, wetlands, lakes and ponds, watercourses,
watersheds, drainageways, steep slopes, and ravines.
I. Selection of options. The Plan Commission shall, at the time of
reviewing the certified survey map, preliminary plat, condominium, or
multiple-family dwelling development, recommend to the Village Board
one of the following options and record such recommendation in the
minutes of the meeting at which the certified survey map, preliminary
plat, condominium, or multiple-family dwelling development is
presented for approval. The Village Board, at the time of reviewing the
certified survey map, preliminary plat, condominium, or multiple-family
dwelling development and after reviewing the recommendation of the
Plan Commission, selects one the following options and records such
selection in the minutes of the meeting at which the certified survey
map, preliminary plat, condominium, or multiple-family dwelling
development is presented for approval:
1. Dedicate open space lands designated on the county development
plans, Village Comprehensive Plan or plan component; or
2. Reserve such open space lands and pay a public outdoor recreation
land site fee in conformance with Chapter 3.44, Impact Fees, of the
Code, as established pursuant to the requirements of § 66.0617,
Wis. Stats., as amended; or
3. Where no open space lands are directly involved, pay a public
outdoor recreation land site fee in conformance with Chapter 3.44,
Impact Fees, of the Code, as established pursuant to the
requirements of § 66.0617, Wis. Stats. as amended.
J. Exemptions. Subject to the requirements and provisions of Chapter
3.44, Impact Fees, of the Code, established pursuant to the
§ 18.24.020 GRAFTON CODE § 18.24.020
1.01:432
requirements of § 66.0617, Wis. Stats., as amended, where a lot, parcel
or dwelling unit for which dedication or fee in lieu of dedication has
once been paid is further divided or additional dwelling units created,
dedication or payment in lieu of dedication shall be required only for
the additional lots, parcels or dwelling units created. No lot or dwelling
unit which is fully developed for residential purposes at the time of
the creation of the subdivision, certified survey map, condominium, or
multiple-family dwelling development shall be required to pay a public
outdoor recreation land site fee. Lots or parcels designated as "outlots,"
as defined by this title, shall not be counted as lots or parcels for which
a land dedication is required or to provide a fee in lieu of dedication.
Lots or parcels designated as "outlots" may, however, be dedicated
or reserved as public sites as long as their intended public use is so
designated on the face of the subdivision plat, certified survey map,
condominium, or multiple-family dwelling development.
K. Dedication of site option.
1. Determination of the amount of land to be dedicated. Whenever a
proposed playground, park, or other public open space land
designated on the county's development plan, Village's
Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood unit development or subarea
plan, or other Comprehensive Plan component is encompassed, all
or in part, within a tract of land to be divided by either a certified
survey map or subdivision plat or is a part of a condominium or
multiple-family dwelling development, the public lands shall be
made a part of the certified survey map, preliminary plat,
condominium, or multiple-family dwelling development and shall
be dedicated to the public by the subdivider or condominium
developer at the following rates for the provision of the following
public outdoor recreation lands:
Community Park:
For park site = 0.006028 acre per dwelling
unit
For playfield and playground
associated with park site
= 0.002466 acre per dwelling
unit
Neighborhood park:
For park site = 0.004658 acre per dwelling
unit
For playfield and playground
associated with park site

3. These maps and profiles, respectively, are the Official Floodplain
Zoning Maps and profiles. These maps are on file in the office of the
Zoning Administrator.
C. Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided
into four districts, as follows:
1. The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to
carry the regional floodwaters.
2. The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain
between the regional flood limits and the floodway.
3. The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been
or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
4. The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain
where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional
flood discharge.
D. Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map, and actual field conditions shall be
resolved using the criteria in Subsection D(1) or (2) below. If a
significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to
§ 21.04.050 CODE ADOPTION § 21.04.050
1.01:473
§ 21.04.280. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether
or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall
be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions
and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for
initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes
between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district
boundary line shall be settled according to § 21.04.240C and the
criteria in Subsection D(1) and (2) below.
1. If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
2. Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall
be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any
information provided by the Department.
E. Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain
unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood
elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the
map is amended pursuant to § 21.04.280.
F. Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this
chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other
applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
G. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways
and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt
when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
H. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter supersedes all the
provisions of any municipal zoning chapter enacted under § 61.35 or
87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another chapter is
more restrictive than this chapter, that chapter shall continue in full
force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not
otherwise. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair
any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
I. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor
of the Village Board and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall
be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the
§ 21.04.050 GRAFTON CODE § 21.04.050
1.01:474
§ 21.04.060. General standards applicable to all floodplain districts;
hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
Except as allowed in Subsection C below, no floodplain development shall:
adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text
amendment to this chapter.
J. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in
this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific
research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased
by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or
guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be
free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create
liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the Village of
Grafton or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
may result from reliance on this chapter.
K. Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.
L. Annexed areas. The Ozaukee County floodplain zoning provisions in
effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be
enforced by the Village of Grafton for all annexed areas until the Village
of Grafton adopts and enforces a chapter which meets the requirements
of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the Village of
Grafton's Official Zoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section
and are on file in the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator. All
plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and
the location of the floodway.
M. General development standards. The community shall review all permit
applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a floodprone
area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be
designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices
that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and
other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance
with the above standards. All subdivision proposals shall include
regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that
meets the subdivision definition of this chapter.

No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain
shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent
municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices and required
the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The floodcarrying
capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be
maintained. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the
date of the watercourse alteration or relocation, the Zoning Administrator
shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting appropriate technical or
scientific data in accordance with NFIP guidelines that shall be used to
revise the FIRM, risk premium rates and floodplain management
regulations as required.

flood hazard area and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood
will not damage existing or proposed buildings.
REGIONAL FLOOD  A flood determined to be representative of large
floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with
a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if
depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180

particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict
conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or
density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes
of the chapter.

by reference. The shoreland-wetland provisions adopted shall apply to all
properties annexed to the Village of Grafton after May 7, 1982.
§ 22.04.020. Finding of fact and purpose.
Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable
waters of the Village would adversely affect the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature
of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
§ 22.04.030. General provisions. [Amended 2-1-2016 by Ord. No.
002-2016]
A. Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;

C. Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter
or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that
would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
D. Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by
preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
E. Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
F. Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of
natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation,
filling and other earthmoving activities.
A. Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within
the shoreland area of the Village shall be in full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federal
regulations. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a
zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of
this chapter.
B. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the Village and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this
chapter is required by a standard in Ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where
the ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light
of the Ch. NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the
ordinance codified in this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent
text amendment to this chapter.

A. This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under § 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which
relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands; except that, where
another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this
chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the
extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
B. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter
shall prevail.
C. The lands within the Shoreland Zoning District are subject to all
applicable provisions of the Village of Grafton Municipal Code. Where
the provisions of this chapter are more restrictive than other
regulations in the Code, the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
A. The Ozaukee County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date
of annexation remain in effect and administered by the Village for all
areas annexed by the Village after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands
are described on the Village Official Zoning Map. The Ozaukee County
shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
Village Zoning Administrator.

district boundary shown on the Official Zoning Maps and actual field
conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning
Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the
Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as
mapped is in error. If Department staff concur with the Zoning
Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as
wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to
immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the
regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct
wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands
designated in §§ 22.04.100 and 22.110, the Zoning Administrator shall
be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable
period.

of an ordinance previously enacted under § 61.35, Wis. Stats., that
relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise
specified in § 61.354, Wis. Stats., § 61.35, Wis. Stats., applies to this
chapter and to any amendments to this chapter.
B. The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful
regulatory powers of the same governing body.
C. The Village Board hereby designates the Director of Public Works/
Village Engineer and the Building Inspector to administer and enforce
the provisions of this chapter.
D. The requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent
stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of
the following:
1. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals, including those authorized under §§ 281.16
and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
2. Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in
rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under
§ NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
A. The Village Board finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has
a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and
general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment
and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled postconstruction
runoff can:
1. Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank
erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater
recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream
temperature.
2. Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic
life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant
loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals,
bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
3. Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads.
4. Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
5. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage
facilities.
6. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
increasing major flood peaks and volumes.

7. Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the
incidence and levels of flooding.
A. Purpose. The general purpose of this chapter is to establish long-term,
post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic
environment. Specific purposes are to:
1. Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
2. Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites,
placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and
scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
3. Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage
facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel
erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of
particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger
downstream property.
4. Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate
storm sewer to protect the waters of the state.
B. Intent. It is the intent of the Village Board that this chapter regulates
post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This
chapter may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Village Board
recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the
stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is through
the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level
stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as
watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may
prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of
which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to
discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance
with the performance standards developed under § 281.16, Wis. Stats.,
for regional stormwater management measures and have been
approved by the Village Board, it is the intent of this chapter that the
approved plan be used to identify post-construction management
measures acceptable for the community.
A. Applicability.
1. Where not otherwise limited by law, this chapter applies after final
stabilization to a site of land-disturbing construction activity
meeting any of the criteria in this paragraph, unless the site is
otherwise exempt under Subsection A.2. A post-development

2. A site that meets any of the criteria in this subsection is exempt
from the requirements of this chapter:
a. A redevelopment post-construction site with no increase in
exposed parking lots or roads.
b. A post-construction site with less than 10% connected
imperviousness based on complete development of the postconstruction
site, provided the cumulative area of all parking
lots and rooftops is less than one acre.

f. Underground utility construction such as water, sewer and
fiber-optic lines. This exemption does not apply to the
construction of any aboveground structures associated with
utility construction.
3. Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in Subsection A,
this chapter applies to post-construction sites of any size that, in
the opinion of the Director of Public Works/Village Engineer, is
likely to result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the
existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water; that causes
undue channel erosion; that increases water pollution by scouring
or the transportation of particulate matter; or that endangers
property or public safety.

§ 23.01.055. Applicability of maximum extent practicable.
Maximum extent practicable applies when a person who is subject to a
performance standard of this chapter demonstrates to the Department of
Public Work/Village Engineer's satisfaction that a performance standard is
not achievable and that a lower level of performance is appropriate. In
§ 23.01.050 GRAFTON CODE § 23.01.055
1.01:524
making the assertion that a performance standard is not achievable and
that a level of performance different from the performance standard is the
maximum extent practicable, the responsible party shall take into account
the best available technology, cost-effectiveness, geographic features, and
other competing interests such as protection of public safety and welfare,
protection of endangered and threatened resources, and preservation of
historic properties.
§ 23.01.060. Technical standards.
§ 23.01.070. Performance standards.
A. The following methods shall be used in designing the water quality,
peak flow shaving and infiltration components of stormwater practices
needed to meet the water quality standards of this chapter:
1. Technical standards identified, developed or disseminated by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under subchapter V of
Ch. NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code.
2. Where technical standards have not been identified or developed
by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, other technical
standards may be used, provided that the methods have been
approved by the Director of Public Works/Village Engineer.
3. In this chapter, the following year and location has been selected as
average annual rainfall: Milwaukee, 1969 (Mar. 28-Dec. 6).
A. Responsible party. The responsible party shall implement a postconstruction
stormwater management plan that incorporates the
requirements of this section.
B. Plan. A written stormwater management plan in accordance with
§ 23.01.090 shall be developed and implemented for each postconstruction
site.
C. Maintenance of effort. For redevelopment sites where the
redevelopment will be replacing older development that was subject to
post-construction performance standards of Ch. NR 151, Wis. Adm.
Code, in effect on or after October 1, 2004, the responsible party shall
meet the total suspended solids reduction, peak flow control,
infiltration, and protective areas standards applicable to the older
development or meet the redevelopment standards of this chapter,
whichever is more stringent.
D. Requirements. The plan required under Subsection B in this section
shall include the following:
1. Total suspended solids. BMPs shall be designed, installed and
maintained to control total suspended solids carried in runoff from
the post-construction site as follows:
§ 23.01.055 CODE ADOPTION § 23.01.070
1.01:525
a. For new development, by design, reduce to the maximum
extent practicable the total suspended solids load by 80%,
based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls. No person shall be required to exceed
an eighty-percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the
requirements of this subsection.
b. For redevelopment, by design, reduce to the maximum extent
practicable the total suspended solids load by 40%, based on
the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls. No person shall be required to exceed a
forty-percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the
requirements of this subsection.
c. For in-fill development under five acres that occurs within 10
years after the effective date of this rule (January 1, 2004), by
design, reduce to the maximum extent practicable the total
suspended solids load by 40%, based on an average annual
rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. No
person shall be required to exceed a forty-percent total
suspended solids reduction to meet the requirements of this
subsection.
d. For in-fill development that occurs 10 or more years after the
effective date of this rule (January 1, 2004), by design, reduce
to the maximum extent practicable the total suspended solids
load by 80%, based on an average annual rainfall, as compared
to no runoff management controls. No person shall be required
to exceed an eighty-percent total suspended solids reduction to
meet the requirements of this subsection.
e. Notwithstanding Subsection D.1.a to d, if the design cannot
achieve the applicable total suspended solids reduction
specified, the stormwater management plan shall include a
written and site-specific explanation why that level of
reduction is not attained, and the total suspended solids load
shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
f. Off-site drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the
BMP from off site shall be taken into account in determining
the treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the
efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing the size of
the BMP accordingly.
2. Peak discharge.
a. By design, BMPs shall be employed to maintain or reduce the
peak runoff discharge rates, to the maximum extent
practicable, as compared to predevelopment conditions for the
design storm referenced in Subsection D.2.c of this section
applicable to the post-construction site. Predevelopment
conditions shall assume "good hydrologic conditions" for
§ 23.01.070 GRAFTON CODE § 23.01.070
1.01:526
appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent
methodology. Peak discharges shall be calculated using TR-55
runoff curve number methodology, Atlas 14 precipitation
depths, and the NRCS Wisconsin MSE3 precipitation
distribution. On a case-by-case basis, the Director of Public
Works/Village Engineer may allow the use of TP-40
precipitation depths and the Type II distribution. The meaning
of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as
determined in TR-55. However, when predevelopment land
cover is cropland, rather than using TR-55 values for cropland,
the runoff curve numbers in Table 1 shall be used.
Table 1. Maximum Predevelopment Runoff Curve
Numbers
Hydrologic Soil Group
Runoff
Curve
Number A B C D
Woodland 30 55 70 77
Grassland 39 61 71 78
Cropland 55 69 78 83
b. This subsection of the ordinance does not apply to any of the
following:
1. A post-construction site where the change in hydrology
due to development does not increase the existing surface
water elevation at any point within the downstream
receiving water by more than 0.01 of a foot for the twoyear,
twenty-four-hour storm event.
2. A post-construction site where the discharge is directly
into a lake over 5,000 acres or a stream or river segment
draining more than 500 square miles.
3. A redevelopment post-construction site.
4. An in-fill development area less than five acres.
c. The post-construction peak discharge between a fifty-year
event and a hundred-year event shall be the predeveloped
twenty-five-year discharge. The post-construction peak
discharge between a ten-year event and a twenty-five-year
event shall be the predeveloped five-year event. The postconstruction
peak discharge between a two-year event and a
ten-year event shall be the predeveloped two-year event.
3. Infiltration. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained to
infiltrate runoff to the maximum extent practicable in accordance
§ 23.01.070 CODE ADOPTION § 23.01.070
1.01:527
with the following, except as provided in Subsection D.3.f and h
through j.
a. Low imperviousness. For development up to 40% connected
imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and low-density
residential development, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so
that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least
90% of the predevelopment infiltration volume, based on an
average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate
infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than 1%
of the post-construction site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
b. Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than
40% and up to 80% connected imperviousness, such as
medium- and high-density residential, multifamily
development, industrial and institutional development, and
office parks infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least 75% of the
predevelopment infiltration volume, based on an average
annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate
infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than 2%
of the post-construction site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
c. High imperviousness. For development with more than 80%
connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip malls,
shopping centers, and commercial downtowns, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least 60% of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to
meet this requirement, no more than 2% of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective infiltration area.
d. Predevelopment condition shall be the same as in Subsection
D.2, Peak discharge.
Note to permittees: A model that calculates runoff volume,
such as SLAMM, P8, or an equivalent methodology, may be
used.
e. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for
parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in
commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will enter an
infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to
protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled
maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance
with Subsection D.3.h. Pretreatment options may include, but
are not limited to, oil/grease separation, sedimentation,
biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips.
§ 23.01.070 GRAFTON CODE § 23.01.070
1.01:528
Note to permittees: To achieve the infiltration requirement
for the parking lots or roads, "maximum extent practicable"
should not be interpreted to require significant topography
changes that create an excessive financial burden. To
minimize potential groundwater impacts, it is desirable to
infiltrate the cleanest runoff. To achieve this, a design may
propose greater infiltration of runoff from low-pollutant
sources such as roofs, and less from higher-pollutant source
areas such as parking lots.
f. Exclusions. The runoff from the following areas are prohibited
from meeting the requirements of this subsection:
1. Areas associated with Tier 1 industrial facilities identified
in § NR 216.21(2)(a), Wis. Adm. Code, including storage,
loading, rooftop and parking.
2. Storage and loading areas of Tier 2 industrial facilities
identified in § NR 216.21(2)(b), Wis. Adm. Code.
Note to permittees: Runoff from Tier 2 parking and
rooftop areas may be infiltrated but may require
pretreatment.
3. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas.
4. Areas within 1,000 feet upgradient or within 100 feet
downgradient of karst features.
5. Areas with less than three-feet separation distance from
the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of
seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock, except
this Subsection D.3.f.5 does not prohibit infiltration of roof
runoff.
6. Areas with runoff from industrial, commercial and
institutional parking lots and roads and residential arterial
roads with less than five-feet separation distance from the
bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of
seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock.
7. Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as
specified in § NR 811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code, or within 100
feet of a private well as specified in § NR 812.08(4), Wis.
Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial,
industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices
for residential development.
8. Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in § NR
720.03(2), Wis. Adm. Code, are present in the soil through
which infiltration will occur.
§ 23.01.070 CODE ADOPTION § 23.01.070
1.01:529
9. Any area where the soil does not exhibit one of the
following soil characteristics between the bottom of the
infiltration system and the seasonal high groundwater and
top of bedrock: at least a three-foot soil layer with twentypercent
fines or greater; or at least a five-foot soil layer
with ten-percent fines or greater. This does not apply
where the soil medium within the infiltration system
provides an equivalent level of protection. This Subsection
D.3.f.9 does not prohibit infiltration of roof runoff.
Note to permittees: The areas listed in Subsection D.3.f,
Exclusions, are prohibited from infiltrating runoff due to
the potential for groundwater contamination.
g. Separation distances.
1. Infiltration practices shall be located so that the
characteristics of the soil and the separation distance
between the bottom of the infiltration system and the
elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of
bedrock are in accordance with Table 3:

frozen.
6. Roads in commercial, industrial and institutional land
uses, and arterial residential roads.
i. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet
flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be
given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by
this paragraph.
j. Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this
paragraph shall:
1. To the extent technically and economically feasible,
minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater
and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action
limit at a point of standards application in accordance with
Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site-specific
information indicates that compliance with a preventive
action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not
be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to
the maximum extent practicable.
2. Notwithstanding Subsection D.3.j.1, the discharge from
BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the
point of standards application.
4. Protective areas.
a. "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the
top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the
delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the
following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the
channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest
impervious surface. However, in this paragraph, "protective
area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream
enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter
the enclosure at this location.
§ 23.01.070 CODE ADOPTION § 23.01.070
1.01:531
1. For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource
waters, and for wetlands in areas of special natural
resource interest as specified in § NR 103.04, Wis. Adm.
Code: 75 feet.
2. For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a
United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute series
topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever
is more current: 50 feet.
3. For lakes: 50 feet.
4. For wetlands not subject to Subsection D.4.a.5 or 6: 50
feet.
5. For highly susceptible wetlands: 75 feet. Highly
susceptible wetlands include the following types: fens,
sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, shrub
swamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows,
shallow marshes, deep marshes and seasonally flooded
basins. Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in
accordance with § NR 103.08(lm), Wis. Adm. Code. This
paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have been
completely filled in accordance with all applicable state
and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands
that have been partially filled in accordance with all
applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured
from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been
placed.
6. For less susceptible wetlands: 10% of the average wetland
width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet. Less
susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands
dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass;
cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits or dredged
material or fill material disposal sites that take on the
attributes of a wetland.
7. In Subsection D.4.a.1, 4, 5 and 6, determinations of the
extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be
made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff
susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the
standards and criteria in § NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
8. For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas
greater than 130 acres: 10 feet.
9. Notwithstanding Subsection D.4.a.1 to 8, the greatest
protective area width shall apply where rivers, streams,
lakes and wetlands are contiguous.
§ 23.01.070 GRAFTON CODE § 23.01.070
1.01:532
b. This paragraph applies to post-construction sites located
within a protective area, except those areas exempted
pursuant to Subsection D.4.d of this section.
c. The following requirements shall be met:
1. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective
area to the maximum extent practicable. The stormwater
management plan shall contain a written site-specific
explanation for any parts of the protective area that are
disturbed during construction.
2. Where land-disturbing construction activity occurs within
a protective area, and where no impervious surface is
present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover
of 70% or greater shall be established and maintained. The
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish
habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland
flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative
materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the
bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep
slopes or where high velocity flows occur.
Note to permittees: It is recommended that seeding of
nonaggressive vegetative cover be used in the protective
areas. Vegetation that is flood- and drought-tolerant and
can provide long-term bank stability because of an
extensive root system is preferable. Vegetative cover can
be measured using the line transect method described
in the University of Wisconsin Extension Publication
Number A3533, titled "Estimating Residue Using the Line
Transect Method."
3. Best management practices such as filter strips, swales or
wet detention basins, that are designed to control
pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the
protective area.
Note to Permittees: Other regulations, such as Ch. 30,
Wis. Stats., and Chs. NR 103, 115, 116 and 117, Wis. Adm.
Code, and their associated review and approval process,
may apply in the protective area.
d. This paragraph does not apply to:
1. Redevelopment post-construction sites.
2. In-fill development areas less than five acres.
3. Structures that cross or access surface waters such as
boat landings, bridges and culverts.
§ 23.01.070 CODE ADOPTION § 23.01.070
1.01:533
4. Structures constructed in accordance with § 59.692(lv),
Wis. Stats.
5. Post-construction sites from which runoff does not enter
the surface water, except to the extent that vegetative
ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
Note to permittees: A vegetated protective area to filter
runoff pollutants from post-construction sites described in
Subsection D.4.d.5 above, is not necessary since runoff
is not entering the surface water at that location. Other
practices, necessary to meet the requirements of this
section, such as a swale or basin, will need to be designed
and implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the
runoff enters a surface water of the state.
5. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle
maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have
BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum
within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state
contains no visible petroleum sheen.
Note to permittees: A combination of the following BMPs may be
used: oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup
materials, or any other structural or nonstructural method of
preventing or treating petroleum in runoff.
6. Swale treatment for transportation facilities.
a. Applicability. Except as provided in Subsection D.6.b,
transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance
and pollutant removal meet all of the requirements of this
section, if the swales are designed to the maximum extent
practicable to do all of the following:
1. Be vegetated. However, where appropriate, nonvegetative
measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide
for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization or
check dams.
Note to permittees: It is preferred that tall and dense
vegetation be maintained within the swale due to its
greater effectiveness at enhancing runoff pollutant
removal.
2. Swales shall comply with sections V.F. (Velocity and Depth)
and V.G. (Sale Geometry Criteria) with a swale treatment
length as long as that specified in section V.C.
(preTreatment) of the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources Technical Standard 1005 "Vegetated Infiltration
Swales," dated May 2007, or a superseding document.
§ 23.01.070 GRAFTON CODE § 23.01.070
1.01:534
Transportation facility swale treatment does not have to
comply with other sections of Technical Standard 1005.
Note to permittees: Check dams may be included in the
swale design to slow runoff flows and improve pollutant
removal. Transportation facilities with continuous
features such as curb and gutter, sidewalks or parking
lanes do not comply with the design requirements of this
paragraph. However, a limited amount of structural
measures such as curb and gutter may be allowed as
necessary to account for other concerns such as human
safety or resource protection.
b. Exemptions. The Director of Public Works/Village Engineer
may, consistent with water quality standards, require other
provisions of this section be met on a transportation facility
with an average daily travel of vehicles greater than 2,500 and
where the initial surface water of the state that the runoff
directly enters is any of the following:
1. An outstanding resource water.
2. An exceptional resource water.
3. Waters listed in § 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act
that are identified as impaired in whole or in part due to
nonpoint source impacts.
4. Waters where targeted performance standards are
developed under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code, to meet
water quality standards.
5. The transportation facility authority shall contact the
Director of Public Works/Village Engineer to determine if
additional BMPs beyond a water quality swale are needed
under this subsection.
Note to permittees: The Department of Natural
Resource's regional stormwater staff can determine if
additional BMPs, beyond a water quality swale, are
needed under this paragraph.
E. General considerations for on-site and off-site stormwater management
measures. The following considerations shall be observed in managing
runoff:
1. Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales,
natural depressions, native soil-infiltrating capacity, and natural
groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the
extent possible, to meet the requirements of this section.
2. Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be
provided to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream

drainage facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream
property or public safety.
F. Location and regional treatment option.
1. The BMPs may be located on site or off site as part of a regional
stormwater device, practice or system, but shall be installed in
accordance with§ NR 151.003, Wis. Adm. Code.
2. Post-construction runoff within a non-navigable surface water that
flows into a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not required to
meet the performance standards of this chapter. Post-construction
BMPs may be located in non-navigable surface waters.
3. Except as allowed under Subsection F.4, post-construction runoff
from new development shall meet the post-construction
performance standards prior to entering a navigable surface water.
4. Post-construction runoff from any development within a navigable
surface water that flows into a BMP is not required to meet the
performance standards of this chapter, if:
a. The BMP was constructed prior to the effective date of this
chapter and the BMP either received a permit issued under Ch.
30, Wis. Stats., or the BMP did not require a Ch. 30, Wis. Stats.,
permit; and
b. The BMP is designed to provide runoff treatment from future
upland development.
5. Runoff from existing development, redevelopment and in-fill areas
shall meet the post-construction performance standards in
accordance with this paragraph.
a. To the maximum extent practicable, BMPs shall be located to
treat runoff prior to discharge to navigable surface waters.
b. Post-construction BMPs for such runoff may be located in a
navigable surface water if allowable under all other applicable
federal, state and local regulations such as Ch. NR 103, Wis.
Adm. Code, and Ch. 30, Wis. Stats.
Note to permittees: This allows the location of BMPs in
navigable surface waters where necessary to augment
management practices upstream of the navigable surface
water to meet the performance standards.
6. The discharge of runoff from a BMP, such as a wet detention pond,
or after a series of such BMPs is subject to this chapter.
Note to permittees: This section does not supersede any other
applicable federal, state or local regulation such as Ch. NR 103,
Wis. Adm. Code, and Ch. 30, Wis. Stats.

§ 23.04.020. Findings of fact.
The Village Board finds that runoff from land-disturbing construction
activity carries a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to the
waters of the state in the Village of Grafton.
§ 23.04.030. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to further the maintenance of safe and
healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; prevent and
control soil erosion; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control
building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground
cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth, by
minimizing the amount of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff or
discharged from land-disturbing construction activity to waters of the state
in the Village of Grafton.
§ 23.04.040. Applicability and jurisdiction.

SECTION 19.03.0102 ZONING DISTRICT MAPS
The location and boundaries of the districts established by this Ordinance are set forth in the Official Zoning Map,
dated April 3, 2000 and as amended, which is incorporated herein and hereby made a part of this Ordinance. The
Official Zoning Map, with everything shown thereon, and all amendments thereto, shall be as much a part of this
Ordinance as though fully set forth and described herein.
SECTION 19.03.0103 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
When uncertainty exists with respect to boundaries of the various districts shown on the zoning maps, the following
rules shall apply:
A. General Location of Zoning District Boundaries.
1. Zoning Boundary Determination. The zoning district boundaries are corporate limits; U.S.
Public Land Survey lines; lot or property lines; centerlines of street, highways, alleys, easements,
and railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended; or stream unless otherwise shown. Distances
not specifically shown on the Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the Zoning Map.
2. Zoning Boundary Determination for Approximate Boundaries. Where the designation of the
Official Zoning Map shows that various zoning districts are approximately bounded by a street,
alley, railroad, lot line, or stream, such lot line or the centerline of such street, alley, or railroad
right-of-way, or centerline of the main channel of such stream, said approximate boundaries shall
be construed to be the zoning district boundary line.
3. Split Zoning of Newly Created Lots Not Allowed. The split zoning of any newly created lot or
parcel into more than one (1) zoning district shall not be allowed except as may be permitted when
the HPO District; the FW, FF, and GFP Districts (under the provisions of Title 21 "Floodplain
Zoning of the Village of Grafton Municipal Code); and, the shoreland-wetland district (under the
provisions of Title 22 "Shoreland-Wetland Zoning of the Village of Grafton Municipal Code).
B. Zoning District Boundary Lines on Unsubdivided Property. In un-subdivided property, the location of
the zoning district boundary lines shown on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by using the scale
on such map or in the case of flood land boundaries shall be determined by using flood profiles and
accompanying hydrologic and hydraulic engineering data, or shall be according to the dimensions shown
on the map measured at right angles from the centerline of the street or highway, and the length of frontage
shall be according to dimensions shown on the map from section, quarter-section, or division lines, or
centerlines of streets, highways, or railroad rights-of-way unless otherwise shown.
SECTION 19.03.0104 ZONING OF STREETS, ALLEYS, PUBLIC-WAYS, WATERWAYS, AND
RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY
All streets, alleys, public-ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall
be deemed to be in the same zoning district as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, publicways,
waterways, and railroad rights-of-way. Where the centerline of a street, alley, public-way, waterway, or
railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.
SECTION 19.03.0105 ZONING OF ANNEXED LAND
Any additions to the incorporated area of the Village of Grafton, resulting from disconnections from incorporated
areas in Ozaukee County, annexations from unincorporated areas in Ozaukee County, or otherwise, shall be
automatically classified in the A-3 District on a temporary basis until otherwise classified by amendment. Upon
annexation, the existing use of the annexed property shall be considered a permitted use until permanent zoning is
established by the Village Board. All land annexed to the Village shall meet Village improvement standards as
determined by the Village Board.
19- 2
DIVISION 19.03.0200 RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
This Division sets forth detailed descriptions of the residential zoning districts and their respective dimensional and
bulk regulations, requirements, and design standards. The various "Open Space Subdivision" options indicated
within some residential zoning districts are "open space ratio," or OSR, driven. While the overall maximum gross
density stays essentially the same within each residential zoning district for each option within a specific residential
zoning district, as the minimum OSR increases the maximum permitted net density increases. Under the
"Conventional Subdivision" and other options presented for each residential zoning district, the site intensity and
capacity calculations, as well as the natural resource protection standards and guidelines set forth in Divisions
19.03.0500 and 19.04.0100 of this Ordinance, shall be followed. The residential zoning districts are generally
organized into a residential density hierarchy.
19- 3
SECTION 19.03.0201 R-RE RURAL ESTATE SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
A. District Intent. The R-RE District is intended to provide for rural estate type housing on very large lots as
set forth in the Village of Grafton Comprehensive Plan and components thereof. It preserves and enhances
the rural estate character of the district and surrounding areas and the attractiveness associated with such
areas. The R-RE District may also be used as a transitional district located between districts of higher and
lower intensity levels such as the A-3 and R-E Districts. For existing lots of record with existing dwelling
units located thereon and which lots of record and dwelling units are existing at the time of the adoption of
this Ordinance, the R-RE District is intended to be served by on-site soil absorption sewage disposal
systems, holding tanks, and/or private wells on an interim basis until such time as public sanitary sewer
service and/or public water supply facilities are made available. Any lots created in the R-RE District after
the adoption of this Ordinance shall be served by public sanitary sewer service and public water supply
facilities if available.
B. District Standards. The R-RE District is further intended to have the development standards as set forth
in Table 19.03.0201. Those developments served by on-site sewage disposal systems must meet all
requirements set forth under Section 19.02.0103(B)(3)(b) of this Ordinance.
C. Permitted, Accessory, and Conditional Uses. See Section 19.03.0602, Division 19.03.0700, Section
19.03.0702, and Section 19.03.0802 of this Ordinance.

DIVISION 19.03.0300 NONRESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
This Division sets forth detailed descriptions of the nonresidential zoning districts and their respective dimensional
and bulk regulations, requirements, and design standards. The nonresidential zoning districts are generally grouped
as follows: business districts, industrial districts, public and semi-public districts, agricultural districts, and special
districts.
SECTION 19.03.0301 CBD CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
A. DISTRICT INTENT. The CBD District is intended to provide for the continuation of the Village of
Grafton's traditional central business district and to ensure the compatibility of the diverse uses typical of
the "downtown" area without inhibiting the potential for maximum development of commercial, cultural,
entertainment, and other urban activities which contribute to its role as the "heart" of the Village. In
particular, these regulations are intended to preserve the historic buildings, the variety of building sizes and
heights, various architectural styles and unique detailing. The existing commercial activities are of a
general nature and have been characterized by on-street parking and loading and structures which abut the
street right-of-way or have small setbacks, While it is intended that the existing businesses be continued at
their present level of service, it is also intended that new buildings located in the CBD District--to the
extent possible--be required to provide for off-street parking and loading areas. The CBD District is
designed to prevent land and structures in the CBD District from becoming nonconforming as they would
be if placed under different, more suburban-oriented, zoning classifications. The CBD District also
provides for the minor infilling of vacant or redevelopment areas within the CBD District consistent with
the established character of the "downtown." It is not intended to create additional CBD Districts of this
type elsewhere in the community.
In general, the CBD Central Business District shall:
1. Be designed for walkable streets, while properly functioning for all traffic types.
2. Encourage pedestrian activities
3. Enhance user friendliness and safety for pedestrians.
4. Coordinate public streetscapes with private improvements.
5. Include buildings designed in individual or small groupings and shall be designed and sized in a
manner that is architecturally, aesthetically and operationally harmonious with the surrounding
area.
B. CONDITIONS OF USE.
Uses allowed in the CBD Central Business District are subject to the following conditions:
1. All business, servicing, processing, displays, and storage shall be conducted within completely
enclosed buildings, except for the following: outdoor dining, produce or flower markets, the sale
of gasoline, the sale of items of a seasonal nature including Christmas trees, bedding plants and
shall shrubs when authorized by a Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
2. Outdoor storage is permitted only when it is screened from view. The required screening may be
fencing, landscaping or walls and must be of sufficient height and density that the storage area is
screened from view from the ground level up to a point seven (7) feet above the ground level of
the adjoining street or property. No outside storage is permitted to rise above the screening.
3. Outdoor uses, including temporary uses, but not including storage areas, must be located wholly
on private property, shall not impede pedestrian or vehicle circulation, and shall not eliminate or
encroach upon required parking spaces unless the parking spaces are designated only for employee
parking. In addition, no more than three of the required on-site parking spaces may be used and
permits for off-site parking must be purchased prior to authorization of the outdoor use to replace
the lost spaces. The Director of Planning and Development may waive the requirement for
purchase of permits for off-site parking if documentation is submitted by the petitioner to
demonstrate that adequate on-site parking exists to meet the needs of the business.
19- 26
4. No manufacturing or assembling shall be permitted except as incidental to the business occupying
the premises.
5. A certificate of zoning compliance must be obtained consistent with the provisions of this Code
prior to any change of use, expansion of uses on a site and prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
6. The uses and development shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan 2035.
C. PERMITTED USES
Permitted uses in the CBD Central Business District are listed in Table 19.03.0301.B. If an applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of Planning and Development that a use that is not
specifically listed in the Table 19.03.0301.B.(the Use Matrix) is consistent with the intent of the zoning
district and is similar and compatible with the listed uses, the Director of Planning and Development may
allow the new use. The Director of Planning and Development shall document all such decisions in writing,
provide a copy of the decision to the Plan Commission for information and make a copy available for
public review upon request.
D. CONDITIONAL USES
Conditional uses may be allowed consistent with the provisions of SECTION 19.03.0703 DETAILED
STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS upon the granting of a
conditional use permit for the specific use. Conditional Uses in the CBD Central Business District are set
forth in Table 19.03.0301.B. (The Use Matrix).
E. DISTRICT STANDARDS.
The CBD District is further intended to have the development standards as set forth in Table 19.03.0301.A
below.

encourage additional pedestrian activity to enhance the commercial vitality of the area, small
spaces such as gardens and courtyards should be designed and incorporated into
developments whenever possible.
i. Retail uses should be located on the ground floor and residential uses above or below the
ground floor.
j. Landscaping and building design elements should be incorporated into development projects
adjacent to residential districts to create a transition from commercial to residential
development.
3. REVIEW OF PROPOSALS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE CBD CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
Review of development proposals for the CBD Central Business District shall be reviewed consistent with the
procedures for all properties and with the requirements for site plan review set forth in Chapter 19, Part Six

SECTION 19.03.0302 C-1 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT
A. District Intent. The C-1 District is intended to establish and preserve areas for commercial facilities for the
convenience of persons residing in nearby residential areas and is, thus, limited in its functions to
accommodating the basic day-to-day shopping and service needs of the residents living in the adjacent areas.
Buildings constructed in the C-1 District may be clustered on parcels of land under individual or multiple
ownership. The C-1 District provides for an arrangement of retail trade establishments that are compatible
in function and operation. The C-1 District is intended to be compatible with surrounding land uses of a
lesser intensity. The C-1 District is further intended to minimize the potential undesirable impacts of such
commercial uses on the surrounding residential neighborhoods which they serve. The C-1 District is
generally located away from the Village's central business district and provides amenities such as increased
open space and off-street parking and loading facilities to make the commercial uses more compatible with
the character of adjacent residential districts. The character of the C-1 District is pedestrian-oriented. The
C-1 District is intended to be served by public sanitary sewer and water supply facilities.
B. District Standards. The C-1 District is further intended to have the development standards as set forth in
Table 19.03.0302.
C. Permitted, Accessory, and Conditional Uses. See Sections 19.03.0603, 19.03.0604, 19.03.0605,

SECTION 19.03.0303 C-2 COMMUNITY BUSINESS DISTRICT
A. District Intent. The C-2 District is intended and designed to accommodate the needs of a much larger
consumer population than served by the C-1 District. The C-2 District is intended to provide for relatively
large groupings of retail sales and customer service establishments which offer a wide range of goods and
services in a community-serving shopping area. It is further intended that the C-2 District be applied in
locations which abut or front, and have access to, either directly or via frontage roads, heavily traveled major
arterial roadways. While the C-2 District is also intended to be vehicular traffic oriented, vehicular access
points are intended to be limited and the C-2 District is not intended to foster the design of "strip" shopping
areas. The C-2 District is characterized by business establishments that have on-site parking for customer
automobiles combined with a pedestrian-oriented shopping environment. Buildings constructed in the C-2
District may be clustered on parcels of land under individual or multiple ownership. The C-2 District is
intended to provide for an arrangement of retail trade establishments which are compatible in function and
operation. The various other requirements of the C-2 District are established to increase its compatibility
with surrounding areas consistent with the Village of Grafton Comprehensive Plan and components thereof.
The C-2 District is intended to be served by public sanitary sewer and water supply facilities.
B. District Standards. The C-2 District is further intended to have the development standards as set forth in
Table 19.03.0303.
C. Permitted, Accessory, and Conditional Uses. See Sections 19.03.0603, 19.03.0604, 19.03.0605,

A. General Intent. The PUD Districts are intended to be created, pursuant to Section 62.23(7)(b) of the
Wisconsin Statutes as amended, to foster developments that will: derive maximum benefit from coordinated
area site planning, diversified location of structures, mixed compatible uses that result in the provision of a
safe and efficient system for pedestrian and vehicular traffic, attractive recreation and landscaped open
spaces, economic design and location of public and private utilities and community facilities; and ensure
adequate standards of construction and planning. The unified and planned development of a site, in single or
corporate ownership or control at the time of application, may be permitted in a PUD District with one (1) or
more principal uses or structures and related accessory uses and structures. The regulations within a PUD
District need not be uniform throughout the individual PUD District except those types of intensity standards
set forth in this Division shall be followed unless otherwise specifically approved by the Village.
B. Open Space, Land Use Intensity, and Residential Density Intent. Each PUD district shall set forth its
land use intensity including, where applicable: the open space ratio (OSR), a maximum gross residential
density, maximum net residential density, maximum floor area ratio (GFAR and NFAR), and a minimum
landscape surface ratio (LSR). These shall be established on an individual PUD District basis to ensure the
intensity of development on the site is compatible with the context of the surrounding area, the Villages
comprehensive plan, and intensity standards in comparable zoning district(s).
C. Natural Resource Features Protection Intent. While the PUD District is intended to be flexible in its
application, it is not the intent of the PUD Districts to be used to alter or amend any of the prescribed natural
resource base protection standards advanced by this Ordinance.
SECTION 19.03.0402 CONSISTENCY OF THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT WITH
THE ADOPTED COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
A PUD District shall be in general conformance with or shall carry out the general objectives of the adopted Village
of Grafton Comprehensive Plan or other element or component of the Village of Grafton Comprehensive Plan.

in Table 19.03.0503 and lying within the base site area (as defined in Section 19.03.0502), shall be measured for
each natural resource feature present. The actual land area encompassed by each type of resource is then entered
into the column of Table 19.03.0503 titled "Acres of Land in Resource Feature." The acreage of each natural
resource feature shall be multiplied by its respective natural resource protection standard (to be selected from
Table 19.04.0100 of this Ordinance for applicable agricultural, residential, or nonresidential zoning district) to
determine the amount of resource protection land or area required to be kept in open space to protect the resource or
feature. The sum of all resource protection land on the site equals the total resource protection land. The total
resource protection land shall be calculated as indicated in Table 19.03.0503.

DIVISION 19.03.0700 CONDITIONAL USE STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
SECTION 19.03.0701 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES
A. General Standards. No Conditional Use Permit shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this
Ordinance unless the applicant shall establish the following:
1. Ordinance and Comprehensive Plan Purposes and Intent. The proposed use and development
will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this Ordinance was enacted
and for which the regulations of the zoning district in question were established and with the
general purpose and intent of the Village of Grafton Comprehensive Plan or element thereof.
2. Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will not have a substantial or undue adverse
or detrimental effect upon or endanger adjacent property, the character of the area, or the public
health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare and will not substantially diminish and impair
property values within the community or neighborhood.
3. Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use and development will be
constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with
the use and development of neighboring property according to the applicable zoning district
regulations.
4. Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development will be served adequately by
essential public facilities and services such as streets, public utilities including public water supply
system and sanitary sewer, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, public parks, libraries,
schools, and other public facilities and utilities or the applicant will provide adequately for such
facilities as provided by the Village Municipal Code.
5. Traffic Management. That vehicular ingress and egress at the proposed site shall not cause a
significant increase of traffic on residential streets. Unless waived by the Village Engineer, the
applicant shall submit a traffic study including existing, volumes, trip generation, and existing and
proposed level of service on adjacent arterial and collector streets for Plan Commission review.
6. Destruction of Significant Features. The Plan Commission may impose reasonable conditions on
the proposed use and development to avoid or minimize the destruction, loss, or damage of any
natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance, taking into account the surrounding
uses, the existing use of the site, and public convenience. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
7. Compliance with Standards. The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each
instance, be modified to a more restrictive requirement by the Village Board pursuant to the
recommendations of the Plan Commission. The proposed use and development shall comply with
all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provision of this Division. (Also see
Sections 19.03.1001 and 19.03.1004 of this Ordinance.) (Ord.. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
B. Special Standards for Specified Conditional Uses. When the zoning district regulations authorize a
conditional use in a particular zoning district and that the conditional use is indicated as having special
standards as set forth in either Section 19.04.0702 and 19.04.0703 of this Division, a Conditional Use Permit
for such use in such zoning district shall not be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall establish
compliance with all such special standards.
C. Considerations. The Plan Commission shall review the site, existing and proposed structures, architectural
plans, neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access, traffic generation, circulation
and safety, drainage, sewerage and water systems, and the proposed operation. In determining whether the
19- 75
applicants evidence establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Plan Commission shall also
consider the following:
1. Public Benefit. Whether and to what extent the proposed use and development at the particular
location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of
the public convenience or will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or community.
2. Alternative Locations. Whether and to what extent such public goals can be met by the location
of the proposed use and development at another site or in another area that may be more
appropriate based upon public need than the proposed site as determined by the Plan Commission
and Village Board.
3. Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken to
minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use and development on the immediate vicinity
through building design, site design, landscaping, and screening.
(Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
D. Conditions on Conditional Use Permits. The Plan Commission such conditions and limitations
concerning use, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion
dates, sureties, character, location, landscaping, maintenance, screening, fencing, operation, hours of
operation, improved circulation, deed restrictions, highway and arterial street access restrictions, increased
yards, off-street parking requirements, and any other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this
Ordinance upon the premises benefited by the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit as may be necessary or
appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements near the subject
property, upon such public facilities and services, protection of the public interest, and to secure compliance
with the standards and requirements specified in this Ordinance. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth
in the approval of the Conditional Use Permit, and the Plan Commission may require the unconditional
consent of the applicant to such conditions. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation
of this Ordinance and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the Conditional Use Permit. (Ord. 005,
Series 2004, Part 1)
E. Affidavit of Compliance with Conditions. In all cases in which conditional uses are granted, the Plan
Commission shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated to in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied with. Whenever any
Conditional Use Permit granted pursuant to this Ordinance is made subject to conditions or limitations to be
met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such conditions, file an affidavit with the Building
Inspector so stating. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
F. Effect of Issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. The grant of a Conditional Use Permit shall not authorize
the establishment or extension of any such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of
applications for any other permits or approvals that may be required by the ordinances and codes of the
Village of Grafton, including but not limited to Building Permit, land division approval, landscape plan
approval, site plan approval, or other type of permit or approval.
G. Limitations on Conditional Use Permits.
1. Time Limitations. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Plan Commission, no
Conditional Use Permit shall be valid for a period longer than one (1) year, from the date of
issuance, unless a Building Permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period
and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
2. Use Discontinuance. A Conditional Use Permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular
use for which it was issued. Such permits shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or
effect if such use shall be discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months or more; provided,
however, that if such use is discontinued due to labor strikes, war, natural disasters, or other similar
cause(s) beyond the reasonable control of the holder of the Conditional Use Permit, such twelve
(12) month period may be extended for a period equal to the period that the holder of the
Conditional Use Permit is prevented from engaging in the particular use for which the Conditional
Use Permit was issued.
19- 76
3. Conditional Use Permit Runs with Land and Not the Applicant. Unless otherwise provided in
the approval of the Conditional Use Permit, a Conditional Use Permit shall be deemed to relate to,
and to be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than the applicant, owner, or operator
of such use or lot. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
4. Additions and Enlargements to Legal Conditional Uses. Any additions or enlargements of an
existing legal conditional use may be completed only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the
standards and limitations provided in this Ordinance for its original approval. A legal conditional
use shall be defined as a use for which the Village had issued a Conditional Use Permit or which
was otherwise legally established before said type of use became a conditional use under this
Ordinance. (Ord. 010, Series 2002, Part 7).
5. Additions and Enlargements to Illegal Conditional Uses. Any additions or enlargements of an
existing illegal conditional use shall not be allowed unless the entire use is made to conform to all
the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and pursuant to the procedures and
subject to the standards and limitations provided in this Ordinance. An illegal conditional use shall
be defined as a use for which the Village had not issued a Conditional Use Permit or which was
otherwise not legally established before said type of use became a conditional use under this
Ordinance. (Ord. 010, Series 2002, Part 7).
H. Amendments to Conditional Use Permits. A Conditional Use Permit may be amended, varied, or altered
only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the standards and limitations provided in this Ordinance for
its original approval.

O. Retail and Commercial Service Buildings In Excess of 20,000 Square Feet of Area. The following
requirements are applicable to all new retail and commercial service buildings in excess of twenty thousand
(20,000) gross square feet and shall be conditional uses in the zoning districts in which they are allowed,
except that a separate Conditional Use Permit is not required where such buildings are part of a PID
District, PUD District, or BP District. All additions to existing retail and commercial service buildings,
built either before or after the adoption of this Ordinance, which brings the total building size to over
twenty thousand (20,000) gross square feet shall also require a Conditional Use Permit. The following
standards are intended to ensure that large retail and commercial service buildings, and the sites they
occupy, are properly located and compatible with the surrounding area and community character of the
Village. Such projects shall also be subject to the more general standards for the approval of Conditional
Use Permits or PUD Districts. (Ord. 008, Series 2001, Part 11).
1. Compatibility with Village Plans. The applicant shall provide, through a written report
submitted with the petition for a Conditional Use Permit or rezoning application for the BP, PID,
or PUD Districts, adequate evidence that the proposed building and overall development project
shall be compatible with the Village's community character, urban design, natural area
preservation, commercial development, redevelopment, or community facility objectives as
expressed in adopted elements of the Village's master plan.
2. Building Materials. Building materials shall be unified throughout the building, and shall
complement other buildings in the vicinity. Exterior building materials shall be of high and
comparable aesthetic quality on all sides. Building materials such as glass, brick, decorative
concrete block, or stucco shall be used, as determined by the architectural review board, plan
commission, and village board. Decorative architectural metal with concealed fasteners may be
approved if sensitively incorporated into the overall design of the building.
3. Building Design. The building exterior shall be unified in design throughout the structure, and
shall complement other buildings in the vicinity. The building shall employ varying building
setbacks, height, roof treatments, door and window openings, and other structural and decorative
elements to reduce apparent size and scale. A minimum of twenty (20) percent of all of the
combined façades of the structure shall employ actual façade protrusions or recesses. A minimum
of twenty (20) percent of all of the combined linear roof eave or parapet lines of the structure shall
employ differences in height, with such differences being six (6) feet or more as measured eave to
19- 88
eave or parapet to parapet for buildings over fifty thousand (50,000) square feet. Roofs with
particular slopes may be required by the Village to complement existing buildings or otherwise
establish a particular aesthetic objective. Ground floor facades that face and are within one
hundred (100) feet of public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or
other such features along no less than fifty (50) percent of their horizontal length. The integration
of windows into building design is strongly encouraged.
4. Building Entrances. Public building entryways shall be clearly defined and highly visible on the
buildings exterior design, and shall be emphasized by on-site traffic flow patterns. Two (2) or
more of the following design features shall be incorporated into all public building entryways:
canopies or porticos, overhangs, projections, arcades, peaked roof forms, arches, outdoor patios,
display windows, distinct architectural details. All sides of the building that directly face or abut a
public street or public parking area shall have at least one public entrance, except that the Village
shall not require building entrances on more than two (2) sides of any building or on frontages
facing and within three hundred (300) feet of the Interstate Highway.
5. Building Color. Building façade colors shall be non-reflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone. The
use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors on façades shall be
prohibited. Building trim and architectural accent elements may feature brighter colors, but such
colors shall be muted, not metallic, not fluorescent, and not specific to particular uses or tenants.
Standard corporate and trademark colors shall be permitted only on sign face and copy areas,
subject to the limitations in Section 19.03.0703(Q)(13).
6. Building Location. Modest building setbacks are encouraged. Where buildings are proposed to
be distant from a public street, the overall development design shall include smaller buildings on
pads or outlots closer to the street.
7. Screening. Mechanical equipment, refuse containers and any permitted outdoor storage shall be
fully concealed from on-site and off-site ground level views, with materials identical to those used
on the building exterior. Loading docks shall be completely screened from surrounding roads and
properties. Said screening may be accomplished through loading areas internal to buildings,
screen walls which match the building exterior in materials and design, fully opaque landscaping
at time of planting, or combinations of the above. Gates and fencing may be used for security and
access, but not for screening, and shall be of high aesthetic quality.
8. Traffic Impact. All projects that include buildings over twenty thousand (20,000) square feet
shall have direct access to an arterial street, or shall dedicate public roads which have direct access
to a public street. Vehicle access shall be designed to accommodate peak on-site traffic volumes
without disrupting traffic on public streets or impairing pedestrian safety. This shall be
accomplished through adequate parking lot design and capacity; access drive entry throat length,
width, design, location, and number; and traffic control devices; and sidewalks. The site design
shall provide direct connections to adjacent land uses if required by the Village. Prior to
development approval, the applicants traffic engineer shall complete and present a traffic impact
analysis following Wisconsin Department of Transportation District Two guidelines. Where the
project will cause off-site public roads, intersections, or interchanges to function below level of
service C, as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Village may deny the
application, require a size reduction in the proposed development, or require that the developer
construct and/or pay for required off-site improvements.
9. Parking. Not more than fifty (50) percent of the off-street parking spaces shall be located directly
between the front façade of the building and the public street, unless additional buildings in the
overall development are or will be located between the main building and the public street. Such
additional buildings must be sufficient in size, location, and number to provide an effective visual
break between the public street and the parking lot. Parking lots in which the number of spaces
significantly exceeds the minimum number of parking spaces required in Division 19.05.0200 of
this Ordinance shall be allowed only with specific and reasonable justification. Parking lot design
shall employ interior, curbed landscaped islands at all parking aisle ends. In addition, the project
shall provide landscaped islands within each parking aisle spaced at intervals no greater than one
island per every twenty (20) spaces in that aisle. Islands at the ends of aisles shall count toward
meeting this requirement. Each required landscaped island shall be a minimum of three hundred
19- 89
(300) square feet in area. Landscaped medians shall also be used to break large parking areas into
smaller pods, with a maximum of one hundred (100) spaces in any one pod.
10. Natural Resources Protection. Each project shall meet the natural resource protection standards
set forth in Division 19.04.0100 of this Ordinance. In general, existing natural features shall be
integrated into the site design as a site and community amenity.
11. Landscaping. On-site landscaping shall be provided per the landscaping requirements of the C-4
District. In addition to the number of plant units required in the C-4 District based on the total site
area, the project shall provide:
a. Extensive building foundation landscaping for all building frontages facing public streets,
parking lots, or residential districts to provide visual breaks in the mass of the building.
Building foundation landscaping shall be placed so that, at maturity, the plants drip line
is within ten (10) feet of the foundation. Canopy/shade trees shall not be used to meet
this requirement.
b. Extensive paved area landscaping for all parking, driveway, and loading areas to screen
and provide visual breaks in the size of such paved areas. Canopy/shade trees shall be
emphasized within landscaped islands, with shrubs, groundcover, or grass preferred to
mulch or stones.
12. Lighting. On-site exterior lighting shall meet all the standards of Division 19.05.0400 of this
Ordinance, except that total cut-off luminaires with angles of less than ninety (90) degrees shall be
required for all pole and building security lighting. The color and design of pole lighting
standards shall be compatible with the building and the Villages public lighting in the area, if a
particular public lighting theme has been established for the area.
13. Signage. The plan for exterior signage shall provide for modest, coordinated, and complimentary
exterior sign locations, configurations, and colors throughout the development. All freestanding
signage within the development shall compliment on-building signage. Monument style ground
signs are strongly preferred over pole signs, and consolidated signs for multiple users are strongly
preferred over multiple individual signs. The Village may require the use of muted corporate
colors on signage if proposed colors are not compatible with the Villages design objectives for
the area.
14. Bicycle and Pedestrian Access. The entire development shall provide for safe pedestrian and
bicycle access to all uses within the development, connections to existing and planned public
pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and connections to adjacent properties. Sidewalks shall be
provided along the entire length of any façade containing a public entrance, leaving room for
foundation planting beds. Pedestrian walkways shall be provided from all building entrances to
existing or planned public sidewalks or pedestrian/bike facilities. Internal pedestrian walkways
must be distinguished from driving surfaces. Site design shall allow pedestrians to walk parallel
to moving cars. The development shall provide secure, integrated bicycle parking and pedestrian
furniture in appropriate quantities and location. The building shall provide awnings or other
weather protection features within thirty (30) feet of all customer entrances.
15. Central Areas/Features. Each development which contains a building over fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet in area shall provide central area(s) or feature(s) such as a patio/seating area,
pedestrian plaza with benches, outdoor playground area, water feature, and/or other such
deliberately designated areas or focal points that adequately enhance the development or
community. All such areas shall be openly accessible to the public, connected to the public and
private sidewalk system, designed with materials compatible with the building and remainder of
the site, and maintained over the life of the building and project.
16. Cart Returns. A minimum of one (1) two hundred (200) square foot cart return area shall be
provided for every one hundred (100) parking spaces. Cart corrals shall be of durable, all season
construction, and shall be designed and colored to be compatible with the building and parking lot
light standards. There shall be no exterior cart return or cart storage areas located within twenty19-
90
five (25) feet of the building.
17. Impact on Existing Grafton Business Locations. Where such a building is proposed as a
replacement location for a business already located within the Village, the Village shall prohibit
any privately imposed limits on the type of reuse of the previously occupied building through
conditions of sale or lease. If the applicant requires such limits, the applicant may seek Village
approval to demolish the previously occupied structure and prepare the site for future
redevelopment.
18. Waiver of Standards. The Plan Commission may waive any of the above standards by a threequarters
(3/4) vote of members in attendance, but only if supplemental design elements or
improvements are incorporated into the project which compensate for the waiver of the particular
standard. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)
19. Hours of Operation. Hours of operation shall be approved by the Plan Commission as a
component of the Conditional Use Permit. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 1)

The following requirements are applicable to all new retail and commercial service buildings in excess of
fifty thousand (50,000) gross square feet (Large Format Commercial Uses) and shall require a Conditional
Use Permit in the zoning districts in which they are allowed, except that a separate Conditional Use Permit
is not required where such buildings are part of a PID District, PUD District, or BP District. The following
standards are intended to ensure that:
 Large retail and commercial service buildings and the sites they occupy are properly located and
are compatible with the surrounding area and the community character of the Village,
 Such projects meet a demonstrated public need.
 Such projects promote a practical and viable re-use of the structures and the development site
within the context of the surrounding area.
Such projects shall also be subject to the more general standards for the approval of Conditional Use
Permits or PUD Districts and to all of the requirements in Section 19.03.0703 (P) above.
1. Reuse Plan Requirements. As a condition to issuance of a building permit, the property
owner/developer of large format commercial buildings shall provide one of the following to the

a. Option I - Cash Contribution. A cash contribution to the Village of $15,000 for the first
50,000 square feet of floor area and $0.10 for every additional square foot of usable space
to fund the future costs to the Village of preparing a reuse plan. The Village will deposit
the cash contribution in a separate non-lapsing interest bearing account with interest
accruing to the benefit of the Village. The Village may use the funds to market the
building for re-use and/or prepare or implement a redevelopment plan in the event that a
building remains vacant for more than 24 months and during that time, (a) the owner fails
to respond to written inquiries from the Village as to owners marketing and re-use
efforts, or (b) the owner requests the Village to undertake such efforts.
b. Option II - Re-Use Plan. A detailed reuse plan that clearly identifies the opportunities
and challenges of planning for redevelopment of any large retail or commercial building.

Plan Commission shall review and modify the Re-Use Plan to reflect any adopted
amendments to the Comprehensive Plan and then-current zoning regulations prior to
implementing the Re-Use Plan. The Plan Commission may only modify the Re-Use Plan
after mailing to the owner, by certified mail sent at least 10 days prior to the hearing, the
proposed modifications and notice of a public hearing at which the Plan Commission
shall consider the owner's comments.
3) Implementation of the Re-Use Plan. To reap the benefits of an Adopted Re-Use Plan
requires consistent implementation. The Village must be prepared to:
a) Review proposed land divisions, conditional use permits and planned
developments based on conformance with the Plan.
b) Facilitate and approve only those developments that are consistent with
the Adopted Re-Use Plan, paying particular attention to the proposed
land use pattern, the density and intensity of the proposed development,
community character and the availability of the appropriate
infrastructure to support
2. Waiver of Standards. The Plan Commission may waive any of the above standards by a threequarters
(3/4) vote of members in attendance, but only if supplemental re-use elements are
incorporated into the project which compensate for the waiver of the particular standard.
3. Vacant Sites Maintenance Requirements. As a condition of issuance of the conditional use

(i) Protection standards for steep slopes and woodlands shall be enforced over the total combined occurrences of such
features on lands held in contiguous single ownership, rather than over each of any two or more individual occurrences
of steep slopes or woodlands on such lands. Contiguous single ownership shall be defined as lands that both share a
common boundary and are singly owned by one individual, jointly owned by a married couple including that
individual, owned by a partnership or corporation in which that individual was a member, or any combination. Lands
shall be considered to share a common boundary even if they are divided by a public road or navigable waterway, or if
they connect at only one point. (Ord. 010, Series 2002, Part 13)
19-
4-3
B. Woodlands and Forests. The definition of woodlands and forests (mature and young), as applied to this
Division, appears in Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance. The determination of woodland and forest
boundaries shall be based on the following sources:
1. The most recent 1" = 400' aerial photographs prepared by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional
Planning Commission (SEWRPC) and available from either SEWRPC or from Ozaukee County
(most recent date only); and
2. A field survey of trees compiled by a registered land surveyor and identified by a landscape
architect, forester, arborist, or botanist with a professional degree in one of those fields of
endeavor.
Each woodland and forest area shall include the tree trunk and the area located within the dripline or tree
canopy. The area of woodlands and forests (mature and young), in square feet or acres, shall be measured
and graphically delineated on the "Natural Resource Protection Plan." Such woodland and forest area
drawing shall indicate all woodland and forest areas of the property meeting the minimum size criteria
established by the definitions of woodlands (mature and young) in Division 19.09.0100. In cases where the
drip line or canopy areas overlap, the areas of overlap shall only be counted once. In cases where drip line
or canopy areas overlap property lines, the property line(s) are to be used as the boundary for the woodland
or forest area, with only that portion of the dripline area located on the subject property counted toward the
woodland or forest area. The location, size, and summary of species types of all healthy trees having a
diameter at breast height (DBH) of ten (10) inches or greater that are located in woodland and forest areas
within twenty-five (25) feet of any proposed improvement and/or in woodland and forest areas to be
demolished due to the placement of improvements or grading are to be graphically shown on the "Natural
Resource Protection Plan" or submitted as a separate drawing. For the remaining undisturbed areas of the
development, Certified Survey Map, Subdivision Plat, or Condominium only the outline of woodland and
forest areas indicating whether they are mature or young woodlands is required. The Natural Resource
Protection Plan shall include an estimate of the percentage of all health trees within each woodland or
forest area that have a DBH of three (3) inches or greater and ten (10) inches or greater. (Ord. 008, Series
2001, Part 13)
C. Lakes and Ponds. Lakes and ponds, as defined in Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance, are to be
determined by using the definitions of "Lake" and "Pond" as set forth in Division 19.09.0100 of this
Ordinance and the sources in the order indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or
inappropriate, as determined by the Plan Commission, the succeeding source shall be used:
1. A topographic survey prepared by and certified by a Wisconsin registered land surveyor at a
contour interval of not less than two (2) feet.
2. Large scale 1"=200' Ozaukee County topographic maps.
3. U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps.
The area of lakes and ponds (in square feet or acres) shall be measured and graphically delineated on the
"Natural Resource Protection Plan."
D. Streams. Streams, as defined in Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance, are to be determined by using the
definitions of "Channel" and "Stream" (see Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance) and the sources in the
order indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the
Plan Commission, the succeeding source shall be used:
1. A topographic survey prepared by and certified by a Wisconsin registered land surveyor at a
contour interval of not less than two (2) feet.
2. Large scale 1"=200' Ozaukee County topographic maps.
19-
4-4
3. U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps.
The area of streams (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and graphically delineated on the "Natural
Resource Protection Plan."
E. Shore Buffers. Shore buffers, as defined in Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance, are to be determined
as the land within seventy-five (75) feet of the ordinary high water mark of all navigable waters and
parallel to that ordinary highwater mark, where required. Navigable waters are to be determined by using
the definition of "Navigable Water" set forth in Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance and the sources in
the order indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the
Plan Commission, the succeeding source shall be used:
1. A topographic survey prepared by and certified by a Wisconsin registered land surveyor at a
contour interval of not less than two (2) feet.
2. Large scale 1"=200' Ozaukee County topographic maps.
3. U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps.
The area of shore buffers (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and graphically delineated on the
"Natural Resource Protection Plan, except where shore buffers are both waived by the Plan Commission
and not required under State Statutes.
(Ord. 021, Series 2001, Part 2)
F. Floodplain/Floodways/Floodlands. The definition of floodplain, floodway, and floodlands appears in
Division 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance. The one hundred (100) year recurrence interval floodplain and
floodways shall be determined as depicted on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)
"Firm: Flood Insurance Rate Map(s)" with the effective date of March 18, 1991 as amended. Where a
conflict exists between the floodland limits as shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
(FEMA) "Firm: Flood Insurance Rate Map(s)" and actual field conditions, the elevations from the 100-year
recurrence interval flood profiles contained in the published Flood Insurance Study--Ozaukee County,
Wisconsin and Incorporated Areas prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
dated March 18, 1991 shall be used.
G. Wetlands (including Shoreland Wetlands). Wetlands and shoreland wetlands are defined in Division
19.09.0100 of this Ordinance. Wetland areas shall be determined by reference to the following sources in
the order shown below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate as determined by the
Plan Commission, the succeeding source shall be used:
1. Wetland inventory maps prepared for the Village of Grafton as part of the "Wisconsin Wetland
Inventory" prepared by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as amended.
2. Field survey and mapping of plant material by a botanist with a professional degree in either
botany or biology.
The area of wetlands and/or shoreland wetlands (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and
graphically delineated on the "Natural Resource Protection Plan."
H. Natural Resources Measurement. All land area within a proposed development, Certified Survey Map,
Subdivision Plat, or Condominium consisting of the natural resource features defined in this Ordinance
shall be accurately measured. The total square feet and acreage of each natural resource feature shall be
multiplied by its respective "Natural Resource Protection Standard" as set forth in Table 19.04.0100
"Natural Resource Protection Standards" of this Ordinance to determine the amount of each natural
resource feature to be protected by a conservation easement. The methodology, termed "Site Intensity and
Capacity Calculations," to be used for such calculations is set forth in Division 19.03.0500 of this
19-
4-5
Ordinance. If two (2) or more natural resource features are present on the same area of land, only the most
restrictive natural resource protection standard shall be used. [For example, if floodlands and woodlands
and forests occupy the same space on a site, the natural resource protection standard would be 100%
(100% is the resource protection standard for a floodland) for this area representing the higher of the two
standards.] Those areas to be demolished due to improvements or site grading or disturbed through the
application of permitted mitigation techniques shall also be measured and so noted but shall not be counted
as a natural resource area to be preserved.
SECTION 19.04.0103 NATURAL RESOURCE FEATURES MITIGATION
A. Intent of Mitigation. The Village of Grafton recognizes that, under certain circumstances, property
owners, Subdividers, or Condominium Developers may wish to develop in portions of those protected
natural resource feature areas shown as eligible for mitigation as indicated in Table 19.04.0100. In
Paragraph B of this Section the conditions for mitigation and mitigation standards are set forth for the
various natural resource features for which mitigation is allowed under the provisions of Table 19.04.0100.
The intent of this Section is not to permit greater destruction of natural resource features than is permitted
under the requirements of this Ordinance for typical property or development. This Section sets specific
standards for use when the extent of the natural resources on a site and the use of the regulations would
create a major hardship for said natural resource feature protection. Thus, mitigation is intended to be used
instead of a variance request when severe hardships would result from the strict enforcement of the natural
resource protection standards and requirements set forth in this Ordinance. Any off-site mitigation shall
take place within the incorporated Village of Grafton.
B. Mitigation Standards. The following methods, requirements, standards and/or criteria shall be followed
for the mitigation of those natural resource features that may be mitigated under the requirements set forth
under Table 19.04.0103:
1. Woodlands and Forests. Woodlands and forest areas may be mitigated under the following
requirements applicable to the mitigation of woodland and forest areas, except that the Plan
Commission may approve different sizes and types of plantings in mitigation areas where site
conditions or context warrant (Ord. 002, Series 2003, Part 1; Ord. 008, Series 2001, Part 14):
A. Mitigation shall include the planting of two (2) acres of new woodland/forest for every
one (1) acre of disturbed woodland/forest for which mitigation is required.
B. Mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlands/forests disturbed. Such mitigation
shall consist of the planting of new woodland/forest areas, as specified in Paragraph (A)
above, using the following numbers of plants per acre of mitigated area:
15 canopy trees, minimum 3.5-inch caliper*
12 canopy trees, minimum 2-inch caliper
250 canopy trees, minimum 4-foot high whips
50 understory trees, minimum 5-foot high whips
25 shrubs, minimum 12-inches high
*Note: Each 3.5-inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with two
(2) 1.5-inch caliper canopy trees.
All mitigation shall be in addition to landscaping required under Division
19.05.0300 of this Ordinance.
19-
4-6
2. Additional Requirements (Ord. 002, Series 2003 (Part 1)
A. The species of plants to be used in the mitigation of woodlands/forests shall be similar to
those destroyed and a minimum mix of six (6) species are to be planted. Acceptable
species for woodland and forest mitigation are as indicated in Table 19.04.0103 [Note:
These species represent what is found in a typical stand of Wisconsin southern mesic
forest.] No more than eighty (80) percent of the total number of trees planted for
mitigation purposes, however, shall be of any single species.
B. The land upon which the mitigation is to take place shall be protected with a deed
restriction and conservation easement as a permanent natural resource features
conservation easement.
C. No tree cutting or removal, after the adoption of this Ordinance, shall reduce the
woodland/forest natural resource features protection requirements of this Ordinance.

2. Lakes and Ponds. Lakes and ponds may be mitigated as may be permitted under the
requirements of applicable state and federal legislation, rules, and permit requirements. (Ord. 021,
Series 2001, Part 3)
Where permitted under the requirements of applicable state or federal legislation or rules, the
required lakes and ponds natural resource protection standard may be reduced and/or mitigated
only if such reduction and/or mitigation is part of a Village Engineer approved stormwater
drainage system that meets, at a minimum, all of the following criteria:
a. The time of concentration of stormwater flows remains unchanged or is lengthened.
b. Stormwater storage capacity is unchanged or increased.
c. Additional water is not backed up onto adjoining properties.
(Ord. 021, Series 2001, Part 3)
3. Floodplains, Floodways, and Floodlands. Floodplains, floodways, and floodlands may be
mitigated as may be permitted under the requirements of applicable state and federal legislation,
rules, and permit requirements. (Ord. 021, Series 2001, Part 4)
4. Wetlands and Shoreland Wetlands . . Wetland mitigation may be allowed as permitted
under the requirements of Section 281.37, Wisconsin Statutes, and administrative rules
promulgated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) under that
Section. If such statute or rules do not provide sufficient guidance on required
mitigation, the Village shall require the preparation and submittal of a wetland
mitigation plan by a professional wetland mitigation specialist, and the petitioner shall
be responsible for all costs necessary for the Village to conduct a professional review of
the mitigation plan. In addition, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
19-
4-8
pursuant to the requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344)
and/or the WDNR shall be submitted to the Village of Grafton certifying that filling
has been approved and permitted by the Corps and/or WDNR. Alternatively, the
petitioner must obtain and provide to the Village written correspondence from said
agencies that a state or federal permit is not required, as a condition of Village review.
(Ord. 021, Series 2001, Part 5)
C. Off-Site Mitigation. Off-site mitigation may be permitted by the Plan Commission if such off-site
mitigation occurs within the same watershed as the natural resource feature, or property, being mitigated
and follows the methods, requirements, standards, and/or criteria set forth under Paragraph B. of Section
19.04.0103 of this Ordinance. All permitted off-site mitigation shall occur within the corporate limits of the
Village of Grafton.

PART 5: DESIGN STANDARDS
DIVISION 19.05.0100 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION 19.05.0101 ACCESS TO PUBLIC STREETS
This Section sets forth vehicular access requirements for proposed site plans for developments which abut arterial, collector,
and minor streets. This Ordinance recognizes that public streets are a public investment that requires control mechanisms to
assure both public safety and functional capacity. Proposed development for residential and nonresidential uses shall meet
the following requirements:
A. Access Standards for All Residential and Nonresidential Uses. All proposed site plans proposed for residential
and/or nonresidential uses in residential and/or nonresidential zoning districts shall meet the following standards:
1. Controlled Access to Public Streets. Lot and parcel vehicular access points shall be permitted only at
locations according to this Ordinance and other Village of Grafton adopted plans and ordinances. The Plan
Commission may limit vehicular access to any adjoining arterial, collector, or minor street.
2. Distance Between Vehicular Access Points. Within the MFR-1, MFR-2, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, O, BP, M-
1, PID, I, PR, and PUD Districts, the spacing of vehicular access points from arterial streets and highways
to lots and parcels created after the effective date of this Ordinance shall be determined as a function of
arterial street and highway operating speeds. The minimum spacing between vehicular access points along
such streets or highways, to the extent deemed practicable by the Plan Commission, shall be determined
according to Table 19.05.0101(A). These spacings are based upon average vehicle acceleration and
deceleration rates and are considered necessary to maintain safe traffic operation.

July 1983.
3. Limitation of Access to Interstate, United States, State Trunk Highways, and County Trunk
Highways. No new direct vehicular access shall be allowed to interstate, United States, and state or county
trunk highway public rights-of-way unless approved by the authority having jurisdiction and the Village
Plan Commission.
19- 5 - 3
4. Temporary Access.
a. Village Streets. On Village streets, the Village Board may grant temporary access to properties
and require their closure when access through adjoining properties is acquired upon
recommendation by the Plan Commission. Such access shall be temporary, revocable, and subject
to any conditions required and shall be issued for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.
b. County Streets and Highways. Temporary access to Ozaukee County street and highway rightsof-
way are reviewed and may be approved by the Ozaukee County Highway Department. It is the
applicant's responsibility to obtain all necessary approvals from the Ozaukee County Highway
Department for all such temporary access points proposed before site plan approval by the Village.
c. State Highways. Temporary accesses to State highway rights-of-way are reviewed and may be
approved by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. It is the applicant's responsibility to
obtain all necessary approvals from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation for all such
temporary access points proposed before site plan approval by the Village.
5. Area Circulation Plan May Be Required. The Plan Commission may require the preparation of an area
circulation plan for the proposed development covering several properties in an area surrounding a
proposed site plan. The delineation of the area for the preparation of an area circulation plan shall be
determined by the Plan Commission upon recommendation of the Village Engineer or Village Planner.
Such a plan may require the sharing of access locations or temporary access. All landowners, except those
with a previously approved site plan, shall be required to conform to such an area circulation plan once it is
adopted by the Plan Commission as a component, or element, of the Village of Grafton Comprehensive
Plan. The Plan Commission may require that such an area circulation plan be prepared based upon the
conduct of a traffic impact analysis conducted by a licensed professional engineer with expertise in traffic
engineering. The Village Engineer and Village Planner shall review all such studies and assist the Plan
Commission.
6. Vehicular Non-access Reservations Required. The Plan Commission may require deed restrictions to be
placed on a lot or parcel for which a site plan is proposed to limit vehicular access to abutting arterial,
collector, or minor streets and highways. A landscaped bufferyard of an adequate bufferyard intensity
level, as determined by the Plan Commission or by Division 19.05.0300 of this Ordinance, shall be
provided in vehicular non-access reservations along the property line abutting a public street right-of-way.
In such situations, vehicular access to such lots may be provided by an abutting minor or collector street at
designated access driveways. Such vehicular nonaccess reservations shall be graphically so noted on site
plans, as a formal deed restriction, subdivision plat, or by certified survey map formally filed with the
Ozaukee County Register of Deeds before their approval by the Village.
7. Arterial Street and Highway Access and Street Intersections. No new direct public or private access
shall be permitted to an arterial street or highway within two hundred and fifty (250) feet of the intersection
of the right-of-way lines of another arterial street or highway unless shown on the Village adopted
Comprehensive Plan or component thereof.
8. Minor Streets and Vehicular Access Point Alignments. Minor streets and vehicular access points along
both sides of a collector and/or arterial street shall be aligned to assist in reducing the number of driveways
needed and to improve safety conditions related to access to the street system.
9. Sight Distance and Driveway Placement. Direct vehicular access placement on abutting collector and
arterial streets and highways shall be such that an exiting vehicle has a minimum unobstructed sight
distance according to Table 19.05.0101(B) based upon the operating design speed of the abutting collector
or arterial street or highway.

B. Access Standards for Nonresidential and Multiple-Family Residential Uses. All proposed site plans
proposed for nonresidential and multiple-family residential uses in nonresidential and/or multiple-family residential zoning
districts shall meet the following standards:
1. Maximum Number of Vehicular Access Points Per Lot. Generally, along arterial streets and highways
(including lots that abut the frontage roads of said rights-of-way), where the abutting street frontage is less
than three hundred and fifty (350) feet, a maximum of one (1) vehicular access point shall be permitted to a
particular lot from each of any one (1) or two (2) abutting arterial streets and highways. One (1) additional
driveway entrance along a single continuous lot with frontage greater than three hundred fifty (350) feet
may be permitted by the Plan Commission. When a shared vehicular access point is used by two (2) or
more abutting lots, said shared vehicular access point shall be considered as one (1) single vehicular access
point for each lot or parcel served. These standards are subject to meeting the other standards of this
Division.
2. Provision of Shared Vehicular Access Points Between Lots. Vehicular access points planned to be
located along property lines, or closer than six (6) feet from a property line, shall be shared vehicular access
points with the abutting lot or parcel. The vehicular access point centerline may be the property line
between two (2) lots or parcels of land or may be a mutually agreed upon land access easement. Shared
vehicular access points within single and two family districts may be permitted with Plan Commission
approval. (Ord. 031, Series 2000, Part 1)
SECTION 19.05.0102 EASEMENTS
A. Natural Resource Features Protection/Mitigation, Conservation, Landscape Bufferyard, and Utility
Easements Required. The Plan Commission shall require natural resource features protection/mitigation,
conservation, landscape bufferyard, and/or utility easements of widths deemed adequate for the intended purpose on
each side of all rear lot lines and on side lot lines or across lots where necessary or advisable for natural resource
feature protection, landscape bufferyards (see Division 19.05.0300 of this Ordinance), electric power and
communication lines, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, and gas, water, and other utility lines.
B. Site Traversed by Watercourse, Drainage way Channel, or Stream Where a site is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way channel, or stream, an adequate drainage way or easement shall be provided as may be required by the
Village Engineer. The location, width, alignment, and improvement of such drainage way or easement shall be
subject to the approval of the Plan Commission, and parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith. Where necessary, stormwater drainage shall be maintained by landscaped open channels of adequate size
and grade to hydraulically accommodate 100-year recurrence interval storm flows. These design details are subject
19- 5 - 5
to review and approval by the Village Engineer.
C. Minimum Width Required for All Utility Easements. All utility easements shall be a minimum of twelve (12)
feet in width when recommended by the Village Engineer.

SECTION 19.05.0201 TRAFFIC VISIBILITY
In order to provide adequate vision clearance, no obstructions are permitted between the heights of two and one-half (2.5)
feet and ten (10) feet above the plane through the mean curb grades within the triangular space formed by any two (2)
existing or proposed intersecting street right-of-way or alley right-of-way lines and a line joining points on such lines, located
a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from their intersection. In the case of arterial streets, the corner cut-off distances establishing
the triangular vision clearance space shall be increased to a minimum of fifty (50) feet on the arterial street.
SECTION 19.05.0202 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
In all districts no vacant land shall be occupied or used and no building shall be erected, enlarged, extended, or increased, or
used including, but not limited to, use by a new use or changed use, until and in connection with every use, there shall be
provided off-street parking stalls for all vehicles according to the following:
A. Adequate Access. Adequate access to a public street shall be provided for each parking space. Driveways shall be
at least twelve (12) feet wide for one- and two-family dwellings, and twenty-four (24) feet wide for all other uses,
except that driveways in the CBD District and PUD Districts within the rea subject to the Grafton Downtown Master
Plan may be reduced to twenty (20) feet in width. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly onto an
aisle or driveway that is wide enough to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking space.
(Ord. 010, Series 2002, Part 14)
B. Minimum Parking Space Size. Except as allowed below in the CBD District and PUD Districts within the area
subject to the Grafton Downtown Master Plan, the size of each parking space shall be not less than one hundred and
eighty (180) square feet in area nor less than nine (9) feet in width, exclusive of the space required for ingress and
egress. In the CBD District and PUD Districts within the area subject to the Grafton Downtown Master Plan, the
size of not more than twenty (20) percent of all parking spaced in a parking lot may be as small as one hundred and
thirty (130) square feet in area and eight (8) feet in width, exclusive of the space required for ingress and egress and
provided that such spaces are signed for compact cars only. See Paragraph (I)(2) below for the minimum
dimensions for off-street parking spaces provided for use by persons with disabilities. (Ord. 010, Series 2002, Part
15)
C. Minimum Required Parking Lot Setbacks and Screening/Landscaping.
1. General. Any building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be provided with off-street parking
spaces within the property line limits of the property being served, or within the limits of a common
parking area serving one (1) or more buildings. Except where shared access or parking is permitted by the
Plan Commission, off-street parking spaces and internal circulation drives shall in no case be closer than:
a. Four (4) feet to any property line including the base setback line in single family and two family
residential districts and in Planned Unit Developments for single and two-family housing.
b. Three (3) feet to any property line in all zoning districts within the area subject to the Grafton
Downtown master Plan, created after April 18, 2000, provided that a fully opaque decorative fence, wall or
all season landscape screening is also planned in that strip. (Ord. 022, Series 2004, Part 1-part)
c. Zero (0) feet to any property line on any residential lot existing before April 17, 2000. However,
existing driveways on lots created before that date shall not violate the setback or encroachment any further

D. Off-Street Parking Requirements for Mixed or Combined Uses Located within the Same Building or On the
Same Lot or Parcel. Combinations of any of the uses set forth in Table 19.05.0203 shall provide the total number of
off-street parking stalls and/or queuing space required for each individual use.
E. Potential Reductions of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces and the Provision of Reserve Off-Street Parking
Area.
1. The Plan Commission may decrease the required number of off-street parking spaces by up to twenty-five
(25) percent of the requirement based upon one or more of the following criteria:
a. Technical documentation furnished by the applicant which indicates, to the satisfaction of the Plan
Commission, that actual off-street parking demand for that particular use is less than the required
standard set forth in Table 19.05.0203 of this Ordinance.
b. Bicycle parking facilities will be provided through racks, lockers, or equivalent structures located
convenient to the proposed use.
c. A public transportation route is located within five hundred (500) feet of the property.
2. In the event the number of required off-street parking spaces is reduced as allowed under this Section, the
Plan Commission may also require that sufficient area on the property be held in reserve for the potential
future development of off-street parking to meet the requirements of Table 19.05.0203. If required by the
Zoning Administrator or Plan Commission, such reserve off-street parking area shall be shown and noted on
the site plan, maintained as open space, and developed with off-street parking spaces when the Village
determines that such off-street parking is necessary due to parking demand on the property which exceeds
original expectations, of the loss of bicycle of public transit access or facilities. The property owner or
applicant shall provide the Village with a financial surety in a form acceptable to the Village Attorney and in
an amount of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the cost to construct the additional off-street parking
spaces prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.

DIVISION 19.05.0300 LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER DEVELOPMENT
REGULATIONS
SECTION 19.05.0301 LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. Purpose. This Section is established to create uniform landscape, screening and tree preservation
standards for development of property in the Village of Grafton and the review of plans in order to ensure
that the Village remains attractive, safe and comfortable. This Ordinance shall govern all developments
except detached single-family and attached two-family residentially used and zoned structures. Every
development shall provide sufficient landscaping so that neighboring properties are shielded from the
negative visual influence of development, and the appearance and desirability of development contributes
to the overall attractiveness and economic health of the Village of Grafton.
2. Plan Requirements. The following shall establish the standards for the preparation and submission of
required plans for landscape, screening and tree preservation:
19-5 - 2 7
a. Landscape Plan Required. A landscape plan following the standards set forth in this Section shall be
required for all projects requiring Site Plan Review. The Landscape Plan shall be prepared by a
landscape architect, certified nursery professional or master gardener. Landscaping on any
existing or proposed street right-of-way shall comply with the requirements as set forth by the Village
of Grafton Public Works Director pursuant to street construction standards. Landscape Plans shall be
reviewed and approved as a part of the Site Plan Review procedures contained in Section 19.06.0100.
b. Content of Landscape Plan. All landscape plans shall include or have attached thereto the following
information:
(i) North arrow, scale, date of plan and any subsequent revisions.
(ii) The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed buildings, structures, parking lots and
driveways, roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, signs, refuse disposal areas,
fences, free standing electrical equipment, light fixtures, other surface utility structures, and other
free standing structural features, recreational facilities, setbacks and easements. The landscape
plan shall be drawn at a scale not smaller than 1 inch = 100 feet.
(iii) The location, quantity, size at planting, and both scientific and common names of all proposed
plant materials.

and common names of all proposed plant materials.
(vi) The designation, location, type, and size of all existing trees 4 inches and larger in trunk diameter
measured one foot above natural grade. Any trees to be removed should be clearly identified.
Trees which will be used to meet landscape requirements shall also be indicated. If required for
reasons of clarity, this information may be placed on an additional illustration.
Where existing trees are grouped in a dense cluster, an overall tree mass may be used without a
specific delineation of individual trees. If this technique is used, protected trees used to meet site
landscape requirements must be tagged on-site and identified on the plan in tabular form.
(vii) Details of all fences and walls proposed to be constructed on the site.
(viii) Elevations, cross-sections and other site or construction details determined to be necessary by the
Director of Planning and Development.

Development for any substitutions or alterations to the plan.
(2) It is the responsibility of the landscape installer to have underground utilities located by
Diggers Hotline prior to installation.
(x) Name and contact information of the property owner.
(xi) Name and contact information of the person/company who prepared the plan.
3. Timing of Landscape Improvements. All required landscaping shall be installed prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy. The best times for planting in this area are early spring and early fall. Plants
planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration.
If weather conditions or other circumstances beyond the developer's control prevent installation of all or
portions of the landscape materials the procedures outlined for Certificate for Occupancy in Section
19.07.0104 must be followed.
19-5 - 2 8
4. Guarantee. All plantings shall be guaranteed by the property owner or business to be in a healthy and
flourishing condition at all times.
B. LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS
The following shall establish standards for the landscape improvements required to be installed as part of the
development of new buildings, structures and uses of land governed by this Section:
1. Types of Landscaped Areas. This article regulates landscaping of five distinct areas of a parcel as follows:
a. Interior Parkway
b. Perimeter Landscape Area
c. Foundation Area
d. Parking Lots
2. Landscaped Criteria.
a. Interior Parkway Landscaping. An interior parkway shall be provided in all zoning districts identified
in the following table:

Except for access drives, interior parkways shall be landscaped as follows:
Where parking is provided in the street yard, 1 tree per 40 feet of street frontage shall be provided. At
least 50 percent of the required trees shall be large deciduous or evergreen trees as identified in the
Recommended Trees, Shrubs, Evergreen, and Ground Cover List subsection. Variety of species may
vary depending on design intent.
In addition, shrub planting shall screen the parking area from the roadway. This shrub planting shall
be a minimum of 3 feet in height and be located within the interior parkway. A maximum of 25
percent of the parking lot frontage may be left unscreened to permit design flexibility. The remainder
of the interior parkway shall be planted with ground cover, flowers, or grass.
(i) Where no parking spaces will be located in the front yard, 1 tree per 50 feet of street frontage
shall be provided in the front yard. At least 50 percent of the required trees shall be large
deciduous or evergreen trees as identified in the Recommended Trees, Shrubs, Evergreen, and
Ground Cover List. Tree type may vary depending on design intent. The remainder of the interior
parkway shall be planted with shrubs, ground cover, flowers, or grass.
19-5 - 3 0
(ii) For corner lots, interior parkways shall be provided along both streets.
b. Perimeter Landscape Area.
(i) The perimeter area shall be equal to the required zoning district side and rear yard setbacks for
the property as outlined in Development Standards Tables for each zoning district.
(ii) Within the perimeter areas, berming, trees, and shrubs shall be provided to create a visual
separation between properties. Appropriate berm height will depend on the width of the landscape
area, with no berm having a slope greater than 3:1. A minimum of 40 percent of the length of the
perimeter shall be planted with shrubs that will reach a height of at least 4 feet. Trees shall be
provided in a quantity equal to one tree per 75 feet of perimeter length. Tree spacing shall be
determined by tree species and design considerations. Up to 50 percent of the required trees in
this screening alternative may be small deciduous trees.
c. Bufferyard Screening. The appropriateness of proposed bufferyard landscaping will depend upon the
relationship between the proposed use of the property, the use on adjacent properties, and the master
plan for the development of the area. Also, bufferyards will not be required for properties located in
the downtown pursuant to the Village of Grafton Downtown Master. Three types of bufferyard
screening have been defined. The particular type of screening that will be required shall depend upon
the relationship of the proposed land use and the adjacent land uses. Minimum landscape
requirements shall be as follows:
(i) Screening Between Adjacent Residential and Non-Residential Uses. These landscape
requirements are designed to provide a substantial buffer between residential and non-residential
uses. Where a residential use abuts a non-residential use, one of the following three buffering
alternatives shall be required. The property owner may select the buffering alternative which best
meets the configuration of the site and the proposed development. All fences, walls and hedges
shall comply with all Village of Grafton codes.
(1) Alternative A: The buffering area shall be a minimum of 8 feet in width for this alternative.
An opaque brick or other approved decorative masonry wall 6 feet high shall be constructed
along the entire perimeter, excluding area within the required front yard setback. The wall
may be continued within the front yard provided the height is reduced to 4 feet. Large
19-5 - 3 1
deciduous trees in a quantity equal to one tree per 60 feet of perimeter length shall be
provided. Tree spacing shall be determined by tree species and design considerations, and are
not required to be evenly spaced. Shrubs shall be planted within the buffer area at a minimum
rate of 10 per 100 feet, massed appropriately in clusters.
(2) Alternative B: A minimum 12 foot average buffer area shall be required for this alternative. A
fence of wood or other approved material 6 feet high and at least 75 percent opaque shall be
constructed along the entire perimeter, excluding area within the required front yard setback.
The fence may be continued within the front yard provided the height is reduced to 4 feet.
Shrubs shall be planted within the buffer area at a minimum rate of 15 per 100 feet, massed
appropriately in clusters. Large deciduous trees shall be provided in a quantity equal to 1 tree
per 60 feet of perimeter length. Tree location shall be determined by tree species and design
considerations.
(3) Alternative C: A minimum 25 foot buffer area shall be required for this alternative. A berm at
least 3 feet in height with a maximum 3:1 slope shall be constructed along the entire
perimeter. Breaks in the berm may be provided as appropriate to accommodate drainage. The
berm shall be planted with shrubs 4 feet or greater in height to provide screening along at
least 75 percent of the perimeter length. Trees shall be provided in a quantity equal to one
tree per 60 feet of perimeter length. Tree spacing shall be determined by tree species and
19-5 - 3 2
design considerations. Up to 25 percent of the required trees in this screening alternative may
be small deciduous trees.
(ii) Screening of Parking Areas. The following landscape requirements are designed to screen
parking areas from adjacent non-residential uses or multi-family residential uses. Where a nonresidential
or multi-family residential use parking lot will be located adjacent to a residential use,
the landscaping shall comply with the screening regulations outlined in Subsection (i) above. A
parking lot will be placed along a perimeter such that parked cars will face the abutting nonresidential
property. Shrubs and trees shall be appropriately placed to maximize the screening of
automobiles. Shrubs shall be provided along at least 80 percent of the length of the parking area.
Shrubs shall be a minimum of 3 feet in height at maturity when screening a parking lot. Trees
shall be provided in a quantity equal to one large deciduous tree per 60 feet of parking lot length.
Tree spacing shall be determined by tree species and design considerations. Up to 25 percent of
the required trees in this screening alternative may be small deciduous trees.
19-5 - 3 3
(iii)Screening Between Single- and Multi-Family Residential Uses (not including parking areas). This
landscape screening is generally required between single- and multi-family residential areas.
Berming, trees, and shrubs shall be provided to create a visual separation between properties.
Appropriate berm height will depend on the width of the landscape area, with no berm having a
slope greater than 3:1. A minimum of 60 percent of the length of the perimeter shall be planted
with shrubs that will reach a height of at least 6 feet. Trees shall be provided in a quantity equal to
one tree per 60 feet of perimeter length. Tree spacing shall be determined by tree species and
design considerations. Up to 25 percent of the required trees in this screening alternative may be
small deciduous trees.
d. Foundation Area Landscaping.
(i) Purpose. Planting should emphasize softening large expanses of building walls, accenting
building entrances and architectural features, and screening mechanical equipment. Where
extended roofs or canopies are used to provide a covered walkway adjacent to a building,
foundation plantings are not required. Landscaping is required to separate vehicular areas from
buildings.
(ii) Location. Foundation landscaping areas shall be located along or adjacent to each applicable
front, side or rear of a building, provided, however, where a portion of the front, side or rear of a
building is devoted to pedestrian ingress/egress, vehicular ingress/egress, loading or drop-off
zones, foundation landscaping areas may be aggregated into one or more locations along or
abutting such front, side or rear of a building.
(iii) Relationship to Buildings. Foundation landscaping areas shall be located adjacent to the building;
or begin within 12 feet of the building (in the case of a walkway which runs adjacent to the
building).
(iv) Area. Foundation landscaping areas shall have a total area in square feet of not less than 2 feet
times the length of the wall (2 feet x length of wall = area in square feet for foundation
landscaping) to which the foundation landscaping is oriented.
(v) Plantings. Foundation landscaping areas shall be landscaped with grass, trees, or shrubs/hedge
plants, or in combination with other suitable ground cover materials and maintained.
19-5 - 3 4
(vi) Minimum Dimension. Foundation landscaping areas shall maintain a minimum depth in the
smallest dimension of 6 feet, provided, however, the Director of Planning and Development may
approve up to 25 percent of a foundation landscaping area to be included in above-ground
planters having a minimum dimension of 3 feet.
e. Parking Lot Landscaping. Landscaping shall be required within all parking lots to meet the following
standards:
(i) There shall be a minimum 9 foot wide curbed planting island at both ends of every parking row.
The depth of the planting island shall be equal to the depth of the parking stalls.
19-5 - 3 5
(ii) All trees within a landscape island shall be pruned to have branching starting no less than 6 feet
above the pavement.
(iii)To break up long expanses of parking rows, landscape islands are required. One of the following
alternatives shall be used to divide rows of parking spaces.
(1) Alternative A. A continuous curbed landscape island between rows may be provided in lieu
of full stall planting islands between parking bays. Where such a continuous island is
provided, it shall be a minimum of 9 feet in width and shall contain a minimum of one tree
per 10 lineal parking spaces.
19-5 - 3 6
(2) Alternative B. One landscape island shall be constructed for every 10 parking stalls. A curbed
island at least 9 feet-wide and as deep as the parking stalls shall be provided to divide the bay
length. There shall be a minimum of one large deciduous tree per island.
In addition to required trees, an appropriate planting of shrubs, ground cover plants, flowers,
sodded lawn and natural mulch only shall be provided within all landscape islands. To insure
vehicular visibility, shrubs shall not exceed a mature height of 30 inches above pavement on
landscape islands at the end of parking rows.
3. Landscape Design Requirements. Functional activities within and adjoining the development site must be
considered in the design of landscape improvements, including consideration of the following:
a. Service Area Screening. All service areas shall be screened from view through the use of evergreen
plant materials, a fence, or masonry screen wall compatible with the proposed building design.
(i) Trash dumpsters and other waste receptacles or equipment shall be screened with a fence or 3
sided brick or other approved masonry walls at least 6 feet in height, with a solid, attractive single
or double access gate on one side only.
(ii) All utility equipment (air conditioners, transformers, etc.) shall be provided with appropriate
planting screens. All dish antennas greater than 36 inches in diameter shall be adequately
screened from adjoining properties by an opaque wall, fence, hedge or berm.
(iii) All loading areas shall be fully screened so as not to be visible from adjoining rights-of-way and
property zoned for any residential use.
(iv) All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials and products within 500 feet of a residential
district shall be effectively screened and enclosed by a solid wall or fence 8 feet in height. If
materials to be stored outdoors are in excess of 8 feet in height, then landscape screening shall be
provided in addition to the fence or wall installed along the outside perimeter of the fence or wall,
equal or exceeding the height of the materials to be stored outdoors.
b. Traffic Visibility. Landscaping must be designed and installed pursuant to Section 19.05.0201 on the
Village of Grafton Zoning Code.
c. Berming shall not exceed a maximum slope of 3:1 except in parking islands, where the maximum
slope shall not exceed 2:1.
d. Mulch materials shall be shredded bark or other organic material best suited for the Village of
Grafton. Gravel and stone mulches are not permitted, unless specifically approved in writing by the
Director of Planning and Development.
e. All fences proposed to be used to meet landscape requirements shall be comply with all municipal
codes.
C. LANDSCAPE PLAN AND DESIGN REVIEW
The following guidelines shall be considered in reviewing the design and implementation of landscape plans
in conjunction with review of site plans and special use permits.
1. Standards for Plant Materials. Materials planted in any development shall comply with the following

shall be a minimum 6 feet in height when installed.
(ii) Deciduous shrubs (other than dwarf varieties) shall be a minimum of 30 inches in height at time
of installation if used as a perimeter screen planting, and 24 inches in height for all other
installations. Dwarf varieties and plants normally measured by spread shall be a minimum of 18
inches in height/spread.
(iii) Ground cover shall be so planted and spaced that complete coverage can be obtained within two
years after date of installation. Only ground cover plants, flowers, sodded lawn and natural mulch
will be considered appropriate ground cover.
(iv) Flower beds and the use of native grasses is encouraged and shall be mass planted in acceptable
areas to create color, texture and interest.
d. Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining all landscaping shown on the approved
landscape plan throughout the life of the development. All dead plants shall be replaced with plants
which meet original requirements. No changes shall be permitted without the approval of the Director
of Planning and Development or his/her designee.
2. Guide for Landscape Planting. The plant materials recommended in Subsection (3) below have minimal
maintenance requirements. However, all landscape material must receive a certain degree of care,
especially during and immediately after planting. To protect an investment in new landscaping, proper
horticultural techniques should be followed. The following recommendations are provided as a guide for
planting based on current horticultural practice.
a. The best times for planting are early spring and early fall. Plants planted in the summer run the risk of
dehydration.
b. Plant trees and shrubs at least 3-feet from the back of curb along head-in parking spaces to prevent
damage from car overhangs. Mulch, lawn or planted ground cover shall be further help avoid damage.
c. Dig tree pits at least one foot wider than the root ball.
d. Especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil, the bottom of the pit should be
scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel.
e. After a pit is dug, observe subsurface drainage conditions. Where poor drainage exists, special
provisions should be made to ensure proper drainage around the tree.
f. Backfill should include a proper mix of soil, peat moss, and nutrients. All roots must be completely
covered. Backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots.
g. Plants should remain plumb and level. Newly planted trees may be supported with stakes and ties to
hold it firmly in place. Remove stakes and ties after one year.
h. Spread at least two inches of mulch over plant beds in order to retain moisture and keep down weeds.
A 3 inch deep saucer should be provided to form a basin around the trunk of the tree. This saucer
helps catch and retain moisture.
i. The lower trunks of new trees may be wrapped with burlap or paper to prevent evaporation and sun
scald. The wrapping should remain on the tree for at least one year.
3. Lists of Recommended Trees, Shrubs, Evergreen, and Ground Cover. The following lists indicate
plantings which will meet the landscape requirements of this Ordinance. The lists are by no means
comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for these
purposes. Plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to four principal criteria: (i) general
suitability for the climate and soil conditions of this area, (ii) ease of maintenance, (iii) tolerance of
Village conditions, and (iv) availability from area nurseries. All plantings shall be approved by the
Director of Planning and Development.

SECTION 19.05.0314 MITIGATION OF MINIMUM REQUIRED LANDSCAPE SURFACE RATIO (LSR) IN
NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
The Village of Grafton recognizes that the use of the landscape surface ratio (LSR) standards for the provision of adequately
landscaped open space in nonresidential areas as set forth in this Ordinance may not always lead to good design and, under
some circumstances, may be difficult to achieve. This Section addresses landscape mitigation measures that may be allowed
by the Plan Commission.
A. Mitigation of Required Bufferyards and Off-Street Parking Landscaping Not Permitted. The mitigation of the
dimensional requirements, structural requirements, and/or landscape plant unit and/or material requirements of
required peripheral or street bufferyards shall not be allowed. Landscape surface ratio (LSR) mitigation shall only be
allowed for required on-site landscaping as required in Table 19.05.0311(C).
B. Maximum Allowable Reduction of the Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR) Through Mitigation Measures. The
maximum allowable reduction of the landscape surface ratio (LSR) through mitigation measures shall not fall below
those landscape surface ratios (LSRs) set forth in Table 19.05.0314. In no case shall reductions in landscape
surface ratios (LSRs) supersede the natural resource protection standards set forth in Division 19.04.0100 or allow
for increases in either the maximum gross floor area ratio (GFAR) or net floor area ratio (NFAR) set forth in the
various zoning district requirements of this Ordinance.

activities upon adjoining residents or owners are minimized by design and installation of landscape
bufferyards to provide for appropriate screening, fencing, or landscaping as required in Division
19.05.0300 of this Ordinance. Where required, a "Landscape Plan" meeting the requirements set forth in
Division 19.06.0300 has also been submitted for Plan Commission review and approval.
I. Provision of Emergency Vehicle Accessibility. Land, buildings, and structures are readily accessible to
emergency vehicles and the handicapped.
J. Building Location. No building shall be permitted to be sited in a way that would unnecessarily destroy or
substantially damage the beauty of the area, particularly insofar as it would adversely affect values incident
to ownership of land in the area; or which would unnecessarily affect the beauty and general enjoyment of
existing structures on adjoining properties.
K. Location and Design of Loading Facilities. No loading facility shall be permitted to be designed or sited
in a way that would unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the beauty of the area, particularly
insofar as it would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in the area; or which would
unnecessarily affect the beauty and general enjoyment of the existing structures on adjoining properties.
L. Consistency with the Intent of the Village of Grafton Zoning Ordinance. The Site Plan is consistent
with the intent and purposes of the Village of Grafton Zoning Ordinance that are to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare; to encourage the use of lands according to their character and
adaptability; to avoid the overcrowding of population; to lessen congestion on the public roads and streets;

specified principles and standards required by this Ordinance with respect to the proposed use or
development, including Conditional Use Permit standards where applicable.
4. Interference with Easements or Public Rights-of-Way. The proposed site plan interferes with
easements or public rights-of-way.
5. Interference with Features. The proposed site plan unreasonably destroys, damages,
detrimentally modifies, or interferes with the enjoyment of significant natural resource,
topographical, or other physical features of the site.
6. Adverse Traffic Impacts. The proposed site plan creates undue traffic congestion or hazards in
the public streets, or the circulation elements of the proposed site plan unreasonably create hazards
to safety on or off site or disjointed, inefficient pedestrian or vehicular circulation paths on or off
site.
7. Inadequate Bufferyards or Screening. The bufferyards or screening of the site does not provide
adequate shielding from or for nearby uses.

SECTION 19.06.0402 PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW
In their consideration of applications for architectural review, the Building Inspector, Plan Commission, and
Architectural Review Board shall consider and evaluate the propriety of granting the approval in terms of the effect
of the application on the general purposes for which architectural approval is required. The following principles and
standards for architectural review are used by the Building Inspector, Plan Commission, and Architectural Review
Board (as applicable) in the review, approval or denial of the Architectural Review Application. These are also
intended to be a design aid for builders and owners to use in the preparation of architectural plans. A Building
Permit shall not be issued for any single-family residence, two-family residential structure, multiple-family
residential structure, or nonresidential building which does not meet the requirements of this Section. In addition,
no building or remodeling of a building which is located in the area subject to the Grafton Downtown Master Plan as
adopted by the Village of Grafton Plan Commission on February 23, 1999, shall be permitted unless said building or
proposed remodeling complies with the downtown master plan design guidelines included in that master plan. To
implement this Ordinance, the following architectural review principles and guidelines are established:
A. Residential Development (Single-Family Structures, Two-Family Structures, and Individual Lot
Plans for Such Structures).
1. General. No two (2) single-family dwellings or two-family dwellings of similar front elevation or
facade shall be repeated on any abutting lots or within five (5) lots on either side of the street on
which the dwellings front, including lots which are directly across the street from one another.
Front elevations or facades shall be deemed to be similar when there is no substantial difference in
roof lines; and no substantial change in windows of either size, location or type; and either no
change in the color of materials used (rather than a change in shade), or no substantial change in
the kind of materials except where such buildings are part of a unified development and similar
building designs are approved by a unanimous vote of the Architectural Review Board.
2. Roof Lines.
a. The following differences in the roof lines of single-family dwellings or two-family
dwellings as seen from the front of the dwelling shall be deemed sufficient to render
buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
19-6-13
(1) Changing gable roofs to hip roofs.
(2) Providing an intersecting gable roof on the main gable roof, if the height of the
intersecting roof is at least fifty (50) percent of the height of the main roof.
(3) Providing an intersecting hip roof on the main hip roof, if the height of the
intersecting hip roof is at least fifty (50) percent of the height of the main roof.
(4) Subject to review by the Building Inspector, a shed roof when used as a front
porch roof for a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the entire width of the house,
excluding area of the garage.
(5) Subject to review by the Building Inspector, a substantial difference in roof line
shall be deemed to exist if the front soffit is increased significantly and is
combined with columns at least six (6) inches in width or other architectural
features of a similar magnitude which reach the roof line of the highest story.
(6) Rotating gable roofs ninety (90) degrees on the building.
(7) On a tri-level residence or other building type that has three (3) independent
major roof areas, the changing of two (2) out of three (3) roof lines shall be
acceptable as a substantial change. Acknowledging certain design elements may
prevent the changing of all three (3) roof lines, it is desired that the roofs with
the greatest impact in the streetscape be changed.
b. The following changes shall not be deemed sufficient to make adjacent structures
dissimilar:
(1) A gable roof atop a hip roof.
(2) A hip roof atop a gable roof.
(3) Small gable or hip projections above windows.
(4) Window dormers.
(5) Change in soffit overhang or minor variation in eave height.

sufficient to render buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be
dissimilar:
(1) Changing from single windows to a multiple window arrangement (ganged
units).
(2) Changing from multiple window arrangement to single windows.
(3) Changing the type of windows (e.g., a casement to double hung).
(4) Providing a bay or bow window in the area of the predominant window.
b. The following change shall not be deemed sufficient to constitute a substantial change in
windows:
19-6-14
(1) The addition or subtraction of muntin bars (dividing lights).
c. Where, because of its size, location or design, one window is the predominant window on
the front elevation or face, if the size, location or type of that window is changed to
render the dwelling dissimilar, then no other window need be changed.
4. Construction Material or Color.
a. The following differences in construction material between adjacent single-family
dwellings or two-family dwellings as seen from the front of the dwellings shall be
deemed sufficient to render buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots
to be dissimilar.
(1) Four (4) inch exposure horizontal siding.
(2) Eight (8) inch exposure horizontal siding.
(3) Brick facing.
(4) Stone facing.
(5) Stucco/stucco to board and trim.
(6) When materials are changed, the change must occur throughout the front facade
or elevation for a minimum of one (1) story in height.
b. Color change shall be made by significant changes in adjacent colors. The change must
be one of color rather than merely of the shade.
B. Nonresidential Development and Multiple-Family Structures.
1. Building Scale and Mass. The size and mass of buildings and structures in relation to open
spaces, windows. door openings, porches, balconies, etc. shall be visually compatible with the
buildings, public ways, and places to which they are visually related. The relative proportion of a
building to its neighboring existing buildings, to pedestrians or observers, or to other existing
buildings shall be maintained or enhanced when new buildings are built or when existing
buildings are remodeled or altered.
2. Building Facade and Appurtenance Continuity. Building facades and appurtenances such as
walls, fences, and landscape masses shall, when it is a characteristic of the area, form cohesive
walls of enclosure along a street to ensure visual compatibility with the buildings, public ways,
and places to which such elements are visually related.
3. Building Height, Rooflines, and Roof Shapes. The height of the proposed buildings and
structures shall be visually compatible with adjacent buildings and do not exceed the zoning
district height requirements for both principal and accessory structures. The visual continuity of
roofs and their contributing elements (parapet walls, coping, cornices, etc.) shall be maintained in
building development or redevelopment.
4. Building Design Proportions. The following shall be used as guidelines for evaluating building
design proportions:
a. Proportion of Front Facade. The relationship of the width to the height of the front
elevation shall be visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and places to which it
is visually related.
19-6-15
b. Proportion of Openings. The relationship of the width to height of windows shall be
visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and places to which the building is
visually related.
c. Rhythm of Solids to Voids in Front Facades. The relationship of solids to voids in the
front facade of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and
places to which it is visually related.
d. Rhythm of Spacing and Buildings on Streets. The relationship of building or structure
to the open space between it and adjoining buildings or structures shall be visually
compatible with the buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually related.
e. Rhythm of Entrance, Porch, and Other Projections. The relationship of entrances and
other projections to sidewalks shall be visually compatible with the buildings, public
ways, and places to which it is visually related.
5. Directional Expression and Emphasis of Building Elevations. A building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually related in its
directional character, whether this be vertical character, horizontal character, or nondirectional
character.
6. Materials. Material selection for architectural design shall be based upon the prevailing material
already used on existing buildings in the area. No building shall be permitted where any exposed
facade is constructed or faced with a finished material that is aesthetically incompatible with other
building facades in the area or which presents an unattractive appearance to the public and
surrounding properties.
7. Colors. Since the selection of building colors has a significant aesthetic and visual impact upon
the public and neighboring properties, color shall be selected in general harmony with the existing
area or neighborhood buildings.
8. Design Repetition. A building design may not be repeated within four lots of an existing
building. This shall apply to all buildings, whether or not they are constructed by the same builder
except where such buildings are part of a unified development and similar building designs are
approved by a unanimous vote of the Architectural Review Board.
9. Story Distinctions. The first story of the building should be distinguished from the second story
by means of a horizontal lintel, second floor overhang or setback, or similar detail.
10. Elevations of Buildings Facing the Public Streets on a Corner Lot. Buildings on corner lots
shall continue the major front elevation design elements around the corner elevation.
11. Building Elevations Clad with a Singular Exterior Surface Material. Building elevations clad
with a singular exterior surface material shall provide some additional architectural design
element(s) to break up the plane of the wall. This may be done by the addition of window(s),
gable end wall treatments, siding design and accent panels, or other architectural design treatments
consistent with the principal building design.
12. Foundations Below Overhanging Bays. Buildings shall be designed with foundations below all
bays that overhang the building foundation. The Architectural Review Board will allow the
construction of bay windows, projections of floors above the first floor, if they are a minimum of
twelve (12) inches above grade.

constructed of materials similar to those materials used on the building elevations; metal housings
designed by the vent manufacturer to enclose the chimney vents are acceptable.
19-6-16
14. Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Equipment (Building Mounted). All buildingmounted
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment or changes to existing heating,
ventilating, and/or air-conditioning equipment shall be designed so as to be integral with the
building architecture and screened from view from public rights-of-way.
15. Garages and Loading Docks. Garages and loading docks shall be designed as integral elements
to the building and site, and shall not be the dominant visual element from public rights-of-way.
All loading docks shall be completely screened from view from public rights-of-way.
16. Design Standards in Comprehensive Plan. The Architectural Review Board shall refer to the
Village's Comprehensive Plan or components thereof for building design recommendations for
specific neighborhoods, districts, or building types. No building or remodeling of a building
which is located in the area subject to the Grafton Downtown Master Plan, as adopted by the
Village of Grafton Plan Commission on February 23, 1999, shall be permitted unless said building
or proposed remodeling complies with the design guidelines included within that master plan.
This provision shall also apply to the location, installation, relocation, reconstruction, extension ,
enlargement, conversion, or structural alteration of exterior signage in the area subject to said
Master Plan. (Ord. 008, Series 2001, Part 22; Ord. 041, Series 2000, Part 4)
17. Design Standards for Retail and Commercial Service Buildings Over 20,000 Gross Square
Feet in Area. All commercial service buildings over twenty thousand (20,000) gross square feet
in area shall meet the additional design requirements set forth in Section 19.03.0703(P).

SECTION 19.07.0103 APPLICATIONS FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
A. General. It is recognized that there are uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular zoning district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses
upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such conditional uses
fall into two categories:
1. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest.
2. Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique
problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
B. Initiation of Conditional Uses. Any person owning or having an interest in the subject property may file an
application to use such land for one (1) or more of the conditional uses provided for in this Ordinance and in the
zoning district in which the land is situated, but in addition:
1. An existing or potential lessee of all or part of the land may also file an application for a conditional use
permit, provided that the application also includes written correspondence from the property owner indicating his or
her consent. (Ord. 008, Series 2001, Part 25).
2. A person may file concurrent applications for a conditional use permit and a zoning ordinance amendment
that would establish the desired use as an allowable conditional use on the subject property, or may file an
application for a conditional use subject to Village approval of a pending zoning ordinance amendment. However,
the applicant shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees or charges associated with the conditional use permit
application if the Village Board does not approve the proposed or pending zoning ordinance amendment. (Ord. 008,
Series 2001, Part 25).
C. Application for Conditional Uses. A Conditional Use Permit application for a Conditional Use, or for the
expansion of an existing conditional use, shall be filed with the Village Clerk (or other Village Board authorized
agent) on a Conditional Use Permit application form prescribed by the Village Clerk (or other Village Board
authorized agent). The Conditional Use Permit application shall be accompanied by a legal description of the
property for which a Conditional Use Permit is being applied for, such plans or data prescribed on the application
form, a statement in writing by the applicant, and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use will
conform to the standards set forth in Division 19.03.0700 of this Ordinance and those other standards set forth in this
Ordinance that may also be applicable.
D. Hearing on Conditional Use Application. Upon receipt in proper form of the application and statement referred to
above, the Plan Commission shall hold at least one (1) public hearing. A notice of public hearing shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village of Grafton as a Class 2 legal notice, as defined in Wisconsin
Statutes Chapter 985. Due notice shall also be given to property owners of properties located within two hundred
(200) feet of the affected property and all property under the same ownership. The Village Clerk (or other Village
Board authorized agent) shall set the date for the public hearing(s). (Ordinance No. 005, Series 2004, Part 2)
19- 7 - 4
E. Authorization of Conditional Uses. For each application for a Conditional Use Permit, the Plan Commission shall
make its decision based upon its findings. In addition the Plan Commission shall have the ability to include the
stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are
deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. The Plan Commission may grant or deny any application
for a Conditional Use Permit. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 2)
F. Effect of Denial of a Conditional Use Permit. No application for a Conditional Use Permit which has been denied
wholly or in part by the Plan Commission shall be resubmitted for thirty (30) days from the date of said order of
denial. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 2)
G. Revocation. In any case where a conditional use has not been established within one (1) year after the date of
granting thereof, then without further action by the Plan Commission, the Conditional Use Permit shall be null and
void. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, Part 2)
H. Annual Review of Conditional Use Permits. All Conditional Use Permits shall be reviewed on an annual basis by
the Zoning Administrator for their continued compliance with all conditions of approval. If any Conditional Use
Permit granted is found be in violation of any conditions of its approval, said Conditional Use Permit shall be
referred by the Zoning Administrator to the Plan Commission for potential revocation. (Ord. 005, Series 2004, part
2)
SECTION 19.07.0104 APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
A. When a Certificate of Occupancy is Required. A Certificate of Occupancy to be issued by the Building Inspector

residences:
1. Occupancy and use of a building hereafter erected or enlarged.
2. Change in use of an existing building.
3. Any change in the use of a nonconforming use.
B. No Occupancy, Use, or Change of Use Shall Take Place. No such occupancy, use, or change of use shall take
place until a Certificate of Occupancy therefore shall have been issued and the requirements of both this Ordinance
and Title 16 "Buildings and Construction" of the Village of Grafton Municipal Code have been met.
C. Site Plan Approval Required for Certificate of Occupancy.
1. If a Site Plan is a requirement of a zoning district, no person shall commence any use or erect any structure
or obtain a Building Permit without first obtaining the approval of a Site Plan by the Plan Commission as
set forth in this Ordinance, and no use shall be carried on, no structure erected or enlarged and no other
improvement or construction undertaken except as shown on approved Site Plan. The remodeling of the
interior of existing structures is exempt from the requirements of this Section.
2. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be granted until all improvements shown on a Plan Commission
approved Site Plan and Landscape Plan have been completed in accordance therewith; provided, that upon
a finding by the Building Inspector that certain improvements cannot be completed due to seasonal or other
factors beyond the control of the developer, and that temporary occupancy prior to the completion will
involve no health or safety hazard, the Building Inspector may issue a temporary Certificate of Occupancy
bearing an expiration date, which date shall allow reasonable time for completion, upon posting a surety in
conformance with the requirements of Section 19.06.0105 of this Ordinance to the Village Finance
Director, in double the sum estimated by the Building Inspector to be needed to complete all required
improvements, conditioned on completion of all required improvements prior to the date of expiration of

Ordinance; is in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, and elements thereof, for community
development; is in conformity with, or serves to implement, the appropriate detailed planning district or
neighborhood unit development plan, including amendments thereto; would not be contrary to the general
welfare and economic prosperity of the Village or the immediate neighborhood; and that the benefits and
improved design of the resultant development justifies the establishment of a PUD District.
3. Common Open Space. Common open space consisting of land unoccupied by nonrecreational structures,
buildings, streets, rights-of-way, minimum required lot areas, and automobile parking lots and designed and
intended for the use and enjoyment of residents of a PUD District shall be provided in each PUD District.

light of existing and proposed uses of a similar nature in the area, and the need to provide or maintain a
proper mix of uses within the Village and within the immediate area of the proposed use. The Plan
Commission shall not recommend Village Board approval of any PUD District unless it can find that the

1) Amount, Location, and Use of Open Space. The failure of a proposed PUD District to
provide adequate open space shall be considered an indication that it has not satisfied the
objectives for which such PUD District developments may be approved pursuant to this
Ordinance. When open space is provided in a PUD District, the amount and location of
such open space shall be consistent with its intended function as set forth in this
Ordinance, the application, and PUD District plans. No such open space shall be used for
the construction of any structure or improvement except such structures and
improvements as may be approved by the Village as appropriate to the intended leisure
and recreational uses for which such open space is intended.
2) Preservation of Open Space Required. Adequate safeguards, including recorded
covenants and deed restrictions, shall be provided to prevent the subsequent use of open
space for any use, structure, improvement, or development other than that shown on the
Village approved PUD District plans. The covenants and restrictions must be permanent,
not be for a given period of years, and must run with the land. Such covenants and deed
restrictions may provide that they may be released, but only with the approval of the
Village Board.

or are not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interests of the subject PUD
District or the Village.
4) Property Owners' Association. When the requirements of the preceding subparagraph
3) above are to be satisfied by the ownership or maintenance of such open space or
improvements by a property owners' association, such association shall meet each of the
following standards:

in violation of the requirements of this Ordinance.
b) That the property owners' association must be established and all declarations,
covenants, and deed restrictions must be recorded before the sale of any
property within the area of the PUD District designated to have the exclusive
use of the proposed open space or improvements.
c) That the property owners' association must be responsible for casualty and
liability insurance, taxes, and the maintenance of the open space and
improvements to be deeded to the property owners' association.
d) That membership in the property owners' association must be mandatory for
each property owner of the PUD District and any successive property owner
having a right to the use or enjoyment of such open space or improvements.
e) That every property owner having a right to the use or enjoyment of such open
space or improvements must pay its pro rata share of the cost of the property
owners' association by means of an assessment to be levied by the property
owners' association that meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the
property according to the State statutes.
f) That the property owners' association must have the right to adjust the
assessment to meet changed needs. The membership vote of the property
owners' association required to authorize such adjustment shall not be fixed at
more than two-thirds of the property owners' association members voting on the
issue.
g) The Village must be given the right, after ten (10) days' written notice to the
property owners' association, to perform any maintenance or repair work that the
property owners' association has neglected to perform, to assess the property
owners' association membership for such work and to have a lien against the
property of any member failing to pay such assessment. For this purpose alone,
the Village shall have all the rights and powers of the property owners'
association and its governing body under the agreements and declarations
creating the property owners' association.
d. Landscaping and Perimeter Treatment Required. Any area of a PUD District not used for
structures or circulation elements shall be landscaped meeting all landscaping provisions of this
Ordinance or otherwise improved according to the provisions of this Ordinance. The perimeter of
the PUD District shall be treated to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses by means such as
the provision of compatible uses and structures, setbacks, screening, or natural or manmade
bufferyards.
e. Private Streets and/or Drives. If recommended by the Plan Commission and approved by the
Village Board, private streets may be allowed. If so approved, such private streets and/or drive
shall meet all Village construction standards for private streets and/or drives. No such private
streets and/or drives shall be approved except upon the condition that they shall be owned and
maintained by a property owners' association meeting the requirements set forth in this Section.

b. Architectural Design. The extent to which the design and architecture of buildings and other
structures on the site are compatible with nearby developments considering such elements, as
scale, height, and mass; proportion and directional expression of facades; spacing and relation

19.06.0400 of this Ordinance provides further guidelines for the review of architectural design.
(Ord. 008, Series 2001, Part 26).
c. Landscaping, Streetscape, and Bufferyards. Landscaping shall be integrated into building
arrangements, topography, off-street parking, and bufferyard requirements. Landscaping shall
include trees, bushes, shrubs, ground cover, perennials, annuals, plant sculpture, open area, and the
use of building and paving materials in an imaginative manner. Bufferyard shall be located
around the perimeter of the site to minimize the off-site impacts of headlight glare, noise, light
from structures and open areas and the movement of people and vehicles. Bufferyard may consist
of fencing, evergreens, shrubs, bushes, deciduous trees, or combinations thereof to achieve the
intent of the PUD District. Division 19.05.0300 of this Ordinance provides further guidelines for
the review of landscaping and bufferyards.
d. Signs. Signs shall be designed to be aesthetically pleasing, harmonious with other signs on the
site, and located to achieve their purpose without constituting hazards to vehicles and pedestrians.

within and adjacent to the site shall be safe and efficient with particular emphasis on the provision
and layout of sufficient parking areas, off-street loading and unloading, and the safe and efficient
movement of people, goods, and vehicles from access streets, within the site, and between
buildings and vehicles. Adequate provisions shall be made to provide ingress and egress so
designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. The proposed site shall be
accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them
by the proposed development. A traffic study prepared by a Traffic Safety Engineer may be
required as determined by the Plan Commission. Off-street parking spaces and areas are to be
usable and conveniently arranged. Access to the site from adjacent roads shall be designed so as
to interfere as little as possible with traffic flow on these roads and to permit vehicles, including
emergency vehicles, a rapid and safe ingress and egress to the site. The streets and driveways on
the site of the proposed development shall be adequate to serve the residents of the proposed
development and shall meet the minimum standards of all applicable ordinances of the Village.
g. Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided to ensure safe movement of persons and vehicles
and for security purposes. Directional lights shall be arranged to minimize glare and reflection on
adjacent properties. Lighting standards shall be a type approved by the Plan Commission based,

Commission may recommend to the Village Board the designation of historic structures and historic sites,
or recission of such designation, after application of the criteria set forth in Chapter 2.35 of the Grafton
Municipal Code. (Ord. 025, Series 2008, Part 8).
19-7 - 1 8
2. Public Hearing and Village Board Action On Historic Structures and Historic Sites. The Village
Board, upon receipt of the recommendation from the Historic Preservation Commission for the designation
of historic structures and historic sites, or the recission of such designation, shall hold a public hearing.
The Village Clerk (or other Village Board authorized agent) shall set the date for the public hearing(s). At
least ten (10) days before such public hearing, the Village Clerk (or other authorized agent) shall notify the
owners of record, as listed in the office of the Village Assessor, who are owners of property in whole or in
part lying immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the property affected. Said notification shall be via
regular mail. The Village Board may hear expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such
witnesses and records as it deems necessary. After the public hearing, the Village Board may designate the
property as either a historic structure, or a historic site, or rescind the designation. No designation shall be
made without the consent of the property owner or property owners of record title. After the designation or
rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to the property owner or owners. Notification shall also
be given to the Village Clerk (or other Village Board authorized agent), Building Inspection Department,
Plan Commission, and the Village Assessor. The Village Board shall cause the designation or rescission of
historic structures and historic sites to be recorded, at the owners expense, in the Ozaukee County Register
of Deeds Office. (Ord. 001, Series 2005, part 1)
B. Creation of HPO District. For preservation purposes, the Historic Preservation Commission shall select
geographically defined areas within the Village to be designated by the Village Board as HPO Districts and shall
prepare a historic preservation plan for each such designated area. An HPO District may be designated for any
geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the Village, after application of the
criteria set forth in Chapter 2.35 of the Grafton Municipal Code. Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by
the Historic Preservation Commission for an HPO District shall include a cultural and architectural analysis
supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development, and a statement of
preservation objectives. (Ord. 025, Series 2008, Part 8).
1. Historic Preservation Commission to Recommend Designation of HPO Districts to Village Board.
The Historic Preservation Commission may recommend to the Village Board the designation of HPO
Districts, or recission of such designations, after application of the criteria set forth in Chapter 2.35 of the
Grafton Municipal Code. (Ord. 025, Series 2008, Part 8).

District or are situated in whole or in part within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the proposed
HPO District. Said notice is to be sent at least ten (10) days before the date of the public hearing.
Following the public hearing, the Village Board shall either designate or reject the HPO District. No
designation or rescission of a designation of individual properties within the HPO District shall be made
without the consent of the property owner or property owners of record title. Designation of the HPO
District shall constitute adoption of the plan prepared for that HPO District and direct the implementation
of said plan.
C. Interim Control. No Building Permit shall be issued by the Building Inspector for exterior alteration, construction,
demolition, or removal of a nominated historic structure, historic site, or any property or structure within a
nominated HPO District from the date of the meeting of the Historic Preservation Commission at which a
nomination form is first presented until the final disposition of the nomination by the Historic Preservation
Commission and Village Board action unless such alteration, removal or demolition is authorized by formal
resolution of the Village Board as necessary for public health, welfare, or safety. In no event shall the delay due to
determination of final disposition of the nomination for said Building Permit issuance be for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days.
19-7 - 1 9
D. Regulation of Construction, Reconstruction, Alteration and Demolition.
1. Certificate of Appropriateness Required. No owner or person in charge of a historic structure, historic
site or structure within a HPO District shall reconstruct, alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of
such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or cause or permit
any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish such property unless a Certificate of
Appropriateness has been granted by the Historic Preservation Commission. Also, unless such Certificate
of Appropriateness has been granted by the Historic Preservation Commission, the Building Inspector shall
not issue a permit for any such work.
2. Certificate of Appropriateness Approval. Upon filing of any application and applicable fee for a
Certificate of Appropriateness with the Historic Preservation Commission, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall approve the application unless:
a. For a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change,
destroy or adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which said work is
to be done;
b. For the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site, or within a HPO District, the
exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external
appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district;
c. For any property in a HPO District, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration
or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this section and to the objectives and
design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said HPO District;
d. The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition
would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the
Village and state;
e. For a request for the demolition of a deteriorated building or structure, any economic hardship or
difficulty claimed by the owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to maintain the
property in good repair.
3. Consistency with the Character and Features of the Property or the HPO District. If the Historic
Preservation Commission determines that the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness and the
proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or HPO District, it shall
issue the Certificate of Appropriateness. The Historic Preservation Commission shall make this decision
within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the application.
4. Other Permits and Approvals Required. The issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not
relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the Village. A Building
Permit or other municipal permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the Certificate
of Appropriateness required for the proposed work.
5. Maintenance and Repairs. Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a Certificate of
Appropriateness if the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the
replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance and if the work does not change
the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a Building Permit.
6. Appeals. In addition, if the Historic Preservation Commission fails to issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work
with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness within the guidelines of this
Ordinance. Should the Historic Preservation Commission fail to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness due
to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines set forth in this Ordinance, the applicant may
appeal such decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals per Section 19.07.0107 of this Ordinance.
19-7 - 2 0
E. Recognition of Historic Structures, Sites and HPO Districts. When a historic structure, site or HPO District has
been properly designated, the Historic Preservation Commission, in cooperation with the property owner, may cause
to be prepared and erected on such property at the Villages expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property
is a historic structure, site or HPO District.

acknowledged by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of the land immediately adjacent extending one hundred (100)
feet therefrom, or by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of the land directly opposite thereto extending one hundred
(100) feet from the street frontage of such opposite land, such changes or amendments shall not become effective except by
the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the full Village Board membership voting on the proposed change.
SECTION 19.07.0212 SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS, ZONING
DISTRICT CHANGE, OR AMENDMENT TO THE ZONING REGULATIONS
A. Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred. Whenever any application filed for a Conditional use
Permit, zoning district change, or amendment to the zoning regulations pursuant to this Ordinance has been finally
denied on its merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the same form or on
the same theory, shall not be brought unless in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, Village Board, or Plan
Commission before which it is brought there is substantial new evidence available or a mistake of law or fact
significantly affected the prior denial.
B. New Grounds to Be Stated. Any such second application shall include a detailed statement of the grounds
justifying consideration of such application.
C. Summary Denial With or Without Hearing. Any such second application may be denied by the Zoning
Administrator summarily, and without hearing, on a finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In
any case where such application is set for hearing, the applicant shall be required to establish grounds warranting
reconsideration of the merits of its application before being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless
such grounds are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such failure unless approved by a
two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Plan Commission.
D. Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second application filed more than eighteen (18)
months after the final denial of a prior application shall be heard on the merits. The applicant shall, however, be
required to place in the record all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have
developed since the denial of the first application. Without such evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts
exist to support the new petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.
E. Appeal of Decisions Made to Dismiss Applications. Decisions made to dismiss applications based upon this
Section may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
DIVISION 19.07.0300 ZONING ADMINISTRATIVE FEES

"Fee Schedule," and at the times specified by Title 3 "Revenues and Finances" of the Village of Grafton Municipal Code,
before being entitled to any approvals or permits. No application filed pursuant to this Ordinance shall be considered
complete unless and until all fees due pursuant to this Ordinance have been paid. Every approval granted and every permit
issued pursuant to this Ordinance, whether or not expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned upon payment
of the required fees. The failure to pay any such fee fully when due shall be grounds for the Village of Grafton to refuse to
process, or to continue to process, an application and to deny or revoke any permit or approval sought or issued with respect
to the land or development to which the unpaid fee(s) relate.

1. Variances (except Minor Variances). No variance to the provisions of this Ordinance (except as
otherwise provided) shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals unless it finds that if the
variance is granted it would not be contrary to the public interest; a literal enforcement of the
Ordinance provisions would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship due to special
conditions; the spirit of the Ordinance is preserved; public safety and welfare are secured and
substantial justice done. In reviewing the application and evidence relating to a variance the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the findings statements set forth in Section 19.08.0209 of
this Ordinance.
2. Minor Variances. No minor variances to the provisions of this ordinance or the building code
shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals unless it finds by a preponderance of the
evidence, considering the interests of the abutting and opposite property owners and the public
that there exist conditions under which a literal enforcement of the building codes and zoning
regulations of this Ordinance as to the subject structure would result in a substantial burden to the
19- 8-4
appellant or applicant and no material impact upon the community, so that the spirit and purpose of such
regulations be observed and the safety, welfare and health of the public and the abutting and opposite property
owners be protected. In reviewing the application and evidence relating to a minor variance, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the following factors and indicate its findings in the
minutes of the proceedings:
a. The change sought by the minor variation shall be consistent with the intent of the zoning
regulations for the district in which the property is located;
b. Minor variances shall not create substantial detriment to or materially impair adjacent
property;
c. The Zoning Board of Appeals may consider such other factors that appear relevant to the
grant or denial of the minor variance.
D. Authorized Variances. Variances from the regulations of this Ordinance shall be granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals only according to the standards established in this Section, and may be granted only in
the following instances and in no others:
1. To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback required by the applicable regulations
(except as limited by Section 19.02.0203(C) of this Ordinance for corner lot setbacks.);
2. To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area
or width of the lot or lots, but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be
less than ninety (90) percent of the required area and width (except as limited by Section
19.02.0205(B) of this Ordinance.);
3. To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities for two (2) or more
uses, provided the substantial use of such facility by each user does not take place at
approximately the same hours of the same days of the week;
4. To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not more than one (1)
parking space or loading space or twenty (20) percent of the applicable regulations, whichever
number is greater;
5. To increase by not more than twenty five (25) percent the maximum distance that required parking
spaces are permitted to be located from the use served;
6. To increase by not more than ten (10) percent the maximum gross floor area of any use so limited
by the applicable regulations;
7. To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this Section, when a lot of record or a
zoning lot, vacant or legally used on the effective date of this Ordinance, is by reason of the
exercise of the right of eminent domain by any authorized governmental body or by reason of a
nonconveyance under threat of an eminent domain proceeding reduced in size so that the
remainder of said lot of record or zoning lot or structure of said lot does not conform with one (1)
or more of the regulations of the district in which said lot of record or zoning lot or structure is
located.
SECTION 19.08.0107 INTERPRETATIONS
A. General. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Zoning Administrator may be taken to the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
B. Standards for Use Interpretations. The following standards shall govern both the Zoning Administrator
19- 8-5
and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals from the Zoning Administrator in issuing use interpretations:
1. No use interpretation shall be given with respect to the residential zoning districts.
2. Any use defined in either Divisions 19.03.0600 or 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance shall be
interpreted as therein defined.
3. No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use or a conditional use in any district
to be established in any zoning district in which such use is not so listed.
4. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be presented that
shows that it will comply with each use limitation established for that particular district.
5. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is substantially
similar to other uses permitted in such district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses
permitted or specially permitted in a more restrictive district.
6. If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a conditional use in the district in
which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation permitting such use shall be
conditioned upon the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit for such use pursuant to Divisions
19.03.0700 and 19.09.0100 of this Ordinance.
7. No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with the
district intent statement of the district in question.
8. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitation, as set forth in this Section, in rendering use
interpretations the Zoning Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals shall be guided by the SIC
use classification system and methodology described herein.
9. No interpretation shall have the effect of amending, abrogating, or waiving any other standard or
requirement established by this Ordinance.
C. Effect of Favorable Use Interpretations. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
specially permitted in a particular district shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that
may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village of Grafton including, but not limited to Zoning
Permit, Conditional Use Permit, Building Permit, or any other required permit.
D. Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. Limitations on favorable use interpretations are as
follows:
1. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals, no use interpretation
finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall be valid
for a period longer than six (6) months from the date of issue unless a Building Permit is issued
and construction is actually begun within the six (6) month period and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion, or a Zoning Permit or Conditional Use Permit is obtained and a use
commenced within that period.
2. A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular
district shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued, and such
permit shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use
interpretation has not been issued. Such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any
force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued
for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months or more.

the date, time, place of such hearing, and the matter to be presented at the hearing by publication in the
Village of a Class 2 notice under Chapter 985 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Notice of the public hearing shall

SECTION 19.08.0109 FINDINGS
No variance to the provisions of this Ordinance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals unless it finds
beyond a reasonable doubt that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its
proceedings.
A. Preservation of Intent. No variance shall be granted that is not consistent with the purpose and intent of
the regulations for the district in which the development is located. No variance shall permit a use in any
district that is not a stated permitted use, accessory use, or conditional use in that particular district.
B. Exceptional Circumstances. There must be exceptional, extraordinary, or unusual circumstances or
conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use, or intended use that do not apply generally to other
properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general or
recurrent nature as to suggest that the Zoning Ordinance should be changed.
C. Economic Hardship and Self-Imposed Hardship Not Grounds for Variance. No variance shall be
granted solely based on economic gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as grounds
for the granting of the variance.

substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same vicinity.
