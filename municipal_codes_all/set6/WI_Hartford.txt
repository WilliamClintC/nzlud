is to establish a City records retention schedule and authorize destruction of City records
pursuant to the schedule on an annual basis. Records custodians may destroy a record prior to
the time set forth in the schedule only if such a record has been photographically reproduced
as an original record, microfilmed, or converted to optical disk format pursuant to sec. 16.61 (7)
Wis. Stats.
Any record not covered by this ordinance or any regulation or law shall be retained 7
years and unless a shorter time period is approved by the State Public Records and Forms
Board.

i. "Legal Custodian" means the individual responsible for maintaining
records pursuant to Section 19.33 Wis. Stats. In accordance with
subsection (1) of sec. 19.33 Wis. Stats. and, pursuant to subsection 1) of
this ordinance, the City Clerk or Deputy Clerk, in the City Clerk's absence,
has been designated the legal custodian.
ii. "Record" has the meaning defined in Section 19.32 (2), Wis. Stats., and it
shall have that meaning wherever it appears in Section 4.29 of this code.

Society of Wisconsin. Destruction of records shall be in accord with sec.

previously waived the required statutory 60 day notice for any record
designated as "waived" (i.e., notice waived) in a Retention Schedule
which shall be maintained, and kept current, by the City Clerk. The State
Historical Society of Wisconsin must be notified by the City Clerk or
department head prior to destruction of any record designated in said
Retention Schedule with "Notify" (i.e., notice not waived). Those records
listed in the Retention Schedule as "N/A" (not applicable) are permanent
records, never to be destroyed. This categorization applies to any record
designated for permanent retention with the original custodian. Notice
to the State Historical Society of Wisconsin is also required for any record
not listed in said Retention Schedule.
4-18
2. Microfilming or Optical Imaging of Records. Public records may
be preserved through the use of microfilm or optical imaging
provided the applicable standards in sec. 16.61 (7), Wis. Stats.,
(microfilm) and sec. 16.612, Wis. Stats., (optical imaging) are met.
Retention periods, estimated costs and benefits of converting
records between different media, and approved budgets are to be
considered in deciding which records to microfilm or store in
optical disk format. After verification, records converted to
microfilm or optical imaging may be destroyed. The retention
periods identified in this ordinance apply to records in any media.
3. Destruction After Request for Inspection. In accord with sec.
19.35 (5), Wis. Stats., no records requested for inspection may be
destroyed until after the request for inspection is granted or 60
days after the request is denied. If any action is commenced by
the State Historical Society of Wisconsin under Sec. 19.37, Wis.
Stats., the requested record may not be destroyed until after a
court order is issued and all appeals have been completed.
4. Destruction Pending Litigation. No record subject to pending
litigation shall be destroyed until the litigation is resolved, and all
applicable appeal time limits have expired.
5. Review and Approval by Public Records and Forms Board. This
ordinance and the retention periods of less than 7 years have
been reviewed and approved by the Public Records and Forms
Board prior to enactment by the Common Council.
5) Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are severable. If a section,
subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase shall be adjudged by a court with competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
this ordinance.

Common Council of the City of Hartford for the granting of a franchise, the person making the

Municipal Code to cover the costs of printing and other expenses for which the City may

permit the Airport Manager to determine whether such use would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the Airport Manager shall issue the
permit applied for.
(b) Existing Uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced, altered, or
rebuilt, a permit shall be applied for and secured in the manner prescribed by paragraph (a)
authorizing such change, replacement or repair. No such permit shall be denied if the structure
will not become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this
chapter, or than it was when the application for permit was made.
10.08 APPEALS AND REVIEW. (a) Aggrieved Person. Any person aggrieved or
affected by any decision or action of the Airport Manager made in his administration of this
chapter may appeal such decision or action to the Public Works Committee.
(b) Variances. Upon appeal in special cases the Public Works Committee may, after
investigation and public hearing, grant such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
chapter would result in unnecessary hardship, and such relief will do substantial justice and be in
accord with the spirit of this chapter, and does not create a hazard to the safe, normal operation
of aircraft.
10-3
(c) Procedure. Any appeal taken pursuant to this section shall be in conformity with the
procedure established by Section 62.23 (7) (3) of the Statutes.

costs of prosecution, shall be imprisoned in the county jail until said forfeiture and costs are paid,
but not to exceed thirty days for each violation. Each day that a violation continues to exist shall
constitute a separate offense. (AMENDED 6/11/96-- ORDINANCE NO. E-335)
10.10 SEVERABILITY. If any of the provisions of this chapter or the application
thereof to any persons or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other
provisions or applications of the chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision
or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.

requirements shall be adhered to:
1) Rules of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources relating to water quality and

within an existing city or village where transportation routes and services will minimize the
impact of commuting automobile traffic on City residents and where the full range of urban
services and facilities will be available. Within a recognized urban service area, those
subdivisions that could provide adequate public facilities and public services would be
favored. Subdivisions shall conform to the following policies:
a) To preserve and enhance the existing cities and villages and encourage compact balanced
growth shared by and in association with all the region’s cities and villages.
b) To encourage the development of balanced compact communities in Washington and
Dodge Counties with appropriate commercial, public services, industrial, employment,

services and facilities to be provided as economically and efficiently as possible.
g) To discourage new developments in those areas that are premature in terms of planning
and timing for the provision of adequate public services and facilities.
h) To preserve high quality agricultural lands for that purpose when located in an area
designated for preservation.
i) To prohibit development in areas or forms where substantial problems will result from
excessive automobile traffic volume.
j) To favor land use intensities and patterns that is supportive of alternative modes of
transportation.
8) A preliminary plat or final plat of any subdivision shall not be approved unless the Plan
Commission and the Common Council determine that adequate public facilities and public
services are available to support and service the area of the proposed subdivision, except as
provided hereinafter for certain land divisions and subdivisions located within the
extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction. In considering the questions of adequacy of public
facilities and public services as set forth above, the Plan Commission and Common Council
shall consider but not be limited to:
a) The nature, extent and size of the proposed subdivision and its impact in terms of the
estimated increase in population expected to result;
b) The present or projected state of development likely to result when said subdivision is
developed with projected densities as anticipated by adopted area Master Plans and
currently approved subdivisions in the immediate vicinity of the proposed
subdivision; and
c) The avoidance of expenditures of public funds necessitated by the proposed
subdivision which are not in adopted capital or operating budgets. For subdivisions in
the City, the applicant shall furnish data requested by the City Engineer, Hartford
Electric, Water Utility Manager, and Director of Planning and Zoning who will
coordinate statements of adequacy for transportation, electric service, storm sewer,
sanitary sewer, water service, fire and police protection, parks, open space, and
recreation and school facilities for the Plan Commission and the Common Council.
For subdivisions in the extraterritorial area where the City has a Comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance with the Town in which the proposed subdivision or land division
resides, the applicant shall include with the application for subdivision approval, a
statement evaluating and demonstrating compliance with the provisions of this
section to be reviewed by City departments and forwarded with appropriate
comments to the Plan Commission and Common Council. Public facilities and public
services may be determined adequate for a proposed subdivision when the following
conditions are found to exist:
i) The proposed subdivision shall be deemed adequately accessible via roads and
public transportation facilities if any of the following conditions are present:
(1) Existing roads are adequate to accommodate the traffic that would be
generated by the subject subdivision in addition to existing traffic and are
publicly maintained all weather roads; or
(2) Such additional roads or road improvements necessary in combination with
existing roads to accommodate the additional traffic that would be generated
by the subject subdivision are budgeted in the current adopted budget for
construction with public or private financing; or
12-4 
(3) In its determination of the adequacy of transportation to accommodate traffic,
the Plan Commission and Common Council shall consider the
recommendation of the Department of Transportation, the applicable levels of
traffic service, peak hour use and average use, and any other information
presented.
ii) The proposed subdivision shall be determined to have adequate storm sewer when
the City Engineer certifies to the Plan Commission and the Common Council that
adequate funds, either public or private, are available to assure the installation of
storm sewers meeting the standards of the Hartford Public Works Committee or,
in the event of other units of government, standards that are comparable to those
established by the Hartford Public Works Committee for a storm sewer and
drainage facilities.
iii) The proposed subdivision shall be determined to have adequate sanitary sewerage
facilities if located within an area in which main line interceptor sewer service is
presently available, under construction, or designated by the Common Council for
extension of sewer service within the current capital budget year and funds are
specifically provided for such extension either from public or private financing. In
its determination of the adequacy of sewerage service, the Plan Commission and
Common Council shall consider the recommendation of the City Engineer, the
capacity of trunk lines and sewerage treatment facilities and any other information
presented.
iv) The proposed subdivision shall be deemed to have adequate water service if the
following conditions are met:
(1) It is located within the urban service area prescribed by the Common Council,
and
(2) It is contiguous to an arterial transmission water main of adequate capacity for
the increased supply necessary or if the water distribution system that is
needed is under construction or scheduled by the Common Council for
installation within the current budget year and funds, either private or public,
are available for such program. In its determination of the adequacy of water
service, the Plan Commission and Common Council shall consider the
recommendation of the Hartford Water Utility, the capacity of distribution
lines, water sources, water storage facilities and any other information
presented.
v) The proposed subdivision shall be deemed to have adequate fire protection and
police service when it can be demonstrated that police or fire services are so
situated that adequate and timely service can be provided so as not to involve
danger or injury to health, safety or general welfare to the future residents of the
proposed subdivision. In its determination of the adequacy of police and fire
services, the Plan Commission and the Common Council shall consider the
recommendations of the Hartford Police and Fire Departments.
vi) The proposed subdivision shall be deemed to have adequate parks, open space
and recreation when it can be demonstrated that the future residents of the
proposed subdivision will have such park, open space and recreation services and
facilities available to them as are established by the standards in the most recently
adopted plan for Park and Open Spaces by the City.
vii)The proposed subdivision shall be deemed to have adequate school facilities when
the school district in which such proposed subdivision will be located upon its
development, provides information that adequate classroom space is either
available within the normal walk-in service area or that adequate transportation as
12-5 
normally provided by the school district can be provided to elementary through
high schools that have sufficient classroom space to provide for the anticipated
school age children in the proposed subdivision. If the School District fails to
comment, school facilities shall be presumed to be adequate.
Where the City determines that one or more public facilities or public services are not
adequate for the full development proposed, but that a portion of the area could be
served adequately, or careful phasing of the development could result in all public
facilities or public services being adequate, conditional approval may include only
such portions, may specify phasing of the development, or may require a
development or annexation agreement to insure future provision of required public
facilities and services.
Land Divisions - No person, firm or corporation shall divide any land located within the
corporate limits of the City or within its extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction which shall
result in a land division as defined herein without filing for approval by the City Clerk and
recording a certified survey map meeting all of the applicable requirements of the Hartford
Municipal Code, Wisconsin Statutes, and Wisconsin Administrative Code.
Land Divisions or Subdivisions in Extraterritorial Plat Approval Jurisdiction - The Plan
Commission may recommend, and the Common Council may approve, the subdividing of lands
in the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction into parcels less than 35 acres in size when the
City has a Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance with the Town in which the proposed subdivision
or land division resides, based on the requirements of the applicable Comprehensive Zoning
Ordinance and the applicable Intermunicipal Agreement. The City shall not consider any
subdivision or land division which did not have prior approval by the approving authorities for
the Town(s). The City may require any conditions in the approval of a subdivision or land
division, including the use of restrictive covenants and the creation of homeowner’s associations.
(SECTION 12.0202 REPEALED AND RECREATED 11/11/03—ORDINANCE E-535;
AMENDED 4/10/12—ORDINANCE NO. 1286)
12.0203....DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF LANDS
a) Streets, Highways and Drainageways. Whenever a tract of land to be divided within either
the City or its plat approval jurisdiction encompasses all or any part of an arterial or collector
street, drainageway which has been designated on a City, County, or regional comprehensive
plan or comprehensive plan component adopted by the City, said public way shall be made a
part of the plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions
indicated on said plan or map and as set forth in Section 12.0700 of this Chapter.
b) Parks and Playgrounds. Whenever a tract of land to be divided within the City or within its
plat approval jurisdiction encompasses all or any part of a park, parkway, or playground
which has been designated on a City, County, or regional comprehensive plan or
comprehensive plan component adopted by the City, said park, parkway, or playground shall
be made a part of the plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the locations and
dimensions indicated on said plan and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
subsection 12.0709 of this Chapter. Where the subdivider proposes a park, playground or
open court, the City may require that any such park, playground or open court be privately
owned and held in joint ownership by and maintained for the benefit of the owners of lots
within the subdivision.
12-6 
12.0204....IMPROVEMENTS
Before approval of any Final Plat or Replatting of all or any phase of a subdivision or Final
Certified Survey Map of lands which are or proposed to be located within the City, the
subdivider shall install and/or relocate all street and utility improvements for the lands within
such Final Plat or Certified Survey Map as hereinafter required. Such improvements shall be
made on at least a phase of the subdivision to the satisfaction of the City Engineer within 24
months from the date of Preliminary Plat or CSM approval or such approval will be considered
null and void. If for some physical reason the required improvements cannot be made on at least
a phase of the subdivision within the prescribed 24 month period, the City Common Council may
extend the period and may require a letter of credit or cash bond in an amount equal to 120
percent of the cost of completing such improvements as estimated by the City Engineer, as a
guarantee that the required improvements will be made for the Final Plat or Certified Survey
Map within a reasonable period prescribed by and to the satisfaction of the City Common
Council. Any such letter of credit or cash bond shall remain in the custody of the City. In no
event shall the provision of a letter of credit or cash bond for completion of required
improvements remove the burden of such completion from the subdivider. (AMENDED
10/6/92--ORDINANCE NO. E-219)
In addition:
a) Contractors and Subcontractors retained by the subdivider to construct street and utility
improvements on street rights-of-way proposed for public ownership and use, must do so in
accordance with City specifications.
b) Survey Monuments. Before approval of any Final Plat or Final Certified Survey Map, the
subdivider shall install or reinstall survey monuments and pipes placed in accordance with
the requirements of Chapter 236 of Wisconsin Statutes.
c) Governmental Units and other public agencies to which these contract provisions apply may
file, in lieu of said contract, a letter from officers authorized to act on their behalf agreeing to
comply with the provisions of this section.
12.0205....VARIANCES
Where, in the judgment of the City Common Council it would be inappropriate to apply literally
the provisions of Sections 12.0700 and 12.0800 of this Chapter because exceptional or undue
hardship would result, the Common Council, upon recommendation of the City Plan
Commission, may waive or modify any requirement to the extent deemed just and proper. No
variance to the provisions of this Chapter shall be granted, however, unless the Common Council
makes a specific finding based on documented evidence that all of the following facts and
conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings:
a) Exceptional Circumstances. There may be exceptional, extraordinary, or unusual
circumstances or conditions where a literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter
would result in severe hardship. Such hardships should not apply generally to other
properties or be of such a recurrent nature as to suggest that this Chapter should be changed.
b) Preservation of Property Rights. Such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same vicinity.
c) Absence of Detriment. The variance will not create substantial detriment to adjacent
property and will not materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this
Chapter or the public interest.
12-7 
12.0206....LAND SUITABILITY
No land shall be divided or subdivided for residential use which is determined to be unsuitable
for such use by the City for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil conditions, rock
formation, unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety,
or welfare of the future residents of the proposed land division or of the City. Determination of
suitability shall be based upon the following:
a) Floodlands. No lot of 5,000 square feet or less in area shall include floodlands. All lots
more than 5,000 square feet in area shall contain not less than 5,000 square feet of land
which is at an elevation at least two (2) feet above the elevation of the 100-year recurrence
interval flood, or where such data is not available, five (5) feet above the maximum flood of
record.
b) Lands Zoned as Lowland Conservancy. No lot of 5,000 square feet or less in area shall

SECTION 12.0300....LAND DIVISION PROCEDURE
Section 12.0301....PRE-PRELIMINARY PLAT
Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a Preliminary Plat, the subdivider shall
consult with the City Plan Commission and its staff (and, where applicable, the County Land Use
Department Staff) in order to obtain their review, advice and assistance in the preparation of a
Preliminary Plat. Such consultation shall be termed the Pre-Preliminary Plat stage of the land
division procedure and include the following steps:
a) The subdivider shall prepare a conceptual development scheme or sketch plan at a scale of
1"=100' for all the contiguous lands in which he has legal or equitable interest;
b) Such sketch plan shall include enough information to set forth the proposed development
potential of the parcel to the satisfaction of the City Plan Commission, and include at least
the following:
1. Topographic mapping at not less than ten (10) foot contour interval; except that if in
the judgment of the Plan Commission more detail topographic data is required to
make a recommendation to the Common Council, or where more detailed topography
mapping is available, topography at not less than two (2) foot intervals may be
required prior to Plan Commission action;
2. Soil characteristics or interpretations secured from detail soil maps prepared by the
USDA - Soil Conservation Service (SCS);
3. The limits of woodland cover and wetlands on the entire parcel;
4. Location of lakes, ponds, streams, "Kettles", standing water and designated
floodplain(s) on the parcel;
5. Areas of steep or severe slope conditions (over 10%), high water table conditions, and
potential drainage and erosion problems;
6. Existing and proposed access from parcel to adjacent streets, roads, or properties;
7. Proposed street location and width;
8. Proposed lots including size to the nearest 100 square feet; and
9. Any other pertinent information useful to the subdivider and Plan Commission in
their determination of developability of the parcel;
10. Location of existing utility system and easements. (CREATED 10/6/92--
ORDINANCE NO. E-219)
c) Following review of the sketch plan, the Plan Commission shall either reject the sketch plan
giving reasons for such rejection or approve the sketch plan and make necessary and
appropriate recommendations to the subdivider regarding Preliminary Platting. Such review
and approval of the sketch plan shall constitute conceptual approval of the sketch plan only
and shall not be deemed an approval of the layout and design of the proposed subdivision
plat. If, however, the Preliminary Plat is submitted within 12 months of Pre-Preliminary Plat
approval and the design conforms substantially to such Pre-Preliminary Plat, the Preliminary
Plat shall be entitled to design approval unless new or contradictory data is made available
during the preliminary platting process.
d) Through the Pre-Preliminary Plat Procedure it is expected that the subdivider and Plan
Commission (and County Land Use Department) staff will reach mutual conclusions
regarding the general design and objectives of the proposed development and its possible
effects on the neighborhood, City (and County) at minimum cost. The subdivider will also
gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures and the entire process may
be expedited.
12-10 
12.0302....PRELIMINARY PLAT REVIEW AND APPROVAL
Before submitting a Final Plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare and submit a
Preliminary Plat along with a letter of application in accordance with Section 12.0400 of this
Chapter and the following procedure:
a) The Subdivider shall file one original vellum or mylar and 25 copies of the Proposed
Preliminary Plat and the application with the City Clerk at least 25 days and not more than 60
days prior to the Plan Commission meeting at which action is desired. (AMENDED 5/28/96-
- ORDINANCE NO. E-333)
b) The Preliminary Plat shall cover the entire area owned or controlled by the subdivider even
through only a small portion thereof is proposed for development at the time. The Plan
Commission may waive this requirement where it is unnecessary to fulfill the purpose of the
ordinance and undue hardship would result from strict application thereof.
c) At the time of application for Preliminary Plat approval the subdivider shall pay applicable
fees as set forth in Section 12.1000 of this Chapter and petition for any necessary rezoning of
the lands in question.
d) The City Clerk shall, within two (2) normal work days after filing, transmit the following:
1) Four (4) copies of the proposed Preliminary Plat to the County Land Use Department.
2) Two (2) copies to the Director of the Planning Function in the State Department of
Administration,
a) Two (2) copies to the Director of the State Planning Function for transmission to the
State Department of Transportation if the subdivision abuts or adjoins a state trunk
highway or a connecting street,
b) Two (2) copies to the State Department of Natural Resources if public sewers and/or
floodlands are contained within the proposed subdivision,
3) One (1) copy to each utility,
4) One (1) copy to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission,
5) One (1) copy each to the school district board and to the City Recreation Commission,
6) Seven (7) copies for the City Plan Commission and Common Council,
7) Two (2) copies to the City Engineer, and
8) One (1) copy to be retained by the City Clerk.
e) The State Department of Development, the State Department of Transportation, and the State
Department of Natural Resources shall hereafter be referred to as "objecting" agencies. The
Common Council shall be referred to as an "approving" agency and within the City's plat
approval jurisdiction the Town of Hartford and the Washington County Board are also
referred to as "approving" agencies.
f) The Objecting Agencies shall, within 22 days of date of receiving their copies of the
proposed Preliminary Plat from the City Clerk, notify the subdivider and all other approving
and objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no objections, they shall so certify on
the face of the copy of the proposed Preliminary Plat and shall return that copy to the City
Clerk. If an objecting agency fails to act within 22 days, it shall be deemed to have no
objection to the Plat.
g) The Preliminary Plat shall then be reviewed by the City Plan Commission for conformance
with this Chapter and all codes, chapters, ordinances, rules, regulations, comprehensive plans
and comprehensive plan components of the City relating to the Plat, a public hearing held for
any necessary rezoning, and its recommendations in regard to the Preliminary Plat and
rezoning transmitted to the Common Council.
h) The Common Council, with or without the recommendations of the Plan Commission and the
objecting or approving agencies shall, within 90 days of the date of filing of a Preliminary
12-11 
Plat with the City Clerk, approve, approve conditionally, or reject such Plat unless the time is
extended by mutual written agreement with the subdivider. One (1) copy of the Preliminary
Plat shall thereupon be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon;
and if approved conditionally or rejected, a letter setting forth the conditions of approval or
the reasons for rejection shall accompany the Plat. At least one copy each of the Preliminary
Plat and letter shall also be placed in the City's permanent file.
i) Failure of the Common Council to act on the proposed Preliminary Plat within 90 days from
the date of filing of the Plat with the City Clerk, the time having not been extended as set
forth herein and no unsatisfied objections having been filed, shall constitute approval of the
Preliminary Plat.
j) Approval or Conditional Approval of a proposed Preliminary Plat shall not constitute
approval of the Final Plat or approval of any necessary rezoning, but rather shall be deemed
an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the
preparation of improvement plans and the Final Plat which will be subject to further
consideration by the Plan Commission and Common Council at the time of their submission.
If, however, the Final Plat is submitted within 24 months of Preliminary Plat approval and
conforms substantially to the approved Preliminary Plat layout, the Final Plat shall be entitled
to approval with respect to such layout. In any event, approval or conditional approval of a
Preliminary Plat expires 24 months after the last required Preliminary Plat approval is
granted, unless as permitted by Section 12.0303 e), a Final Plat of at least one phase of the
approved Preliminary Plat is submitted within such 24 month period. In addition, with
respect to a phased Final Plat, said 24 month period shall be renewed and measured from the
last preceding Final Plat phase approval. After expiration of said 24 month period the
subdivider has the option of resubmitting the original Preliminary Plat for approval or
submitting a newly designed Preliminary Plat in accordance with subsection 12.0302 of this
Chapter. Only that area to be platted will be subject to rezoning and only at the time of
submission of such Final Plat.
(SECTION 12.0302 REPEALED AND RECREATED 11/11/03—ORDINANCE NO. E-535)
12.0303....FINAL PLAT REVIEW AND APPROVAL

ORDINANCE NO. E-333)
c) At the time of application for the Final Plat approval, the subdivider shall pay all applicable
fees as set forth in Section 12.1000 of this Chapter. If the subdivider elects to Final Plat in
phases, the Plan Commission shall require a timetable of completion of development of the
entire property included in the Preliminary Plat at/or prior to the time of submittal of the first
phase of the Final Plat. (See Subsection 12.0303 e)
12-12 
d) The City Clerk shall, within two (2) normal work days after filing, transmit four (4) copies to
the County Land Use Department; two (2) copies to the Director of the Planning Function in
the State Department of Development; sufficient additional copies to the Director of the
Planning Function for retransmission of two (2) copies each to the State Department of

In addition:
a) Maximum Error of Closure before adjustment of the survey of the exterior boundaries of the
subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance or position, the ratio of one part in ten
thousand (1:10,000), nor in azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field
measurements exceed this maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a
satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained. The survey of the exterior
boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure.
b) All Street, Block and Lot Dimensions shall be computed as closed geometric figures based
upon the control provided by the closed exterior boundary survey. If field checks disclose an
error for any interior line of the Plat greater than the ratio of one part in three thousand
(1:3,000), or an error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle where
the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer, necessary corrections shall be made.
Where the shorter side of a measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not

12-22 
SECTION 12.0700....DESIGN STANDARDS
12.0701...STREET ARRANGEMENT
In any new Land Division the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location
indicated on the official map, County jurisdictional highway system plan, comprehensive plan or
plan component, or precise neighborhood unit development plan of the City of Hartford,
Washington County, Wisconsin. In addition, streets shall be constructed in conformance with
the adopted construction standards of the City. In areas for which such plans have not been
completed, the street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of
streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to
the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and
safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, to existing or planned
utilities, and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The Land Division shall
be designed so as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street without thereby
causing undue conflict with existing or anticipated traffic flow on such streets. In addition:
a) Arterial Streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to
centers of employment, centers of governmental activities, community shopping areas,
community recreation, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also
be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of major streets
and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing
or planned streets with which they are to connect.
b) Collector Streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of
traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway
system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic
generators such as schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of
population and to the major streets to which they connect.
c) Minor Streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to
discourage use by through traffic, where applicable to permit the design of efficient storm
drainage, utility systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe
and convenient access to abutting property.
d) Proposed Streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless
prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Plan
Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout
of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. Where an
existing dedicated or platted half-street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other
half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider.
e) Arterial Street and Highway Protection. Whenever the proposed Land Division contains or is
adjacent to an arterial street or highway, adequate protection of residential properties,
limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed
frontage, with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property
line, and/or by the use of frontage streets.
f) Streams or Lake Shores shall have a minimum of 60 feet of public access platted to the low
water mark at intervals of not more than one-half mile as required by Section 236.16 (3) of
the Wisconsin Statutes.
g) Reserve Strips shall not be provided on any plat to control access to streets or alleys, except
where control of such strips is placed with the City under conditions approved by the Plan
Commission and Common Council.
12-23 
h) Alleys may be provided in commercial and industrial areas for off-street loading and service
access unless otherwise required by the Plan Commission, but shall not be approved in
residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall not be approved, and alleys shall not connect
directly to an arterial street or highway.
i) Street Names: The Director of Planning and Community Development shall be responsible
for assigning street names. Existing street names shall be projected wherever possible. New
street names will largely reflect the community's wish to honor important aspects of local,
state and national history. Other bases for street names may include: topographical,
geographical and geologic features unique to the street or development area; other prominent
Hartford citizens' last names, whose prominence shall date from 75 or more years ago; other
names which fall into one of the categories suggested by Mr. Palmer; other events or last
names of persons of state or national importance from 50 or more years ago; more recent last
names or events provided it can be unequivocally demonstrated that their prominence is
unlikely to be transitory.
The Director of Planning and Community Development shall establish and maintain a map
grouping names suggested by Herman D. Palmer into geographic areas, in order that street
names shall often provide information as to their general location in the community. Street
names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names elsewhere in the City or in areas
adjacent to the City.
The Director of Planning and Community Development shall confer with appropriate emergency
service and other personnel to assure that new street names are unlikely to cause emergency
response problems, and that input shall take precedence over the process which follows.
The process of street naming shall be initiated by the developer prior to submittal of a
preliminary plat:
a) No later than 21 days prior to submittal of the preliminary plat, or certified survey map,the
developer shall review the Palmer list and the Director of Planning and Community
Development's name grouping map. The developer shall select street names for each
proposed street in accordance with this list, and subsequent plats and documents shall reflect
same.
b) If the developer fails to meet the above timetable, the Director of Planning and Community
Development shall, no later than 14 days prior to the indicated date of preliminary plat or
CSM submittal, provide the developer with a list containing three name alternatives for each
street. From the list provided by the Director of Planning and Community Development, the
developer shall select the street names, and provide this information to the Director of
Planning and Community Development no less than 7 days prior to preliminary
plat/document submittal, and subsequent plats and documents shall reflect same.
c) If the developer fails to meet the timetable following receipt of the Director of Planning and
Community Development's list, the Director of Planning and Community Development shall
select from the list of three alternatives the name or names which in his opinion best reflects
the intent of this policy.
In the event that a proposed street name is not, in the Director of Planning and Community
Development's opinion, in conformance with this policy, the Director of Planning and
Community Development shall assign an appropriate name. (SECTION 12.0701(i) REPEALED
AND RECREATED 6/28/94--ORDINANCE NO. E-264; AMENDED 11/28/95--ORDINANCE
NO. E-311)
12-24 
12.0702...LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY AND RAILROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY TREATMENT
Whenever the proposed Land Division contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway or
railroad right-of-way, the land division design shall provide for the following:
a) When Lots Within the Proposed Land Division back upon or side upon the right-of-way of
an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet
in depth shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot
depth or width. This strip shall be a part of the platted lots but shall have the following
restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees and
shrubs, vehicular public access across and the building of structures hereon prohibited."
b) Commercial and Industrial Properties shall have provided, on each side of the limited access
highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such
highway or railroad for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or
railroad, but not less than 150 feet.
c) Streets Parallel to a Limited Access Highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting an
arterial street or highway or a collector street which crosses said railroad or highway, shall be
located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such
distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the
minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
d) Minor Streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided,
and location of minor streets immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways and to
railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas.
12.0703...STREETS AND OTHER PUBLIC WAY DESIGN STANDARDS
The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all proposed streets and alleys shall be as
specified by the comprehensive plan, comprehensive plan component, official map,
neighborhood development plan, or county jurisdictional highway system plan; or, as set forth in
Table 2 whichever is larger. Arterial street sections are for standard arterial streets only. Crosssections
for freeways, expressways and parkways should be based upon detailed engineering
studies. In addition:
a) Cul-de-sac Streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall not, as a general rule
exceed 600 feet in length as measured from the point of radius of the turnaround to the
nearest intersecting street and in no case shall more than 40 dwelling units abut and have
direct access to a cul-de-sac street. All cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end
permanently closed shall terminate in a circular turnaround as set forth in Table 2 unless
topography or other features of the landscape make such a design impossible, in which case
the Plan Commission shall specifically require the type of turnaround practical. All standard
cul-de-sacs shall include an "island court" in the center which shall be landscaped and
maintained by the abutting homeowners or an established homeowners association and set
forth on the individual property deeds.
b) Temporary Termination of streets at the boundary of a land division or phase of land division
intended to be extended at a later date and where three (3) or more dwelling units have
driveway access to such streets shall, at the discretion of the Plan Commission, be
accomplished with a widened boulevard turnaround designed in accordance with City
standards, or by construction of a temporary "T" turnaround within the street right-of-way
12-25 
having a "cross-bar" length of 64 feet and width of 24 feet. Temporary or semi-permanent
turnarounds must be connected and extended when the adjoining property is developed.
c) Street Grades. Unless necessitated by exceptional topography as determined by the Plan
Commission, the maximum centerline grade of any street or public way shall preferably not
exceed the following:
1) Arterial streets and alleys: six (6) percent.
2) Collector streets: eight (8) percent.
3) Minor streets, cul-de-sacs, and frontage streets: ten (10) percent.
4) Pedestrian ways: twelve (12) percent unless steps of acceptable design are provided.
In addition, the grade of any street shall not exceed twelve (12) percent or in no case shall be
less than five tenths (0.5) of one percent. Street grades shall be established wherever practicable
so as to minimize grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth, and
general leveling of the topography. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical
curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 15 times the algebraic difference in the rates of
grade for arterial and collector streets, and one-half (1/2) this minimum for all other streets.
d) Radii of Curvature. When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one point by more
than 18 degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on said
centerline of not less than the following:
1) Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet.
2) Collector streets: 300 feet.
3) Minor streets: 100 feet.
A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial
and collector streets.
12.0704...STREET INTERSECTION DESIGN
Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors
of good design permit. In addition:
a) The Number of Streets Converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum,
preferably not more than two.
b) The Number of Intersections along arterial streets and highways shall be held to a minimum.
Wherever practicable the distance between such intersections shall not be less than 1,200
feet.
c) Minor and Collector Street shall not necessarily continue across arterial streets. If the
distance between the centerline intersections of any street with any other intersecting street is
less than 250 feet measured along the centerline of the intersecting street, then the location
shall be so adjusted that the distance is increased or the adjoinment across the intersecting
street is continuous and a jog is avoided.
d) On All Streets Where sidewalks are required, ramps or openings to accommodate
handicapped individuals or vehicles shall be provided in accordance with Section 66.616 of
Wisconsin Statutes.
e) The Platting of Half-Streets shall not be permitted except where it is necessary to complete a
half-street existing on the effective date of this Chapter.
12-26 
12.0705...BLOCK DESIGN
The widths, lengths, and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land, zoning
requirements, need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic; and the limitations
and opportunities of topography. In addition:
a) The Length of Blocks in residential areas shall not as a general rule be less than 600 feet nor
more than 1,600 feet in length unless otherwise dictated by exceptional topography or other
limiting factors of good design.
b) Pedestrian Ways of not less than 20 feet in width may be required near the center and entirely
across any block over 1,000 feet in length where deemed essential by the Plan Commission
to provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers,
churches or transportation facilities.
c) The width of Blocks shall be enough to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth
except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic.
Width of lots or parcels reserved or designated for commercial, industrial, or institutional use
shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use
contemplated and the area zoning restrictions for such use.
d) All Electric Power and Communication lines shall, where practical, be placed on mid-block
easements of not less than ten (10) feet in width on the property line, and as required by the
respective utility company, and where possible along rear lot lines.
12.0706...LOT DESIGN
The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the land division
and for the type of development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide
an aesthetically pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting for the building
contemplated. In addition:
a) Side Lot Lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines on
which the lots face unless impractical to do so. Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary
lines rather than cross them.
b) Double Frontage or "Through" Lots shall be prohibited except where necessary to provide
separation of residential development from arterial traffic or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation.
c) Access. Every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at least 40 feet on a public street.
d) Area and Dimension of all lots created in the City of Hartford shall conform to the
requirements of the Zoning Code. All lots created in the City's extraterritorial plat review
jurisdiction shall be at least 35 acres in size unless the City has a Comprehensive Zoning
Ordinance with the Town in which the proposed subdivision or land division resides. Those
building sites not served by a public sanitary sewage system or other approved system shall
be sufficient to permit the use of an "on-site" soil absorption sewage disposal system
designed in accordance with the Wisconsin Administrative Code. (AMENDED 4/9/02--
ORDINANCE NO. E-481; 5/13/03--ORDINANCE NO. E-526; 11/11/03--ORDINANCE E-
535; 6/10/12—ORDINANCE NO. 1286)
e) Excessive Depth of Lots in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of two to one
(2:1) shall be considered a maximum depth to width ratio under normal conditions. Lots
shall normally be rectangular in shape and lots having more than five (5) sides shall be
avoided. Depth of lots or parcels designated for commercial or industrial use shall be
adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated.
12-27 
f) The Width of Lots within the interior of a block shall conform to the requirements of the
City, or applicable Town or County ordinance, and in no case shall a lot have a minimum
width at the building setback line of less than that which is required by the applicable zoning
ordinance.
g) In any Plat Abutting a Lake or Stream; lands lying between the meander line and the water's
edge and any otherwise unplattable lands which lie between a proposed land division and the
water's edge shall be dedicated to the public or made a part of the adjacent lot or parcel.
12.0707...BUILDING SETBACK LINES
Building setback lines appropriate to the location and type of development contemplated, which
are more restrictive than the regulation of the zoning district in which the plat is locate due to
topographic conditions, traffic visibility, Flora, or natural features may be required by the Plan
Commission.
12.0708...EASEMENTS
a) The Plan Commission may require utility easements of widths deemed adequate for the
intended purpose on rear lot lines and on side lot lines or across lots where necessary or
advisable for electric power and communication wires and conduits; storm and sanitary
sewers; and water and other utility lines.
b) Where a land division is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, an
adequate drainageway easement shall be provided as may be required by the Plan
Commission. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway
easement shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and parallel streets or
parkways may be required in connection therewith. Where necessary, storm water drainage
shall be maintained by landscaped open channels of adequate size and grade to hydraulically
accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow. These design details are subject to
review and approval by the City Engineer.
c) Where natural drainage channels, water impoundment areas, and wetlands are encompassed
in whole or in part within the proposed land division the Plan Commission may require
easements to be placed on the plat which will protect and ensure the viability of such natural
resources and/or their aesthetic value.
12.0709...PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES
In the design of the plat, due consideration shall be given to the reservation of suitable sites of
adequate area for future schools, parks, playgrounds, drainageways and other public purposes. If
designated on the City comprehensive plan, comprehensive plan component, official map, or
component neighborhood development plan, such areas shall be made a part of the plat as
stipulated in Section 12.0203 of this Chapter. If not so designated, consideration shall be given
in the location of such sites to the preservation of scenic, cultural, scientific, and historic sites;
wooded areas; wetlands, floodlands, marshes, streams, lakes, and ponds; and steep topography,
ground depression and ravines.
Accordingly, each subdivider of land within he City's jurisdiction shall, at the discretion and
direction of the Plan Commission, either reserve public sites and open-space lands designated on
the City's comprehensive plan or plan component and pay a public site fee; or, where no public
sites or open-space lands are directly involved, pay a public site fee; or, dedicate public sites and
open-space lands designated on the City's Comprehensive plan or plan component. The Plan
12-28 
Commission shall, at the time of reviewing he Preliminary Plat or Preliminary Certified Survey
Map, select one of the following options and record such selection in the minutes of the meeting
at which the Preliminary Plat or Preliminary Certified Survey Map is presented to the Plan
Commission for approval:
a) Reservation of Site Option. Whenever a proposed school site, playground, park, or other
public open-space land designated on the City's comprehensive plan, land use plan,
neighborhood unit development plan, or other comprehensive plan component is
encompassed, all or in part, within a tract of land to be subdivided, the proposed public lands
shall be made a part of the plat and reserved at the time of final plat approval for a period not
to exceed one (1) year, unless extended by mutual agreement, for acquisition at undeveloped
land prices based on a land appraisal by the public agency having jurisdiction and the
subdivider shall pay a public site fee at the time of application for final plat approval at the

12.1102...SPECIFIC WORDS AND PHRASES
ADT (Average Daily Traffic) - The average number of cars per day that pass over a given point.
Methods for calculating ADT for each land use category are found in the Standardized
Development Specifications Manual, second edition. (CREATED 2/11/97--ORDINANCE NO.
E-354)
Alley - A special public way affording only secondary access to abutting properties.

Building Setback Line - A line generally parallel to the street lot line and at a specified minimum
distance from said lot line as set forth in the City (or County) Zoning Ordinance and which
delineates the street side of the buildable area of the lot or parcel.
Cartway - The actual road surface area from curbface to curbface, which may include travel
lanes, parking lanes, and deceleration and acceleration lanes. Where there are no curbs, the
cartway is that portion between the edges of the paved, or hard surfaced, width. (CREATED
2/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-354)
Collector Street - (REPEALED 2/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-354)
Community - A City, incorporated municipality, or a group of adjacent cities and/or incorporated
municipalities having common social, economic or physical interests or characteristics.
Comprehensive Plan - An extensively developed plan, also called a "master plan", adopted by
the Plan Commission and certified to the Common Council pursuant to Section 62.23 of the
Wisconsin Statutes, including proposals for future land use, transportation, redevelopment,
utilities and public facilities. In Hartford, neighborhood plans together comprise the
comprehensive plan for the City and environs. Devices for the implementation of such plans,
such as zoning, official map, land division, and building codes or ordinances and capital
improvement programs may also be considered a part of the comprehensive plan.
County Land Use Department - The agency of County government in Washington County
having land division plat review and approval authority.
Cul-de-Sac - A local street with only one outlet and having the other end closed for the reversal
of traffic movement. (CREATED 2/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-354)
12-39 
Cul-de-sac Street - (REPEALED 2/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-354)
Curb - A vertical or sloping edge of a roadway. (CREATED 2/11/97-- ORDINANCE NO. E-

Development (Urban) - Residential, commercial, industrial, governmental and institutional
development in sufficient concentrations or densities to require a variety and high level of
traditional urban services and facilities including, but not limited to: full or part-time municipal
police and fire protection, and community administration; additional public streets and highways;
neighborhood parks and playgrounds; neighborhood schools; local libraries; public sanitary
sewer facilities, public water supply facilities, and public solid waste removal; storm sewers;
mass transit facilities; continual street maintenance; curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; street lighting;
and neighborhood convenience shopping. Such development may be expected to alter or require
the altering of land and land cover and have detrimental impact on the ground and surface
waters. Historically, in Southeastern Wisconsin, urban development occurs when residential
development is concentrated in large areas at densities in excess of 0.2 dwelling units per gross
acre (or one dwelling unit per five acres).
Development (Rural) - Agricultural, residential, recreational and other open space development
at such concentrations and densities not requiring transitional urban services and facilities.
Historically, in Southeastern Wisconsin, when residential development densities are less than 0.2
dwelling units per gross acre (or one dwelling unit per five acres), such traditional urban services
are not required. Such rural development may be expected to result in minimum disturbance of
the land and land cover, and therefore, less impact on the natural environment.

mark by erosion, change in, or destruction of, vegetation or other easily recognized topographic,
geologic, or vegetative characteristic.
High Groundwater Elevation - The highest elevation to which subsurface water rises. This may
be evidenced by the actual presence of water during wet periods of the year, or by soil mottling
during drier periods. ("Mottling" is a variation of soil colors. In soils with restricted internal

general welfare of the residents of the City of Hartford, Wisconsin.
13.0104 INTENT
It is the general intent that this chapter of the Codes and Ordinances of the City of Hartford
(Zoning Ordinance) be used in the regulation and mapping of zoning district classifications as set
forth herein and in such mapping reflect the existing, most restrictive, or imminent use(s) within
the mapped area at the time of initial mapping or amendments thereto. Eminent means the
commencement of physical development or construction on an individual property within a
reasonable construction period--usually 18 months following rezoning of the property for the
proposed new use. It is not the intent that the zoning district maps, which are an integral part of
this chapter, substitute in whole or in part for the long-range plans for the City. Such long-range
plans are encompassed within the other adopted components of the City's comprehensive plan
which include: neighborhood plans; general city land use plans; general and specific utility and
transportation plans; city park plans; and, floodplain, conservancy, and drainage plans. Further,
this chapter and its application should not be a substitute for other city plan implementation and
regulatory devices such as the Land Division Ordinance, Building Code, Housing Code, and
other specific regulatory devices.
More specifically, it is the intent of this Ordinance and both its text and map components to
regulate and restrict the use of all structures, lands, and waters; and to:
a) Regulate Lot Coverage and the size and location of all structures so as to prevent
overcrowding and to provide adequate sunlight, air, sanitation, and drainage;
b) Regulate Population Density and Distribution so as to avoid sprawl or undue concentration
and to facilitate the provision of adequate public service and utilities;
c) Regulate Parking, Loading, and Access so as to lessen congestion in and promote the safety
and efficiency of streets and highways;
d) Secure Safety from fire, flooding, pollution, contamination, and other dangers;
13-2
e) Stabilize and Protect property values;
f) Preserve and Protect the natural as well as man-made aesthetic characteristics of the City of
Hartford;
g) Prevent and Control Erosion, sedimentation, and other pollution of the surface and
subsurface waters;
h) Further the Maintenance of safe and healthful conditions and prevent and control water
pollution through:
1) Limiting structures to those areas where soil and geological conditions will provide a
safe foundation.
2) Control filling and grading in shoreland areas to prevent serious soil erosion problems.
(AMENDED 6/25/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-331)
i) Prevent both High Water and Overland Flood Damage to persons and property and minimize
expenditures for flood relief and flood control projects;
j) Provide for and Protect a variety of suitable commercial and industrial sites;
k) Protect the traffic-carrying capacity of existing and proposed arterial streets and highways;
l) Implement those municipal, county, watershed, and regional comprehensive plans or
components of such plans adopted by the City of Hartford;
m) Provide for the administration and enforcement of this Ordinance; and to provide penalties
for the violation of this Ordinance.
n) Protect spawning grounds, fish, and aquatic life through:
1) Preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat.
2) Regulating pollution sources.
3) Controlling shoreline alterations, dredging, and lagooning.
o) Control building sites, placement of structures, and land uses in the shoreland area through:
1) Separating conflicting lands uses.
2) Regulating side yards and building setbacks from waterways.
3) Prohibiting certain uses detrimental to the shoreland area.
4) Setting minimum lot sizes and widths.
p) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty through:
1) Restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover.
2) Preventing shoreline encroachment by structures.
3) Controlling shoreland excavating and other earth moving vehicles.
4) Regulating the use and placement of boathouses and other structures.
q) Preserve groundwater resources through the provision of wellhead protection areas.

ORDINANCE NO. E-443)
13.0105 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any
existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, ordinances, rules, regulations, or
permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, wherever this Ordinance
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.
13.0106 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be
minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be
construed to be a limitation or repeal of any other power now possessed by the City of Hartford.
13-3
Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wisconsin Administrative Code
Chapter NR 115, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in
light of Chapter NR 115 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect
on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. (CREATED 6/25/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-
331)
13.0107 SEVERABILITY
If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected
thereby. If any application of this Ordinance to a particular structure, land, or water is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction such judgment shall not be
applicable to any other structure, land, or water not specifically included in said judgment.
13.0108 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection provided by the Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering experience and scientific methods of study. On rare
occasions larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by natural or man-made
causes, such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted by debris. Therefore, this Ordinance does
not imply that areas outside of the delineated floodplain or land uses permitted within the
floodplain will be totally free from flooding and associated flood damages, nor shall this
Ordinance create a liability on the part of or a cause of action against the City of Hartford or any
office or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
Ordinance.
13.0109 REPEAL
All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent or conflicting with this
Ordinance, to the extent of the inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.

(CREATED 7/23/90--ORDINANCE NO. E-158)
13.0205 SITE RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS
No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is suitable for such use or structure by
reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation,
unfavorable topography, or low bearing strength, erosion susceptibility, or any other feature
likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, and general welfare of this community. The
City Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the
particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for certain uses.
The applicant shall have an opportunity to present evidence contesting such unsuitability if he so
desires. Thereafter the City Plan Commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination
of unsuitability. In any event, the following requirements must be met:
a) All lots or ownership parcels shall abut upon a public street, road, or highway and each lot
shall have a minimum frontage of 30 feet or as otherwise required in the City Land Division
Ordinance.
b) Except in an approved Planned Unit Development (PUD) all principal structures in singlefamily
and two-family residential districts shall be located on a lot; and only one (1) principal
structure shall be erected, or moved onto a lot. Construction of accessory uses on a lot under
the same ownership of an abutting lot on which a principal use structure is located will not be
permitted without a conditional use permit. The City Plan Commission may permit more
than one structure per lot in other districts where more than one structure is either needed or
suitable for the orderly development of the parcel. Where additional structures are permitted,
the City Plan Commission may impose additional yard requirements, landscaping
requirements, or parking requirements or require a minimum separation distance between
principal structures.
c) No Zoning Permit shall be issued for a lot or parcel which abuts a public street dedicated to
only a portion of its proposed width and located on that side thereof from which required
dedication has not been secured.
13-6
d) Lots Abutting More Restrictive zoning districts shall provide side and rear yards not less than
those required in the more restrictive abutting district. The street yards on the less restrictive
district shall be modified for a distance of one lot width (or length) from the district boundary
line so as to equal the average of the street yards required in both districts.
e) Structures or plantings proposed to be located within the defined "Horizontal Area of Solar
Detriment" of an existing use having an operational active solar system may not be placed
either initially or at some future date so as to intrude into the defined "Vertical Area of Solar
Detriment" of the existing use.
f) Land Divisions. For all subdivision proposals, certified survey maps, and other
developments exceeding five acres in area, or where the estimated cost of a proposed
development exceeds $125,000, the applicant shall provide all computations which are
required to show the effects of the proposal on flood heights, velocities and floodplain
storage. Further, the applicant shall provide within such proposals regional flood elevation
data, and the means to provide adequate surface drainage and to minimize flood damage.
The limits of the 100-year recurrence interval floodplain shall be shown on the plat or map.
In those instances where the applicant is not required to provide computations and where
inadequate data exists, the available information may be transmitted to the WI Department of
Natural Resources' District Office for a determination of the flood protection elevations and
for an evaluation of the effects of the proposal on flood heights, velocities and floodplain
storage. Additional information, such as valley cross-sections or survey data may be
required by the Department to determine the effects of the proposal. This information shall
be obtained from the applicant or the applicant's agent by the City. The provisions of Section
13.1207 of this Ordinance shall apply hereto. The applicant shall provide all data and
calculations for any development which would require an amendment to the district
boundaries or to the flood profile of the 100-year recurrence flood interval. (REPEALED AND

the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and dated December 4, 1984 and
revised flood profile adopted April 10, 1989. The information contained in the flood
insurance study is further illustrated on the FEMA Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and
Flood Insurance Rate Map, both maps dated December 4, 1984. Where a conflict exits
between the floodland limits as shown on the Supplementary Floodland Zoning Map and
actual field conditions, the elevations from the 100-year recurrence interval flood profile
shall be the governing factor in locating the regulatory floodland limits. (AMENDED 6/25/96--

shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Maps and
actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall
contact the appropriate district office of the DNR to determine if the shoreland-wetland
district boundary as mapped is in error. If DNR staff and the Zoning Administrator concur
that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, following DNR approval, the
13-9
Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit
in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. The Zoning

purpose is the ultimate connection with a navigable body of water.
3) Soil Conservation Practices and Agricultural Drainage Maintenance.
a) Soil conservation practices such as tiled terraces, runoff diversions, and grassed
waterways used for erosion control shall not require a permit under subsection
13.0333 (i)(2) when designed and constructed to Soil Conservation Service technical
standards.
b) The maintenance of existing agricultural drainage systems shall be permitted in
conformity with the following construction standards:
? The maintenance dredging of farm drainage ditches is limited to reestablishing the
original ditch cross section unless a special exception permit under subsection
13.0330 (i)(2)(b) is obtained.
? Ditch banks shall be constructed at a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical
fifty (50) percent grade or flatter.
? Ditch banks shall be maintained in a vegetative cover.
4) Permit Conditions. In granting a conditional use permit under subsection 13.0333 (i)(2),
the Plan Commission shall attach the following conditions, where appropriate, in addition
to those provisions specified in subsection 13.0400:
a) The smallest amount of bare ground shall be exposed for as short a time as feasible.
b) Temporary ground cover (such as mulch or jute netting) shall be used and permanent
vegetative cover shall be established.
c) Diversion berms or bales, silting basins, terraces, filter fabric fencing, and other
methods shall be used to prevent erosion.
d) Lagoons shall be constructed to avoid fish trap conditions.
e) Fill shall be stabilized according to accepted engineering standards.
f) Filling shall not restrict a floodway or destroy the flood storage capacity of a
floodplain.
g) Channels or artificial watercourses shall be constructed with side slopes of two (2)
units horizontal to one (1) unit vertical or flatter which shall be promptly vegetated,
unless bulkheads or riprap are provided.
j) Conditional Uses.
1) Planned Unit Developments. Planned Unit Developments are intended to permit smaller
lots and setbacks where the physical layout of the lots is so arranged (often by setting
13-67
them back farther from navigable water) as to better assure the control of pollution and
preservation of ground cover than would be expected if the lots were developed with the
normal lot sizes and setbacks and without special conditions placed upon the Planned
Unit Development at the time of its approval. A condition of Planned Unit
Developments is the preservation of open space, preferably on the shoreland, in
perpetuity.
2) Requirements for Planned Unit Development. The Plan Commission may approve a
Planned Unit Development in the SHO-1 District either by approving first a Conditional
Use Permit and then a plat or by approving only a plat for the specific planned residential
project upon finding, after a public hearing, that all of the following facts exist:
a) Area. The area proposed for the Plan Unit Development is at least forty (40) acres in
size.
b) Pollution Control. The location and nature of the sanitary systems which will serve
the homesites individually or collectively will assure that effluent from the sanitary
systems will not reach the ground or surface waters in a condition which would
contribute to health hazards, taste, odor, turgidity, fertility or impair the aesthetic
character of navigable waters.
c) Preservation of Ground Cover. The location of homesites and the dedication of part of
the land for use by the public or residents of the Planned Unit Development will
preserve the ground cover of the shoreland and scenic beauty of the navigable water,
prevent erosion and other pertinent factors. Land not used for lots and streets shall be
dedicated in perpetuity to remain in open space. This may be accomplished by
conveyance in common to each of the owners of lots in the development, a
homeowner's association, or similar legally constituted body shall be created to
maintain the open space land. Any restriction placed on platted land by covenant,
grant of easement, or any other manner which was required by a public body or which
names a public body as grantee, promisee or beneficiary, shall vest in the public body
the right to enforce the restriction at law or in equity against anyone who has or
acquires an interest in the land subject to the restriction.
d) Density. The number of platted homesites shall not exceed those which would have
been possible if the same land were platted in accordance with the minimum lot sizes,
setbacks, and widths provided by the applicable provisions of the land division and
zoning ordinances.
e) Lot Sizes, Widths, Setbacks, and Tree-cutting. The lot sizes, widths, and setbacks
shall not be less than those provided for in Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter
H85, and shall not be so small as to cause pollution or erosion along streets or other
public highways and waterways or so small as to substantially depreciates the property
values in the immediate neighborhood. Shore cover provisions in section 13.0333 (h)
shall apply except that maximum width of a lake frontage opening shall be one
hundred (100) feet.
3) Procedure for establishing a Planned Unit Development Conditional Use Permit. The
procedure for obtaining a permit for a Planned Residential Unit Development Conditional
Use shall be as follows:
13-68
a) Petition. An application setting forth all of the facts required in subsection 13.0333
(i)(2) shall be submitted to the administrator with 25 copies to provide for distribution.
b) Review and Hearing. The application shall be submitted to the Plan Commission,
which shall hold a public hearing. Copies of the notice of the hearing shall also be
sent to the appropriate district office of the DNR as described in subsection 13.0403
(b) of this code.
The Plan Commission's deliberation shall include the recommendations of any federal,
state, or local agency with which the Plan Commission consults. If a petition seeks
approval of a Planned Unit Development plat without first seeking the granting of a
Conditional Use Permit, a hearing shall be held on such plat. If, however, a hearing is
first held on the Conditional Use Permit for a Planned Unit Development, a second
public hearing need not be held in connection with the approval of a subsequent plat or
plats which comply with the Conditional Use Permit as approved.
c) Findings and Conditions of Approval. The Plan Commission shall make written
findings as to the compliance or noncompliance of the proposed permit with each of
the applicable requirements set forth in subsection 13.0333 (j)(2). If the petition is
granted in whole or part, the Plan Commission shall attach such written conditions to
the approval as are required by and consistent with subsection 13.0400. The
conditions of approval shall in all cases establish the specific restrictions applicable
with regard to minimum lot sizes, width, setbacks, and the location of septic systems
and the preservation of ground cover and open space.
d) Planning Studies. A landowner or petitioner may at his or her own expense develop
the facts required to establish compliance with the provisions of subsection 13.0333
(j)(2) or may be required to contribute funds to the City of Hartford to defray all or
part of the cost of such studies being undertaken by the City or any agency or person
with whom the City contracts for such work.
e) Sanitary Regulations. All Planned Unit Developments within the SHW-1 Shoreland
Overlay District shall be serviced by municipal sanitary sewer and public water
systems.
k) Dimensions of Building Sites.
1) Lots Not Served by Public Sanitary Sewer.
a) Minimum Area and Width for each Main Building. The minimum lot area shall be
twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. and the minimum average lot width shall be one

served by public sanitary sewer.
2) Lots Served by a Public Sanitary Sewer.
13-69
a) Minimum Area and Width for each Main Building. The minimum lot area shall be ten
thousand (10,000) sq. ft. and the minimum average lot width shall be sixty-five (65)
feet.
3) Substandard Lots.
a) Substandard Lots Served by a Public Sanitary Sewer. A substandard lot served by a
public sanitary sewer which is at least seven thousand five hundred (7,500) sq. ft. in
area and is at least fifty (5) feet in width at the building setback line and at least fifty
(50) in width at the ordinary high water mark may be used as a building site for a
single-family dwelling upon issuance of a zoning permit by the Zoning Administrator
if it meets all of the following requirements.
? Such use is permitted in the zoning district.
? The lot was on record in the County Register of Deeds Office prior to the effective
date of this chapter.
? The lot was in separate ownership from abutting lands prior to the effective date of
this chapter. If abutting lands and the substandard lot were owned by the same
owner as of the effective date of this chapter, the substandard lot shall not be sold
or used without full compliance with the terms of this chapter, including minimum
area and width requirements found in subsections 13.0333 (j)(1) and 13.0333 (j)(2)
of this chapter.
? All other dimensional requirements of this chapter (including side yard and
setback) shall be complied with.
b) Substandard Lots Not Served by Public Sanitary Sewer. A substandard lot not served
by public sanitary sewer which is at least ten thousand (10,000) sq. ft. in area and at
least sixty-five (65) feet in width at the building setback line and at least sixty-five
(65) feet in width at the ordinary high water mark may be used as a building site for a
single-family dwelling upon issuance of a zoning permit by the Zoning Administrator
if it meets all of the requirements of subsection 13.0333 (j)(2)(a).
c) Other Substandard Lots. Except for lots which meet the requirements of subsections
13.0333 (j)(2) or 13.0333 (j)(3), a building permit for the improvement of a lot having
lesser dimensions than those stated shall be issued only after the granting of a variance
by the Board of Appeals.

rebuilt unless a conditional use permit is granted for such expansion, replacement, or
rebuilding. This section does not apply to normal maintenance or minor repairs.
m) Changing Technology
1) The uses prohibited by this district are prohibited based upon the combined pollution
experience of many individual uses, and the technology generally employed by a
particular use considered to be of high risk for pollution to the groundwater resource. If
changes to the technology used in a prohibited use results low or non-risk materials or
methods, the City may, after conferring with expert opinion and the Plan Commission
and after appropriate public notice and hearing, remove from the designated list of
prohibited uses such uses that are demonstrated to no longer pose a hazard to
groundwater quality.
2) It is not the intention of this provision to accept alternative processing, storage and
handling, of prohibited pollutant materials as the basis for making a use permissible. The
intention of this ordinance is to continue a prohibition on such uses until the technology
of the use removes the reliance upon the pollutant material or processes deemed to be a
groundwater hazard.
n) Enforcement and Penalty
1) PENALTY - Any person who violates, neglects, or refuses to comply with any of the
provisions of this ordinance shall be subject to a penalty as provided in Chapter 42 of the

Appendix A
The boundaries for Zone A and Zone B of the Wellhead Protection Overlay District (WP-1) for
each of the City of Hartford's six municipal wells represent the Calculated Fixed Radius (CFR)
for the 30-Day and 5-Year Time of Travel as determined by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources as part of a 1998 wellhead vulnerability assessment. The CFR factors in such
variables as pumpage rates and soil porosity. Where the Calculated Fixed Radius was less than
1200 feet (as was the case in Well #4) the DNR adjusted the radius to 1200 feet as a minimum
distance for protection of the well.

SECTION 13.0800--NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND, NONCONFORMING
STRUCTURES, NONCONFORMING YARDS, AND
CHARACTERISTICS OF USE
13.0801 INTENT
It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination, as expeditiously as is
reasonable, of existing uses and in some cases structures which are not in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the
prevention of the establishment of new uses which would violate the provisions of this
ordinance. It is further the intent of this section that any elimination of nonconforming uses or
nonconforming structures shall be affected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of
established private property rights.
13.0802 EXISTING NONCONFORMING USES
The lawful nonconforming use of a structure, land, or water existing at the time of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance may be continued although the use does not conform with the
provisions of this ordinance however:
a) Only That Portion of the land or water in actual use may be so continued and the structure
may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved, or structurally altered
except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this
ordinance.
b) Total Lifetime Structural Repairs or alterations shall not exceed 50 percent of the City's
equalized value of the structure unless it is permanently changed to conform to the use
provisions of this ordinance.
c) Substitution of New Equipment may be permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals if such
equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use with the neighboring
uses.
13.0803 EXISTING NONCONFORMING LAND AREAS
Lots, parcels or tracts of land which do not conform to the minimum area, size and/or shape
requirements of this ordinance at the time of its passage may be allowed to be built upon so long
as such parcels and the building to be built meet all other requirements of this ordinance and no
such land area is in the same ownership as adjacent lands which if combined would constitute a
conforming lot, parcel or tract.
13.0804 EXISTING NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
The lawful nonconforming structure existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this
ordinance may be continued although its size or location does not conform with the lot width, lot
area, yard, height, parking and loading, and access provisions of this ordinance; however, if
nonconforming prior to adoption of amendment to this ordinance it shall not be extended,
enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or
order, or so as to comply with the provisions of this ordinance.
13-104
13.0805 CHARACTERISTICS OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Structures which encroach upon setback and other yard requirements, but which met setback and
yard requirements at the time of construction, may be structurally altered provided that they do
not create a greater degree of encroachment and meet all other requirements of the district.
13.0806 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any
period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the assessed value of
the building, provided that the interior cubic area of the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this ordinance shall not be increased. Nothing in this ordinance shall
be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by the Building Inspector.
13.0807 ABOLISHMENT OR REPLACEMENT
a) If Such Nonconforming Use is Discontinued or Terminated for a period of 12 months, any
future use of the structure, land, or water shall conform to the provisions of this ordinance.
When a nonconforming use or structure is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, the public
enemy, or other calamity, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current assessed value,
it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use provisions of this ordinance.
b) A File of All Nonconforming Uses shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator listing
the following: owner's name and address; use of this structure, land, or water; type of
nonconformance; and assessed value at the time of it becoming a nonconforming use.
c) The Maintenance and Repair of Nonconforming Boathouses that extend waterward beyond
the ordinance high water mark of any navigable waters shall comply with the requirements of
Wisconsin Statutes Section 30.121. (CREATED 6/25/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-331)
d) If the Nonconforming Use of a temporary structure is discontinued such nonconforming use
may not be recommended. (CREATED 6/25/96-- ORDINANCE NO. E-331)
e) Uses Which are Nuisances shall not be permitted to continue as nonconforming uses.
(CREATED 6/25/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-331)
13.0808 CHANGES AND SUBSTITUTIONS
Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform, it shall not revert back to a
nonconforming use or structure. Once the Zoning Board of Appeals has permitted the
substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use, the
existing nonconforming use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and become subject
to all the conditions required by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
13-105
13.0809 FLOODLAND NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
Floodland nonconforming uses repaired or altered under the nonconforming use provisions of
this code shall provide for floodproofing to those portions of the structures involved in such
repair or alteration. Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the Zoning Administrator
and shall consist of a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths, and other factors
associated with the 100-year recurrence interval flood.
13.0810 WETLAND NONCONFORMING USES
Notwithstanding Section 62.23 (7)(h) of the Wisconsin Statutes, the repair, reconstruction,
renovating, remodeling or expansion of a legal nonconforming structure located in the C-1
Lowland Conservancy District and in existence at the time of adoption or subsequent amendment
of this Ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 62.231 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or of an
environmental control facility in existence on May 7, 1982, related to that structure, is permitted
pursuant to Section 62.231 (5) of the Wisconsin Statutes. Section 62.23 (7)(h), however, applies
to any environmental control facility that was not in existence on May 7, 1982, but was in
existence on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment. (CREATED 4/10/89--ORDINANCE
NO. E-130)
13.0811 CONDITIONAL USES NOT NONCONFORMING USES
Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this ordinance shall not be
deemed a nonconforming use, but shall be deemed a conforming use in such district.
13-106
SECTION 13.0900--MODIFICATIONS

13.0907 REGULATIONS FOR MOVING BUILDINGS
a) General. No person shall move any building or structure upon any of the public ways of the
City without first obtaining a permit therefore from the Building Inspector. Every such
permit issued by the Building Inspector for the moving of a building shall designate the route
to be used, the conditions to be complied with, and shall limit the time during which the
moving operations shall be continued.
b) Continuous Movement. The moving of buildings shall be a continuous operation during all
the hours of the day, night, and day-by-day, until fully completed. All of such operations
shall be performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No building in the
process of being moved shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street crossing or
intersection or so near thereto as to prevent easy access to fire hydrants or any other public
facility. Lights or lighted lanterns shall be kept in conspicuous places at each corner of the
building during the night.
c) Street Repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one (1) day
after the building reaches its destination, report that fact to the Building Inspector who, in the
company of the City Engineer, shall inspect the streets and highways over which the building
was moved and ascertain their condition. If the moving operation has caused any damage to
any street or highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall within five (5)
working days make any repairs ordered by the City Engineer. Upon the failure of the permit
holder to complete the required repairs to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, the City shall
cause the repairs to be made and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on
his bond responsible for the payment for such repairs. (AMENDED 11/28/95--ORDINANCE NO.
E-312)
d) Conformance with Building Code. No permit shall be issued to move a building within or
into the City and to establish it upon a parcel within the City until the Building Inspector has
made an investigation of the building at the location from which it is to be moved, and is
satisfied that the building is in a sound condition and of such construction that it will meet
the requirements of the Building Code in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs,
improvements, and remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the
Building Inspector, and he shall make a finding to the effect that all such repairs,
improvements, and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of the Building
Code, and that when completed, the building will comply with the Building Code. In the
event a building is to be moved from the City to some point outside the jurisdiction of the
City, the provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed
alterations to such building may be disregarded.
e) Bond Requirement. 1) Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way
in the City, the party applying therefore shall provide a cash bond or letter of credit to the
City in a sum to be fixed by the Building Inspector and which shall not be less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) and to be executed by all parties concerned, with the written
stipulation that the City is not liable for any costs or expenses incurred by it in connection
with any claims for damages to any persons or property, and the payment of any judgment
together with the costs and expenses incurred by the City in connection therewith, arising out
of the removal of the building for which the permit is issued.
13-110
2) Unless the Building Inspector; upon investigation, shall find that the excavation exposed
by the removal of the building from its original foundation is so close to a public
thoroughfare as to cause possible hazard and damage to pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
the cash bond or letter of credit required shall be conditioned to require the person
holding the permit to construct adequate barriers around the excavation and within 48
hours, filling such excavation or adopting and employing such other means, devices or
methods approved by the Building Inspector calculated to prevent harm to persons or
property.
f) Insurance. The Building Inspector shall require, in addition to a cash bond or letter of credit,
public liability insurance covering injury to one person in the sum of not less than one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and for one accident in a sum not less than two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000), together with property damage insurance in a sum not less than
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or such other coverage as deemed necessary.
g) Plan Commission Review. 1) Upon receipt of an application for a moving permit the
Building Inspector shall request review of the application by the Plan Commission after he
has found that the proposed moving complies in all respects with all other ordinances of the
City. The Plan Commission may, if it desires, hear the applicant for the moving permit in
question and/or the owner of the lot on which it is proposed to locate the building in question,
together with any other persons, either residents or property owners, desiring to be heard,
giving such notice of hearing as they may deem sufficient. Such hearing may be adjourned
for a reasonable length of time, and within 48 hours after the close of the hearing, the Plan
Commission shall, in writing, make a negative or positive finding as required by this section,
and file such finding in the office of the City Clerk, who shall transmit a copy of the finding
to the Building Inspector.
2) No moving permit shall be issued unless it has been found by the Plan Commission, after
an examination of the application for the permit, that the exterior architectural appeal and
functional plan of the building to be moved or moved and altered, will not be at variance
with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the buildings already
constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood, or the
character of the applicable district established by this ordinance or any ordinance
amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, as to cause a substantial depreciation in the
property values of said neighborhood within said applicable district. The application for a
moving permit shall include exterior elevations of the building and accurate photographs
of all sides and views of the same, and in case it is proposed to alter the exterior of said
building, plans and specifications of such proposed alterations and after a view of the
building proposed to be moved and of the site at which it is to be located. In case the
applicant proposes to alter the exterior of the building after it has been moved, he shall
submit with his application papers, complete plans and specifications for the proposed
alterations. Before a permit shall be issued for a building to be moved and altered, the
applicant shall provide a cash bond or letter of credit to the Plan Commission, which shall
not be less than $1,000 to be executed in the manner provided in this section to the effect
that he will, within a time period to be set by the Plan Commission, complete the
proposed exterior alterations to said building in the manner set forth in his plans and
specifications. This cash bond or letter of credit shall be in addition to any other bond or
surety which may be required by other applicable ordinances of the municipality. No
occupancy permit shall be issued for a moved building until the exterior alterations
proposed to be made have been completed.
13-111
h) Board of Appeals. Any person entitled to appeal of a grant or refusal of a grant for moving
building may appeal to the Board of Appeals in the manner as set forth in Section 13.1300 of
this ordinance.
13-112
SECTION 13.1000--ADMINISTRATION
13.1001 PLAN COMMISSION
a) The City of Hartford Plan Commission shall have the duties of making reports and
recommendations relating to the planning and development of the City to public officials,
agencies, public utility companies, civic, educational, professional, and other organizations,
and citizens. The Commission, its members and employees, in the performance of its
functions, may enter upon any land and make examinations and surveys related to the
planning of the City. In general, the Plan Commission shall have such powers as may be
necessary to enable it to perform its functions and promote planning of the City and environs.
b) Consultation. Anyone seeking approval of an annexation, a conditional use permit, approval
of a preliminary and/or final plat, approval of a Certified Survey Map, approval of a
conceptual plat, site plan review, or a zoning change shall be entitled to one consultation with
the City Planning and Engineering Staffs in exchange for fee requirements listed in Chapter
42. For all subsequent consultations and City Staff professional preparation time, the
petitioner shall pay a fee based upon hourly rates as determined in Chapter 42. Immediately
following the first consultation, City Staff shall prepare an estimate of the projected cost for
additional Staff consultations and preparation of the Staff review of the petitioner’s proposal
for submittal to the Plan Commission, Common Council, or other body determined by the
City. The petitioner shall, prior to the City Staff proceeding with consultation and review
and prior to placement of the matter on an agenda, submit a certified check to the City
Planner, which shall be placed in an escrow account, and drawn upon as appropriate. An
accounting shall be provided to the petitioner when accessing said escrow account. Unless
City Staff provides a certificate to the petitioner at the end of the first consultation attesting
that all aspects of the development have been completely addressed to Staff’s satisfaction and
that Staff time preparing the matter for review shall be minimal, it is a rebuttable
presumption that, without an escrow amount, any application forwarded to the Plan
Commission and/or Common Council shall be subject to rejection as incomplete. If the
petitioner believes that the amount to be escrowed or the amount drawn down by the City is
excessive, he/she may appeal to the Common Council. Upon final approval of the
petitioner’s proposal by the Common Council, the City shall promptly return any unused
escrowed amount without interest. (CREATED 11/26/02—ORDINANCE NO. E-501)

No variance to the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that
all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings:
(AMENDED 3/28/95--ORDINANCE NO. E-289)
a) Preservation of Intent. No variance shall be granted that is not consistent with the purpose
and intent of the regulations for the district in which the development is located. No variance
shall have the effect of permitting a use in any district that is not stated permitted use,
accessory use, or conditional use in that particular district.
b) Exceptional Circumstances. There must be exceptional, extraordinary, or unusual
circumstances of conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use, or intended use that
do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the
variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that the Zoning
Ordinance should be changed.
13-129
c) Economic Hardship and Self-Imposed Hardship Not Grounds for Variance. No variance shall
be granted solely on the basis of economic gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be
considered as grounds for the granting of a variance.
d) Preservation of Property Rights. The variance must be necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district
and same vicinity.
e) Absence of Detriment. No variance shall be granted that will create substantial detriment to
adjacent property and will materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this
ordinance of the public interest.
f) Additional Requirements in Floodland Districts. No variance shall be granted where:
1) Filling and development contrary to the purpose and intent of the F-1 and F-2 Districts
would result.
2) A change in the boundaries and Floodland District would result.
3) A lower degree of flood protection than a point two (2) feet above the 100-year
recurrence interval flood for the particular area would result.
4) Any action contrary to the provisions of Chapter NR 116 of the Wisconsin
Administrative Code would result.
13.1309 WETLAND AND FLOODLAND MAPPING DISPUTES
a) Wetland Disputes. Whenever the Board of Appeals is asked to interpret a shoreland C-1
Lowland Conservancy District boundary where an apparent discrepancy exists between the
City's Final WETLAND Inventory Map and actual field conditions, the City shall contact the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to determine if the wetland inventory
map is in error. If the DNR staff concurs that the particular area was incorrectly mapped as a
wetland, the Board of Appeals shall direct the City Plan Commission to initiate appropriate
action to rezone the property within a reasonable amount of time.
b) Floodland Disputes. Whenever the Board of Appeals is asked to interpret a floodland
boundary where an apparent discrepancy exists between the federal Flood Insurance Study
and actual field conditions, the following procedure shall be used. The floodland boundary
shall be determined by use of the flood profiles contained in an engineering study, or where
such information is not available, by experience flood maps or any other evidence available
to the Board of Appeals. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be
given the opportunity to present his own technical evidence. Where it is determined that the
floodplain is incorrectly mapped, the Board of Appeals shall advise the City Plan
Commission of its findings and the Plan Commission shall proceed to petition the Common
Council for a map amendment. (SECTION 13.1309 CREATED 4/10/89--ORDINANCE NO. E-130)

applicant shall undertake serious and continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a
mutually agreeable method of preserving the subject property. During the suspension
period the owner shall take whatever steps are necessary to prevent further deterioration of
the building. At the end of the six (6) month period the Committee shall act on the
suspended application by either granting or denying, a Certificate for the proposed
demolition or moving. Failure to issue a Certificate within 30 days of the date of
application or to issue a written recommendation to suspend action shall be deemed
approval of a Certificate for the demolition or removal, provided that the determination
period may be extended an additional 30 days by mutual written stipulation of the
applicant and the Committee.
3. In determining whether a Certificate should be issued for any demolition or moving, the
Committee shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the following:
a) Whether the building or structure is of such architectural or historic significance that
its demolition or moving would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to
the general welfare of the people of the City and the State;
b) Whether the building or structure, although not itself a Landmark building,
contributes to the distinctive architectural or historic character of the HAPEO District
as a whole and therefore should be preserved for the benefit of the people of the City
and State;
c) Whether demolition or moving of the subject property would be contrary to the
purposes and intent of this Chapter and to the objectives of the historic preservation
plan(s), design(s), criteria, or guidelines for the applicable HAPEO District as duly
adopted by the Common Council;
d) Whether the building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design,
texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with
great difficulty and/or expense;
e) Whether retention of the building or structure would promote the general welfare of
the people of the City and the State by encouraging study of American history,
architecture and design or by developing an understanding of American culture and
heritage;
f) Whether the building or structure is in such a deteriorated condition that it is not
structurally or economically feasible to preserve or restore, (provided, however, that
any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner which is self-created, or which is the
result of any failure to maintain the property in good repair, cannot qualify as a basis
for the issuance of a Certificate); or,
g) Whether any new structure proposed to be constructed, or change in use proposed to
be made, is compatible with the buildings and environment of the HAPEO District in
which the subject property is located.
14-8
4. An appeal from the decision of the Committee to grant or deny a Certificate whether this
determination is made upon receipt of the application for a demolition or moving permit,
or at the end of the six month period (in a case where action on the application has been
suspended), or to suspend action on a demolition or moving application, may be made to
the Plan Commission. The applicant for the Certificate or any Alderperson of the District
in which the subject building or structure is located may initiate such appeal. Such appeal
shall be initiated within 30 days of the date the application was denied by notifying the
City Clerk in writing. After a hearing, the Commission may by favorable vote of twothirds
(2/3) of its members, reverse or modify the decision of the Committee if, after
weighing the interest of the public in preserving the subject property and the interest of the
owner in using the property for his or her own purposes, the Commission finds that, owing
to special conditions pertaining to the specific property, failure to grant the Certificate for
the proposed demolition will preclude all reasonable use of the property and/or will cause
serious hardship for the owner, (provided that any self-created hardship shall not be a basis
for reversal or modification of the Committee's decision). (AMENDED 5/9/95--
ORDINANCE NO. E-290)
The applicant may also appeal the action of the Commission to the Common Council
which shall hold a public hearing and following such hearing may, by favorable vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of its members, modify the action of the Commission.
14.11 GUIDELINES FOR RESTORATION, REHABILITATION AND NEW
CONSTRUCTION
14.1101 General
In considering proposed changes to Landmarks or structures located within a HAPEO
District, the Committee shall consider the following:
1. Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which
requires minimal alteration of the exterior of a building, structure or site and its
environment.
2. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its
environment should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or
distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.
3. All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own specific
time (era) of construction. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier or later design and construction period appearance shall be discouraged.
4. Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and
development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. Changes which may
have acquired design or construction significance in their own right shall be recognized
and weighed as a factor.
5. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a
building, structure or site must be treated with sensitivity.
14-9
6. Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever
possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, size and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on
accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence
rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different elements from other
buildings or structures.
7. The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that may damage the historic building materials
shall not be undertaken without authorization by the Committee.
8. Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources
affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
9. Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be
discouraged when such alterations and additions to not destroy significant historical,
architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color,
material, and character of the property, district, neighborhood or environment.
10. Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be accomplished in such
a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
11. Contemporary design used in any new construction should correspond in height, width,
proportion, relationship to street, roof forms, composition, rhythm, proportion of openings,
materials and color to the existing buildings in the district.
14.1102 Specific guidelines for restoration, rehabilitation and new construction
Specific guidelines for the restoration and rehabilitation of existing structures and new
construction for specific designated Landmarks or properties within HAPEO District shall be
formulated by the Committee prior to the formal designation or delineation of such Landmark or
HAPEO District by the Committee.
14.12 MAINTENANCE OF LANDMARKS, SITES AND HAPEO DISTRICTS
Every person in charge of an improvement on a Landmark site or in a HAPEO District
shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such improvement and all interior portions
thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause the exterior portions of such
improvement to fall into a state of disrepair. This provision shall be in addition to all other
provisions of the Codes and Ordinances of the City requiring such improvement to be kept in
good repair.

APPENDIX A
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR RESTORATION, REHABILITATION AND NEW
CONSTRUCTION IN THE HARTFORD DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL HISTORIC
ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OVERLAY (HAPEO)
DISTRICT
I. JUSTIFICATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The Historic Preservation and Enhancement Committee finds that the area of the City
described as the Hartford Downtown Commercial HAPEO District and delineated on the map
designated as Exhibit A attached hereto has special historical, architectural, community and
aesthetic value; with distinct visual characteristics representative of the central commercial areas
of smaller Midwestern towns of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, characteristics
as yet largely disturbed by the disruptive effects of mid-twentieth century urban growth, and that
these characteristics and the historical associations they call to mind are worthy of protecting,
enhancing and perpetuating for the people of Hartford, Washington County, Wisconsin and the
Nation. The Plan Commission agrees with this finding. The Common Council also agrees with
this finding and therefore hereby creates the Hartford Downtown HAPEO District encompassing
the area of the City shown on Exhibit A attached hereto.
II. CHARACTER OF DISTRICT
The Hartford Downtown Commercial HAPEO District is composed largely of commercial
buildings, two to three stories in height, constructed of masonry materials and placed
immediately adjacent to the street right-of-way and abutting adjoining buildings at the side
property line (no set-backs).
Facades are generally contiguous and parallel to the street. Buildings front Main Street on
both sides forming a corridor. The similarity of architecture of the facades originally gave the
street a consistent and coordinated appearance contributing to its character. The major period of
initial construction in the Downtown HAPEO District extends from post-Civil war into the
1930's and elements of late 19th-early 20th century historic styles are evident. Although no
building is an outstanding example of a specific style, considered collectively they project a
sense of place and an image of Hartford, Wisconsin.
III. PARTS OF THE TYPICAL HARTFORD DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL
BUILDING
A. The Shopfront - The shopfronts are of late 19th-early 20th century styles consisting of
large expanses of glass contained between piers or columns. Often wooden panels were
placed at the base of the show windows. An entry door was placed centrally or to either
side. In many cases entry to the second floor is directly from the street.
B. Horizontal Division Between 1st and 2nd Story - Usually some form of horizontal
architectural element such as a continuous lintel, string course or contrasting trim separates
the first floor shopfront from upper stories.
14-13
C. Upper Story Windows - Generally, double hung windows appear either singly or in pairs,
and occasionally there are bays on upper stories. Windows are for the most part
rectangular with an occasional round head or segmental arch and their height is greater
than their width. They are often 1 over 1, 2 over 2, and only occasionally 4 over 4.
D. Terminating Element - Most buildings have a terminating element at the roofline such as a
sheet metal cornice, corbeled masonry, or coping.
E. Roofline - Rooflines are flat or almost flat and not visible from the street.
F. Materials - The commercial buildings in downtown Hartford are for the most part of
masonry construction, either of dressed stone or common brick of a red, cream or buff
color. Brick is not wildly variegated but generally displays an evenness of tone. Building
surfaces appear visually as brick or stone, with recessed mortar joints.
G. Side Walls - In most cases buildings have abutting side walls or party walls.
H. Building Line - Buildings are generally placed immediately adjacent to the street right-ofway.
I. Relationship of Building to Lot - Generally buildings fill the lot.
IV. CATEGORIES OF PROPERTY IN THE DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
AND THE TYPE OF PRESERVATION TREATMENT REQUIRED
A. Intact Building - That building which still retains its original appearance. It requires
routine maintenance in conformity with the existing design to keep it in a satisfactory state
of preservation. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required for any action.
B. Altered Historic Building - That building which conforms in age, size, height, material and
character to others in the area but which has undergone stylistic modification. Restoration
or rehabilitation in keeping with or sympathetic to the original architectural style shall be
permitted. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required for any action.
C. Intrusion - That building which does not conform to the general character of the district in
architectural style, size, height, texture and material. It should remain until it is no longer
useful and eventually should be remodeled or replaced with a more compatible building
(see guidelines for new construction). A Certificate of Appropriateness is required for any
action.
D. Vacant Lot - A Certificate of Appropriateness is required before erecting a new building
on a vacant lot in an Historic District. (See guidelines for new construction.)
E. New Construction on a Lot Already Occupied - A Certificate of Appropriateness is
required before erecting an addition to an existing structure in the HAPEO District or
before beginning new construction on any lot already occupied.
14-14
V. GUIDELINES FOR REHABILITATION OR RESTORATION
A. Height - Alterations which create more than a one story difference between a building and
those on either side should not be permitted.
B. Major Facade -
1. Shopfronts
a) Shopfronts should be restored relying on historic photographs, original
drawings, physical evidence, and other documents and rehabilitated in keeping
with or sympathetic to the architectural style of the building.
b) Shopfronts should fit inside the original shopfront opening and should not
ordinarily be allowed to extend beyond the original opening.
c) Display windows should be restored to their original appearance or design
utilizing large sheets of glass in keeping with the architectural era. Small paned,
18th century windows should not ordinarily be permitted nor should solid or
translucent materials in place of windows.
2. Upper Story Windows
a) Upper story windows should be restored to their original appearance or be
rehabilitated to fit the original frame in a double hung one-over-one
arrangement.
b) Round or segmentally arched windows should contain window frames and panes
which follow the exterior configuration. A less desirable alternative of partial
blocking to form a rectangular opening may occur but--if proposed--should
block up the least possible amount of the opening to preserve to the greatest
extent possible, the original proportions of the window.
c) Upper story windows should not be block up.
d) Generally shutters should not be used and should only be considered when they
are appropriate to the architectural era and when their design is proportionately
and stylistically compatible with the building. Shutters may be used if there is
evidence that they were in the original building design.
e) Mill finish aluminum storm windows should not be used.
3. Cornices
Existing cornices should be retained and kept in good repair.
4. Roofs
a) Roofs are to be flat or gently sloping or otherwise not visible from the street.
b) Mansards, pents, gables, gambrels or other exotic roof shapes not characteristic
of the architectural era should not be allowed.
5. Other Sides
The Committee should be less rigorous in the application of these guidelines with
respect to secondary facades.
14-15
6. Guidelines
All guidelines shall not conflict with State Building Codes or energy conservation
codes.
Preservation treatments not compatible with the original character of the district as
specified in Sections II and III should not be favorably reviewed. For illustrative
purposes, examples of architectural styles which tend to have elements incompatible
with Hartford's historic styles include (with no attempt to be inclusive) Spanish
Mission Colonial, Scandinavian Modern, Bavarian, and French Provincial.
The Committee should produce and promote descriptive literature with photographs
and drawings, to assist owners and tenants in the district in planning to preserve and
enhance existing structures.
C. Materials -
1. Materials used in original construction should also be used in restoration. In
rehabilitation, materials that give the same visual appearance as existing original parts
of the building should be used. Generally, in Hartford, this is either brick or dressed
stone but in some cases, clapboard, board and batten or stucco, etc. may be in keeping
with original construction.
Brick and other materials used in restoration should be selected to conform to the
dimensions of existing-original materials. Brick should also conform in color, texture
and surface treatment to existing-original brick. Other materials should coordinate in
color, texture and surface treatment with nearby buildings.
2. Exposed aggregate, fieldstone, boulders, split rock, concrete or cinder block,
aggregate panels, aluminum, steel, or vinyl siding should not be permitted. Vertical
or horizontal board and batten, shingles, or clapboards should not be permitted unless
they are aesthetically acceptable and compatible with the style of the building and
nearby buildings.
3. Mortar Joints
The masonry wall should appear visually as masonry. In restoration, care should be
taken not to damage the brick thereby creating larger joints than were original to the
specific building. No exaggerated, uneven or oddly colored mortar joints should be
used. Mortar should not contrast vividly with the masonry.
4. Glazing
Clear or slightly tinted glass or polymeric glazing material should be used. No mirror
glass should be permitted. Glass blocks are also out of character and thus
inappropriate.
5. Materials and methods of construction which will lead to deterioration should be
avoided.
14-16
D. Cleaning or Painting -
1. Buildings should be cleaned with the gentlest method possible to accomplish the task,
therefore sandblasting should not be permitted on brick or soft stone surfaces.
2. Masonry buildings which have never been painted should not be painted unless
authorized by the Committee.
VI. GUIDELINES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION
A. General - Contemporary design is encouraged in new construction. New buildings should
correspond in height, width, proportion, relationship to street, roof forms, composition,
rhythm, proportion of openings, materials and color to the existing buildings in the district.
B. Height - Floor heights on main facades should appear visually in proportion to those of
adjoining buildings. There should be no more than one story difference between a new
building and those on either side. Buildings should be not more than three stories in
height.
C. Width - New buildings should reflect the characteristic rhythm of facades along the street.
If the site is large, the mass of the facade can be broken into a number of smaller bays. In
Hartford, these bays should be of no less than 20 feet nor more than 40 feet in width.
D. Proportion - The characteristic proportion (relationship between height and width) of
existing facades should be maintained.
E. Relationship to Street - New buildings should be built to the property lines like adjoining
buildings.
F. Roof Forms - Flat or gently sloping roofs, not visible from the street, should be used. Roof
forms should be similar to those on adjacent buildings. Mansards, pents, gables, gambrels,
or other out-of-character roof shapes should not be used. Roofs should not overhang.
G. Composition - The organization of the various parts of the facade should be similar to that
of surrounding facades. In this district the composition consists of:
1. A shopfront on the first floor which should contain display windows that are
aesthetically acceptable and compatible with the style of the building and nearby
buildings. In most cases, display windows should be large.
2. A traditional visual horizontal division between the first and second stories such as
corbelling, a string course, or contrasting stone.
3. Upper story windows should have a minimum height of 1-1/2 times their width and
be double hung one-over-one, two-over-two, or four-over-four.
4. Bay windows should be used only on upper stories.
14-17
5. A terminating feature such as a cornice, corbelled brick, a parapet, or coping stone
should complete the facade at the roofline.
H. Architectural Rhythm - Architectural rhythm which carries throughout the block (such as
window spacing) should be incorporated into new facades. In this district, on the first
floor, this suggests large expanses of display windows (no small paned windows should be
permitted) and on upper stories double hung, rectangular, round or segmentally arched
windows should be placed singly or in pairs.
I. Proportion of Openings - The size and proportion of window and door openings should be
similar to those on surrounding facades. The same applies to the ratio of window area to
solid wall for the facade as a whole. Where appropriate, soft fabric awnings should be
used for shade, color or style.
J. Materials - New construction in the Hartford Downtown Commercial HAPEO District
should be composed of materials which complement adjacent and nearby facades. New
buildings should not contrast sharply with others which meet the descriptions in Sections
II and III. For illustrative purposes, examples of architectural styles which would tend to
have elements which are incompatible with Hartford's historic styles (found in nearby
facades) include (with no attempt to be inclusive) Spanish Mission, Colonial,
Scandinavian Modern, Bavarian and French Provincial. In addition:
1. In this District, masonry (brick or stone) facing should normally be used. Brick
should be of standard size (8" x 2-1/3" x 4") and of even coloration. Exposed
aggregate, fieldstone, boulders, split rock, concrete or cinder block, aggregate panels,
aluminum, steel or vinyl siding should not be permitted. Vertical or horizontal board
or batten, shingles, or clapboards should be permitted only if aesthetically acceptable.
One suggestion of aesthetic acceptability would be evidence that non-masonry
construction was used on a previous building of the same approximate configuration
and style in the same location. Generally, though, non-masonry new construction
should be discouraged, and--if proposed--evidence of meeting Section VIII of
Chapter 14 may be requested.
2. Mortar Joints--Masonry walls should appear visually as masonry--not as joints. No
oversize mortar joints, skintling, or other uncommon joints should be permitted.
Black mortar or other mortar which contrasts with the masonry should not be used.
3. Glazing--Clear or slightly tinted glass or polymeric glazing materials should be used.
No mirror glass, deeply smoked glass or glass blocks should be permitted.
K. Color - Colors chosen for new construction should correspond to those of neighboring
buildings within the block or the District. (See facade renderings by R. Hartmann 1980-
1982.)
L. Guidelines - All guidelines shall not conflict with state building codes or energy
conservation codes. The Committee should produce and promote descriptive literature,
with photographs and drawings, to assist property owners in the district in planning new
construction which is complementary with existing facades.
14-18
M. Signs - Signs convey necessary information, and, if harmonious, add to the visual
character of place. They should be easy to read and unobtrusive. Signs should not obscure
architectural details of a building.
Each sign should be integrated with the building's facade, and requires individual attention
to design. Multiple signs intended for the same structure should be designed as a unified
scheme.
The booklet Sign Design: Guidelines for signs in Hartford's Historic District shall be used
as a general guide for the design evaluation of signs in any historic district. (SECTION M.
CREATED 4/12/94--ORDINANCE NO. E-259)
N. Modern Fixtures - TV antennas and similar receptacles shall be placed on roofs toward the
rear, and should not project above the roof crest if possible.
Utility meters should be placed on foundation walls as low as feasible. Above-ground
service connections should be to the rear of the property.
Room air-conditioning apparatus should be positioned to the side or rear, where it is least
visible. Where this cannot be accomplished, the device should be put in an existing
window, without disturbing the trim. Any infill of window space around the device should
be accomplished with opaque, weather-resistant material, and should be painted to match
the trim color of the window.
Modern fixtures are generally considered to disfigure historic structures. However, they
do have important functions, and if well designed, need be no more disturbing then the
fixtures of the past. (SECTION N. CREATED 4/12/94--ORDINANCE NO. E-259)
VII. DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
A. Mapping - The boundaries of the proposed Downtown Commercial HAPEO District shall
be those on EXHIBIT A attached hereto.

ZONING ORDINANCE
16.01 -- STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, TITLE
AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
16.0101 Statutory Authorization
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in ss. 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and
cities; 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in s. 87.30, Stats.
16.0102 Finding of Fact
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would
impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
16.0103 Statement of Purpose
This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(1) Protect life, health and property;
(2) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(3) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(4) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(6) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(7) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(8) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts
between property owners; and
(9) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the
activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
16.0104 Title
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Hartford,
Wisconsin.
16-2
16.0105 General Provisions
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR.
Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and
are shown as AE, A1-30 and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A
and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more
than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps
based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations
(BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the
Letter of Map Change process (see s. 8.0 Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to
RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and
revisions are on file in the office of the Planning & Zoning Office, City of Hartford. If more than
one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(a) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on the FIS.
(b) Official Maps: Based on other studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be
approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the
proposed development. (AMENDED 4/15/2014-ORDINANCE NO. 1309; AMENDED 6/23/2015—ORDINANCE NO.
1328; AMENDED 10/13/15—ORDINANCE NO. 1334)
1. City of Hartford Flood Storage Map, Panel number 3 of 8, dated October 16, 2015.
Prepared and approved by WDNR.
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into four districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are
contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the
floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater
during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined,
including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
(d) The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters
is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge.
16-3
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field
conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subd (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference
exists, the map shall be amended according to s. 8.0 Amendments. The zoning administrator
can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit,
whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible
for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district
boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section.
Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line
shall be settled according to s. 7.3(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood
profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any
map amendment or revision pursuant to s. 8.0 Amendments.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district
boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any
discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale.
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from
the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the
fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 8.0
Amendments.
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance
with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to
comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and
repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt
when s. 30.2022, Stats., applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted
under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s. 62.23 for cities; s. 61.35 for villages; or s.
87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in
full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions,
16-4
covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of
this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum
requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or
repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance,
required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of
the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of
the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and
research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or
permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does
not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(11) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.
(12) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES
The Dodge and/or Washington County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed
areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements
of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain
zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section

all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood resistant materials; be constructed to minimize
flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions
of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All
subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood
elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this
ordinance and all other requirements in s. 7.1(2). Adequate drainage shall be provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,

by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height,
or
(b) Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost.
(2) The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development
will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially
adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of s. 8.0 Amendments are met.
16.0202 Watercourse Alterations
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued
until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and
FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal
permits. The standards of s. 2.1 must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or
relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse
alteration or relocation and pursuant to s. 8.0 Amendments, the community shall apply for a
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and
approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process.

(1) Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal or greater than
0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional flood.
(2) No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal
volume of storage as defined by the pre=development ground surface and the regional
flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to
compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory storage). Excavation
below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage.
(3) If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the
entire area zoned as flood storage district – on this waterway – is rezoned to the
floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done
for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without
floodplain storage, as per 16.08 (Amendments) of this ordinance.

developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at
transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each
location.
v. the most current version of HEC RAS shall be used.
vi. a survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each
structure.
vii. additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits
of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based
on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet.
viii. standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning
parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning’s N values, expansion
and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be
calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the
reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available,
adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard
accepted engineering practices.
ix. the model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing
and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The
height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study
profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet.

ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin Code, Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional
Flood Elevation and the following:
i. Duplicate Effective Model – The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure
correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised
data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised
reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated
that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the Floodway Data
Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.
ii. Corrected Effective Model – The corrected effective model shall not include any
man-made physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the
model into the most current version of Hec-Rad for department review.
iii. Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model – The Existing Model shall be required to

supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans
and survey notes.
vi. Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which
the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downsteam of the
revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in water
surface elevation and top widths computed by the revised models matching those
in the effective models upstream and downstream of the revised reach as
required. The Effective Model shall not be truncated.
c. Mapping – Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the
Department for review which meet the following conditions:
i. Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the revised floodplain and
floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles, topographic work map,
associated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary Floodway Maps (FBFMs), construction
16-24
plans, bridge plans.
ii. Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour interval, and a planimetric
map showing the applicable items. If a digital version of the map is available, it
may be submitted in order that the FIRM may be more easily revised.
iii. Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised 1% and 0.2% annual chance
floodplains and floodway boundaries.
iv. If an annotated FIRM and//or FBFM and digital mapping data (GIS or CADD) are
used then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the
data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection

piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on
the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE - Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or
16-40
temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including,
but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and
culverts.
SUBDIVISION - Has the meaning given in s. 236.02(12), Wis. Stats.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE - Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the
equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT – Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the
equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the
structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either
any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or
safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to

CHAPTER 20
EROSION CONTROL AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
STORMWATER ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION
ARTICLE I: EROSION CONTROL AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
20.01 AUTHORITY. (1) This chapter is adopted by the Common Council under the
authority granted by §62.234, Wis. Stats. This chapter supersedes all conflicting and contradictory
regulations previously enacted by Hartford relating to stormwater management and construction site
erosion control.
(2) Building Inspector is the Administrative Authority for the Erosion Control Provisions of
this chapter on private property and the City Engineer is the Administrative Authority for the erosion
control provisions of this Chapter within the public rights-of-way and for the Stormwater Control
Provisions of this chapter, to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Enforcement
provisions are described further under sec. 20.14 of this chapter.
20.02 FINDINGS OF FACT. (1) The Common Council finds that construction site
erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land disturbing construction activities have
significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of
the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, soil
erosion and stormwater runoff can:
(a) Carry a significant amount of sediment, nutrients, bacteria/other pathogens, organic matter,
toxins and other pollutants to local lakes, streams and wetlands;
(b) Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses, and a
natural diversity of plant and animal life;
(c) Clog drainage systems with sediment, which in turn increases maintenance costs;
(d) Overwhelm existing drainage ways with increased flows, causing bank and channel erosion, and
increasing downstream flooding and property damage;
(e) Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows and/or lower water levels
in local lakes, ponds and wetlands; and
(f) Contaminate drinking water supplies.
(g) Generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other
off-site damage to property or the environment.
20.03 PURPOSE AND INTENT. (1) Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth
requirements for land disturbing construction activities aimed to minimize sedimentation, water
pollution, flooding and related property and environmental damage caused by soil erosion and
uncontrolled stormwater runoff during and after construction, in order to diminish the threats to
public health, safety, welfare, and the natural resources of Hartford.
(2) Intent. This chapter is intended to regulate construction site erosion and stormwater
20 - 1
management under the authority granted in §62.234, Wis. Stats., and is intended to meet the current
construction site erosion control and post-construction stormwater management regulatory
requirements of Subchapter III of both NR 151 and NR 216 Wis. Adm. Code. This chapter is not
intended to limit activity or land divisions permitted under the applicable zoning and land division
ordinances.
(3) Regional Stormwater Management. The City recognizes that the preferred method of
permanently managing stormwater runoff from land disturbing construction activities is through the
preparation and implementation of regional stormwater management plans by watershed areas which
are designed to meet the requirements of this chapter. Accordingly, provisions have been
incorporated into this chapter to allow for the implementation of this type of plan in lieu of
complying with certain on-site stormwater management requirements.
20.04 JURISDICTION. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands within the
City of Hartford.

2. Any roadway construction or other land disturbing or land development activity by the City.
(4) Technical Waiver. (a) Waiver Criteria. Following the provisions of this subsection, the
Administering Authority may waive a site or a portion of a site from meeting certain technical
requirements of this section if the Administering Authority determines that one or more of the
following applies:
1. Off-Site Best Management Practices [hereinafter BMP(s)]. Off-site BMPs may be used
(under the technical waiver) as long as they meet State water quality standards and DNR
technical standards. The requirement has been satisfied through the use of off-site BMP(s).
Off-site BMP(s) could be installed beyond the boundaries of the property covered by the
application as part of a regional stormwater management plan or through other legal
arrangements. However, to be eligible for this waiver, the off-site BMP(s) must treat runoff
from the site covered by the application; or
2. No Off-Site Impacts. The site will have no appreciable off-site impacts or is internally
drained and will not discharge runoff from the site after development occurs; or
3. Site Conditions. It is impracticable to meet the requirement due to site conditions such as:
slopes; soils; proximity to existing or proposed structures or desirable trees; limited site
dimensions; existing or proposed land uses on site or on surrounding sites; the potential for
groundwater contamination; potential subsurface flow paths to existing or proposed
buildings, structures, or public infrastructure; public health or safety problems; or other
factors beyond the control of the applicant. No site shall be entitled to a waiver under this
paragraph due solely to the size of the proposed land disturbing construction activity in
relation to the parcel size; or
20 - 4
4. Compliance would be in direct conflict with other regulations or related objectives of this
chapter which would take precedent.
(b) Application for Technical Waiver. A technical waiver under sub. (a) above may only be granted
by the Administering Authority upon the applicant submitting all of the following items to the
Administering Authority, which shall constitute a completed application:
1. A written request describing the provisions of this subsection for which a waiver is being
requested and an explanation of why;
2. A site plan in accordance with sec. 20.09(5)(b) of this chapter, including the delineation of
the area and size (in acres) to which the waiver would apply and any other stormwater
BMP(s) required to meet this chapter or as recommended in a regional stormwater
management plan;
3. The necessary technical documentation to demonstrate that the site meets one or more of
the criteria for which a waiver is being applied, including documentation of the applicable
provisions of any regional stormwater management plan that may be involved;
4. For off-site BMP(s) under sub. (a)1. above:
a. Documentation that the necessary BMP(s) have been properly installed, including asbuilt
plans, construction certification and design summaries in accordance with sec.
20.11(4) of this chapter;
b. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement in accordance with sec. 20.12 of this
chapter and any other easements or legal arrangement that may be involved to ensure the
long-term maintenance of the off-site BMP(s).
c. Documentation of payment of any applicable fees that may be required by a unit of
government charged with implementing a regional stormwater management plan. Fees
may be through a stormwater utility district or other unit of government and would
usually be based on an equitable distribution of costs for land acquisition, engineering
design, construction, certification and maintenance of stormwater BMP(s) implemented
through the regional stormwater management plan.
5. Other materials that the Administering Authority determines to be necessary to make a
determination under this subsection or to comply with this chapter.
(c) Review Procedure. The Administering Authority shall review all technical waiver application
materials submitted under sub. (b) above, determine compliance with this section and notify the
applicant of a decision within 20 working days of the submittal date, in accordance with the
procedures under 20.07(2) below. In consideration of all waiver requests, the Administering
Authority shall ensure that the applicant meets the requirements of this section to the maximum
extent practicable.
(d) Appeal. If the applicant does not agree with any written determination of the Administering
Authority under this subsection, the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to the
procedures in sec. 20.15.
20 - 5

20.08 EROSION CONTROL PLAN REQUIREMENTS. (1) General Requirements.
(a) An erosion control plan shall ensure, to the extent practical, that soil erosion, siltation,
sedimentation and other off-site impacts from land disturbing construction activities are
minimized. Measures shall be taken, using approved best management practices, to minimize
sediment from being carried off-site by water or wind during the construction phase, such as:
diversions, silt fence, straw bales, downspout extenders, soil treatment, temporary mulch,
sediment traps, sediment basins, etc. All temporary best management practices shall be
maintained until the site is stabilized. Some best management practices, such as sediment
basins, may be designed to also serve as a permanent stormwater best management practice after
the site is stabilized.
(b) All erosion control plans and associated best management practices shall comply with the
planning, design, implementation and maintenance requirements of this chapter.
(2) Guiding Principles. To satisfy the requirements of this section, all proposed land
disturbing construction activities shall, to the extent practical:
(a) Be planned and implemented in a manner that best fits the terrain of the site, avoiding steep
slopes and other environmentally sensitive areas;
(b) Minimize soil compaction, the loss of trees and other natural vegetation and the size of the
disturbed area;
(c) Minimize, through project phasing and proper construction sequencing, the time the disturbed
soil surface is exposed to erosive forces; and
(d) Emphasize the use of erosion control measures that prevent soil detachment and erosion rather
than trying to intercept its transport or repair damage done.
(3) Specific Erosion Control Requirements and Performance Standards. Unless otherwise
technically waived under sec. 20.05(4) of this chapter, the following minimum requirements shall be
met on all sites subject to the applicability criteria under sec. 20.05(1) of this chapter and shall be
addressed in the erosion control plan submitted by the applicant, if applicable. The administering
authority is authorized to exceed the minimum requirements stated below for any site that the
administering authority determines is a high risk of soil erosion or may significantly impact an
environmentally sensitive area, and that further controls are practical.
(a) Sediment Reduction. An erosion control plan shall by its design to the maximum extent
practicable, achieve a reduction of 80% of the sediment load carried in runoff, on an average
annual basis, as compared with no sediment or erosion controls, until the site is stabilized.
Erosion and sediment control best management practices may be used alone or in any
combination to meet the 80% sediment reduction goal. Plans that comply with the guiding
principles described in sub. (2) above and the specific erosion control plan requirements
described below shall be determined by the Administering Authority as meeting the 80%
sediment reduction goal.
20 - 9
1. Notwithstanding par. (a), if BMP(s) cannot be designed and implemented to reduce the
sediment load by 80%, on an average annual basis, the plan shall include a written and sitespecific
explanation as to why the 80% reduction goal is not attainable and the sediment
load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
(b) Construction Material Handling. The use, storage and disposal of chemicals, cement and other
compounds and materials used on the construction site shall be managed during the construction
period, to prevent their entrance into waters of the state. However, projects that require the
placement of these materials in waters of the state, such as constructing bridge footings of BMP
installations, are not prohibited by this paragraph.
(c) Access Drives and Tracking. Each site shall provide an access drive(s) and parking area, of
sufficient dimensions and design, surfaced with a material that will prevent erosion and
minimize tracking or washing of soil onto public or private roadways. All non-paved access
drives shall be designed so that stormwater runoff from adjacent areas does not flow down the
drive surface. Culverts shall be sized for calculated peak flows produced by the 10-year 24-hour
design storm and shall meet all other State and local requirements relating to roadway access.
(d) Diversion of Upslope Runoff. Any significant amount of runoff from upslope land area,
rooftops or other surfaces that drains across the proposed land disturbance shall be diverted
around the disturbed area, if practical. Any diversion of upslope runoff shall be done in a
manner that prevents erosion of the flow path and the outlet.
(e) Cut and Fill Slopes. Any cuts and fills shall be planned and constructed to minimize the length
and steepness of slope, and stabilized in accordance with the approved erosion control plan
timelines and technical standards of this chapter.
(f) Open Channels. Any open channels shall be designed and constructed to carry the calculated
peak flows for a 10-year 24-hour design storm, and stabilized in accordance with the approved
technical standards identified in sec. 20.10 of this chapter.
(g) Inlet Protection. All inlets to storm drains, culverts and other stormwater conveyance systems
shall be protected from siltation until final site stabilization.
(h) Outlet Protection. All outlets for site dewatering and stormwater conveyance systems, including
pipe or open channels entering a stormwater management facility, shall be protected from
erosion through channel lining or other stabilization measures.
(i) Dust Control. Prevent excessive dust from leaving the construction site through construction
phasing and timely stabilization or the use of best management practices such as site watering
and mulch – especially with very dry or find sandy soils.
(j) Site Dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by sediment basins or other
approved measures to prevent soil erosion and water pollution.
(k) Waste and Material Disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including garbage,
debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous materials) shall be properly
disposed of and not allowed to be carried off-site by runoff or wind.
20 - 10
(l) Topsoil. Enough topsoil from the disturbed area must be saved to ensure that a minimum of 4
to 6 inches is reapplied for all areas to be seeded or sodded. If adequate topsoil does not exist
on the site to meet this requirement, it shall be imported. If the disturbed area is to be used for
the growing of agricultural crops in the future, the original depth of topsoil shall be restored.
(m) Overland Flow. Trap sediment in overland flow before discharge from the site using best
management practices such as silt fence and vegetation filter strips.
(n) Soil Stockpiles. Soil stockpiles shall be located no closer than 25 feet from lakes, streams,
wetlands, ditches, drainage ways, curbs/gutters or other stormwater conveyance system, unless
otherwise approved by the administering authority. Measures shall be taken to minimize
erosion and runoff from any soil stockpiles that will likely remain for more than 5 working days.
Any soil stockpile that remains for more than 30 days shall be covered or treated with stabilization
practices such as temporary or permanent seeding and mulching.
(o) Sediment Cleanup. All off-site sediment deposits occurring as a result of construction work or a
storm event shall be cleaned up by the end of each day. Flushing shall not be allowed.
(p) Final Site Stabilization. All previous cropland areas where land disturbing construction
activities will not be occurring under the proposed grading plan, shall be stabilized within 30
days of permit issuance. All disturbed areas shall be treated with stabilization measures such as
seeding, mulching, soil treatment, erosion netting, matting, sodding, etc. within 7 working days
of final grading. Large sites shall be treated in stages as final grading is completed in each
stage. Any soil erosion that occurs after final grading and/or the application of stabilization
measures must be repaired and the stabilization work redone.
(q) Temporary Site Stabilization. For any disturbed area that remains inactive for greater than 10
working days, or where grading work extends beyond the permanent seeding deadlines
established by the Land Conservation Committee, the administering authority may require the
site to be treated with temporary stabilization measures such as soil treatment, temporary
seeding and/or mulching in addition to other erosion control measures as part of an approved
erosion control plan. Frozen soils do not exclude the site from this requirement.
(r) Removal of Practices. When the disturbed area has been stabilized by permanent vegetation or
other means, temporary best management practices such as silt fences, straw bales and sediment
traps shall be removed and these areas stabilized.
(4) Final Erosion Control Plan Contents. (a) Sites of Less than One Acre of Total Land
Disturbance. The following shall be the minimum requirements for items to be included in a final
erosion control plan:
1. A scaled drawing of the site with a north arrow, delineation of the proposed land
disturbance, existing and proposed buildings, roadways, access drives, property boundaries,
drainage ways, water bodies, trees, culverts, and other structures within 50 feet of the
proposed land disturbance;
2. The direction and steepness of slopes before and after the proposed land disturbance;
3. A description and location of all temporary best management practices proposed to be used
20 - 11
to minimize off-site impacts during the construction phase;
4. A description and location of all permanent best management practices proposed to be used
to stabilize the site within 3 working days following construction;
5. The name(s), address and day time phone number(s) of the person(s) charged with installing
and maintaining all best management practices and thus subject to the enforcement provisions
of sec. 20.14 of this chapter; and
6. Other information determined to be necessary by the administering authority to ensure
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(b) Sites of One Acre or Greater in Total Land Disturbance. The following shall be the minimum
requirements for items to be included in an erosion control plan:

management plan, an application shall be deemed as meeting the stormwater management
planning requirements of this chapter.
(c) As a condition of an erosion and runoff control permit, the applicant may be required to pay a
fee or meet other requirements, as determined by the applicable entity charged with the
implementation of the regional stormwater management plan. Any fee would be based on an
equitable distribution of the cost for land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance of
stormwater management practices needed to serve the land development through the regional
stormwater management plan.
(3) Guiding Principles. To satisfy the requirements of this section, unless otherwise
technically waived under sec. 20.05(4) of this chapter, all proposed land disturbing construction
activities shall, to the extent practical:
(a) Be planned and implemented in a manner that best fits the terrain of the site, avoiding steep
slopes and other environmentally sensitive areas;
(b) Preserve natural watershed boundaries and drainage patterns;
(c) Maintain groundwater recharge areas and the infiltration capacity of native soils by avoiding the
unnecessary filling of large natural depressions or compaction of upper soil horizons by
construction equipment;
(d) Utilize natural or constructed vegetated swales or reinforced permeable open channels for
stormwater conveyance and attenuation;
(e) Minimize impervious surfaces and have them drain to vegetated areas for flow attenuation,
pollutant filtering and groundwater recharge; and
(f) Reserve adequately sized areas to allow for detention of flows and treatment of pollutants from
stormwater before being discharged from the site.
(4) Specific Stormwater Management Requirements and Performance Standards. Except
where provided for under sub.(2) above, or technically waived under sec. 20.05(4) of this chapter,
the following minimum requirements shall be met on all sites subject to the applicability criteria
under 20.05(2) of this chapter and shall be addressed in the stormwater management plan submitted
by the applicant, if applicable. The Administering Authority is authorized to exceed the minimum
requirements stated below for any site that the Administering Authority determines is a high risk of
soil erosion or may significantly impact an environmentally sensitive area, and that further controls
are practical.
(a) Total Suspended Solids. A stormwater management plan, by design, shall meet the following
20 - 15
post-development total suspended solids reduction targets, based on average annual rainfalls, as
compared to no runoff management controls.
1. For new land development, 80% reduction in total suspended solids load;
2. For redevelopment, 40% reduction of total suspended solids load;
3. For in-fill development that occurs prior to October 1, 2012, 40% reduction total suspended
solids load;
4. For in-fill development that occurs after October 1, 2012, 80% reduction of total suspended
solids load.
5. Notwithstanding sub. 1 - 4, if the design cannot achieve the applicable total suspended
solids reductions specified, the stormwater management plan shall include a written and
site-specific explanation why that level of reduction is not attained and the total suspended
solids load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. In such case a technical
waiver in accordance with sec. 20.05(4) must be obtained for sites not meeting sub. 1 - 4
above.
(b) Peak Discharge. 1. To minimize streambank erosion and the failure of downstream conveyance
systems, the post-development peak flow discharge rates of stormwater runoff shall not exceed
the calculated pre-development discharge rates for both the 2-year 24-hour and the 10-year
24-hour design storms in accordance with the standards in sec. 20.10(1) of this chapter.
1. This subsection of the chapter does not apply to any of the following:
a. A post-construction site where the change in hydrology due to development does not
increase the existing surface water elevation at any point within the downstream
receiving water by more than 0.01 of a foot for the 2-year, 24-hour storm event.
b. A redevelopment post-construction site.
c. An in-fill development area less than 5 acres.
(c) Infiltration. BMP(s) shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in
accordance with the requirements listed in the following sections. Infiltration areas shall be
designed to minimize impacts on: roadways; public infrastructure or private laterals; existing or
proposed building sites, foundations or basements.
1. For residential developments, infiltrate the runoff volume from the pre development 2-year
24 hour design storm with a type II distribution to the maximum extent practicable.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more
than 2% of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area. Should either of the
volumes in sub 2.a. or 2.b. be more restrictive than this section, the greater volume shall be
used.
2. When site constraints do not allow for appropriate infiltration systems, technical waivers
may be sought in accordance with sec. 20.05(4); however, one of the following infiltration
20 - 16
minimums shall be met:
a. Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall
be at least 90% of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
requirement, no more than 1% of the project site is required as an effective infiltration
area, or
b. Infiltrate 25% of the post-development runoff volume from the 2-year, 24-hour design
storm with a type II distribution. Separate runoff curve numbers for pervious and
impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff volumes, not composite curve
numbers, as defined in TR-55. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems
to meet this requirement, no more than 1% of the project site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
3. For non-residential development, including commercial, industrial and institutional
development, infiltrate the runoff volume from the post development 1-year 24 hour design
storm with a type II distribution to the maximum extent practicable. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than 4% of the
project site is required as an effective infiltration area. Should either of the volumes in sub
4.a. or 4.b. be more restrictive than this section, the greater volume shall be used.
4. When site constraints do not allow for appropriate infiltration systems, technical waivers
may be sought in accordance with sec. 20.05(4); however, one of the following infiltration
minimums shall be met when practicable:
a. Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall
be at least 60% of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
requirement, no more than 2% of the project site is required as an effective infiltration
area, or
b. Infiltrate 10% of the post-development runoff volume from the 2-year, 24-hour design
storm. Separate curve numbers for pervious and impervious surfaces shall be used to
calculate runoff volumes, not composite curve numbers, as defined in TR-55. However,
when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than
2% of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area.
5. Modeling. Refer to sec. 20.10(1)(a) for details on calculating runoff volumes from pre and
post-development conditions.
6. Pretreatment. Pretreatment shall be required before infiltrating parking lot and roadway
runoff from commercial, industrial and institutional areas. The pretreatment shall be
designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and
to protect groundwater quality in accordance with sub. 10 below. Pretreatment options may
include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separators, sedimentation or bioretention basins,
filtration swales or filter strips. All designs shall comply with the technical standards in sec.
20.10(2) of this chapter.
20 - 17

shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section.
10. Groundwater protection.
a. Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this subsection shall, to the extent
technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to
groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of
standards application in accordance with ch. NR 140 Wis. Adm. Code. However, if sitespecific
information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not
achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent
infiltration to the maximum extent practicable.
b. The discharge from BMP(s) shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of
standards application.
c. No stormwater BMP shall be installed that meets the definition of an injection well under
ch. NR 812.05 Wis. Adm. Code.
d. All stormwater BMP(s) shall comply with the provisions of any applicable wellhead
protection plan for a community water supply under ch. NR 811 Wis. Adm. Code.
(d) Protective Areas. Protective area means an area of land that commences at the top of the
channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the
greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of channel or delineated
wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section, “protective area”
does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such
that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location.
1. For outstanding resource waters as listed in s. NR 102.10, Wis. Adm. Code and exceptional
resource waters listed in s. NR 102.11, Wis. Adm. Code, and for wetlands in areas of special
natural resource interest as specified in s. NR 103.04 Wis. Adm. Code, 75 feet.

prairies, conifer swamps, shrub swamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows,
shallow marshes, deep marshes and seasonally flooded basins. Wetland boundary
delineations shall be made in accordance with ch. NR 103 Wis. Adm. Code. This paragraph
does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable
state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled
in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the
wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed.
20 - 19
5. For less susceptible wetlands, 10 percent of the average wetland width, but no less than 10
feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated
by invasive species such as reed canary grass.
6. In subd. (4)(d)4 & (4)(d)5, determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to
wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the
wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in Chapter NR 103 Wis. Adm. Code.
7. For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, 10 feet.
(e) Requirements within Protective Areas. The following requirements shall be met for all land
disturbing construction activity located within a protective area:

applicable regulation, the most restive requirement shall apply.
2. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area, except for boathouses and
walkways authorized under shoreland and floodplain zoning. The erosion control plan shall
contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are
disturbed during construction.
3. Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, and where no
impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining non-invasive, flood and
drought tolerant vegetation cover of 70% or greater shall be established and maintained.
The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetation cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank
stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow
areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetation materials, such as rock riprap, may be
employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high
velocity flows occur.
4. Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, that are
designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area,
but shall not encroach into wetlands, floodplains, primary or secondary environmental
corridors.
5. Protective Area Exemptions. The following sites are exempted from meeting this
subsection.
a. Redevelopment post-construction sites.
b. In-fill development areas less than 5 acres.
c. Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts;

(f) Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance Areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall have
BMP(s) designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the
runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen.
(g) Protection of Wetlands. Stormwater discharges shall minimize the hydrologic changes and
pollutant loadings to wetlands, to the extent practical, in order to preserve the wetland functional
values. All discharges to wetlands shall require the same protection as pars. (a) and (b) above,
unless otherwise approved by any other applicable regulatory agency and the administering
authority in accordance with technical standards adopted under sec. 20.10 of this chapter. If any
land disturbing construction activity is proposed in a wetland as part of a final stormwater
management plan, the administering authority may require all other applicable permits to be
obtained prior to the issuance of an erosion and runoff control permit.
(h) Site Drainage. Measures shall be implemented to ensure proper site drainage, prevent property
damage and protect public health and safety, including the following minimum requirements:
1. Drainage easement. Perpetual drainage easements or other deed restrictions shall be
recorded on the property to preserve major stormwater flow paths and permanent
stormwater BMP locations. Covenants in these areas shall not allow buildings, other
structures, prevent any grading, filling or other activities that interrupt or obstruct flows in
any way. Covenants shall also specify maintenance responsibilities and authorities in
accordance with sec. 20.12.
2. Site grading. Site grading shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, positive flows
away from all buildings, roadways, driveways and septic systems, be coordinated with the
general stormwater drainage patterns for the area, and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent
properties.
3. Subsurface drainage. No discharge of groundwater from tile lines, sump pumps or other
means shall be allowed onto another persons land or any public space without the written
approval of the owner or unit of government. The Administering Authority shall be notified
of any drain tiles that are uncovered during construction, which the Administering Authority
may require to be restored or connected to other drainage systems.
4. Structure protection and safety. For buildings designed for human occupation on a regular
basis, the following additional requirements shall apply:
a. The lowest elevation of the structure that is exposed to the ground surface that is
hydrological connected to any stormwater BMP shall be a minimum of two (2) feet
above the maximum water elevation produced by the 100-year, 24 hour design storm,
including flows through any stormwater BMP that may temporarily or permanently store
water at a depth of greater than one (1) foot not including conveyance systems; and
b. For internally drained areas the maximum water elevation shall be determined using the
volume produced by the 100-year 24 hour design storm with a NRCS runoff curve
number of 98 for the entire watershed, to reflect frozen ground conditions.
c. The structure shall be setback at least 20 feet from any stormwater BMP that may
20 - 21
temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one (1) foot not
including conveyance systems. Setback distance shall be measured from the closest edge
of water at the elevation produced by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm.
5. Additional Requirements. The Administering Authority may establish more stringent
requirements than the minimums set forth in this section, such as addressing thermal
impacts of stormwater or chronic wetness conditions, if the Administering Authority
determines that an added level of protection is needed.
(i) Flooding. All stormwater management facilities shall have the capacity to safely handle the
calculated peak flow rates for a 100-year 24-hour design storm without structural failure, bank
erosion, loss of freeboard or other problems. At a minimum, an emergency spillway must be
provided to carry these flows.

conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
20.57 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
1. Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The Authorized Enforcement
Agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to
the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Authorized Enforcement Agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
2. Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in
violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Authorized Enforcement Agency will notify a violator
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Authorized
Enforcement Agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated

owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural
BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of
an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and
20 - 42
non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm
sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid WPDES permit authorizing the
discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the WPDES permit.
20.61 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION. (1) Every person owning property through which
a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse

may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or
water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Authorized
Enforcement Agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
Authorized Enforcement Agency within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken
to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

purpose and intent of this ordinance is to prohibit graffiti vandalism, and to provide a
procedure requiring the removal of graffiti from property within the City of Hartford. Graffiti
contributes to blight and deterioration of surrounding properties, and reduces the physical
attractiveness to the neighborhoods, and is detrimental to the City. Graffiti constitutes a public
nuisance and must be abated promptly in order to alleviate the detrimental impact it has on
the neighborhoods, businesses, surrounding properties, and citizens and the City of Hartford, in
general.
(2) Graffiti Vandalism Prohibited. (a) Graffiti Defined. "Graffiti" means any inscription,
word, figure or design, marked, scratched, etches, drawn or painted with spray paint, liquid

or mark of any type on any public or private building or other real or personal property
owned, operated or maintained by any private person or public entity, agency, firm or
corporation, unless the express permission of the owner or operator has been obtained.
This shall not be construed to prohibit the placement of temporary and easily removable
chalk or other water soluble markings on public or private streets, sidewalks or other
paved surfaces incident to youth activities such as hopscotch and various types of ball
games or any lawful business activity.
(c) Penalty. 1. Any person who violates subsection 22.07(2)(b) shall be subject to a
forfeiture of not less than $500 per violation, in addition to any applicable fees,
assessments and costs of prosecution. In addition, any person who shall cause physical
damage to or destroy any public property shall be liable for the costs of replacing or
repairing such damaged or destroyed property.
2. Parental Liability. Pursuant to Section 895.035, Wisconsin Statutes, the parent(s) of an

agency, firm or corporation who is the owner of any real or personal property where graffiti
exists as defined in 22.07(2)(a) of this chapter, may maintain or allow any graffiti to remain
upon such property for a period of more than ten (10) days.
(b) Abatement Notification. 1. Upon official and written notification, the Building Inspection
Department shall, within five (5) days of receiving said notification, serve any property
owner whose property has been affected by the application of graffiti, a written Notice to
Abate requiring the property owner to remove, restore, clean up or repair such property
within ten (10) days of the date of such Notice.
Content of Notice to Abate. The Notice shall identify the property affected, shall
generally describe the location of the graffiti and direct that the graffiti be removed
within ten (10) days of receipt of the Notice to Abate. The Notice shall also include that if
the owner fails to remove graffiti within the time specified in the Notice, the owner may
be subject to a forfeiture as provided in subsection (c).
2. Such Notice may be served personally by the Building Inspector or his/her authorized
representative, or by registered, certified or regular mail, and service upon any one of
joint or in-common owners shall constitute valid service upon all property owners.
22-8
(c) Penalty. 1. Any person, entity, agency, firm or corporation who violates this section shall
be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $25, nor more than $500, together with the
cost of prosecution.
2. A violation of this section exists on the date that the citation is issued and continues to
exist until remedied. Each day in which a violation continues shall be determined a
separate and distinct offense.
3. Payment of a monetary forfeiture does not relieve the owner or operator of the
property of the duty to abate the graffiti nuisance.
4. If, after thirty (30) days upon receipt of Notice to Abate, the property owner or operator
fails to comply with the terms of said Notice, in addition to the penalties set forth under
this subsection, the City may cause the removal, restoration, clean up or repair of such
property affected by the graffiti. Pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.60(16), the
City may impose a special charge for services reflecting the actual costs of graffiti
removal against the property.
(4) Severability. The terms and provisions of this ordinance are severable. Should any
term or provision of this ordinance be found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect. (SECTION 22.07 CREATED
6/13/00--ORDINANCE NO. E-436)
22.08 RESIDENCY AND SAFETY RESTRICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENDERS. The Wisconsin
Statutes govern the punishment of individuals who commit sex crimes. The City of Hartford has

residency restrictions and the limited exemptions enumerated in Wisconsin § 980.135 for sex

protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the children and citizens of the City of

residences. The City finds and declares that sex offenders who prey upon children are a serious
threat to public safety and it is necessary for the City to enact reasonable measures to reduce
the opportunity and minimize the risk of re-offense by protecting children where they
congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near
schools and other places children frequent.

take such steps necessary to make the determination, and shall collect the cost
therefore from the Property Owner, including by imposition of a special charge.
b. If the customer-side service line is found to be constructed of lead, the Property Owner
will be notified in writing of that fact, along with notification that the Property Owner
must replace the customer-side service line or the City will replace the customer-side
service line as part of the project.
c. For any project involving the replacement of Utility-side service lines, the City shall
request unit bid prices for the calculation of the cost of the replacement of customerside

h. Disputes regarding eligibility for financing may be appealed to the Utility Committee.
The decision of the Committee is final.
(8) Severability. If any subsection or portion of this ordinance is for any reason determined to
be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, that
subsection or portion shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity of the
remaining subsection or portions of this ordinance.
(9) Authority to Discontinue Service. As an alternative to any other methods provided for

REPEALED AND RECREATED 8/13/91-- ORDINANCE NO. E-182)
25.06 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. (1) Basis for Sewer Service Charges: The sewer
service charge shall be based on the Sewer Use Charge. If any user of the sewer system procures
any part or all of his water from sources other than the Water Utility, the user shall furnish,
install and maintain at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the Water Utility for the
purpose of determining the volume of sewage discharged to the sewer system as described in
Section 25.13. At the discretion of the City a user procuring water from other sources than the
Water Utility may be assigned a Residential Equivalent Connection (REC) to be used as a basis
for the sewer use charge as determined from Section 25.19. If in the opinion of the Plant &
Collection Systems Director, the information in Section 25.19 does not accurately reflect the
user's wastewater discharge to the sewerage system, then the Plant & Collection Systems
Director may assign a REC to the user. (AMENDED 3/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
(2) Sewer User Charge: A Sewer Use Charge is hereby imposed upon all users of the
sewer system. The Sewer Use Charge shall have a component for recovering the operation,
maintenance and replacement cost and a portion or all of the debt cost of the sewerage system.
On or before the first Common Council meeting in October, of every year the Plant & Collection
Systems Director shall compute the Sewer Use Charge. The operation, maintenance and
replacement portion of the Sewer Use Charge shall be computed by allocating the proposed net
yearly operation, maintenance and replacement budget to the appropriate use factors. The cost
per use factor shall be divided by the City in conjunction with the use factor to determine the unit
cost ($/1000 gallons $/#), per use factor. The flow use factor will be determined by the City in
conjunction with the Water Utility. The BOD, Total Suspended Solids, and Phosphorus use
factors will be determined from the concentration assigned to Domestic Wastewater plus
surcharge user data. These use factors and the Infiltration/Inflow use factor will be determined
by the Plant & Collection Systems Director, considering actual data for the previous 12 month
period from the Wastewater Treatment Facility and surcharge user data. The residential water
consumption for sprinkling as determined by the Water Utility and any water credit meters for
25-10
any refrigeration, air conditioning system or industrial cooling water not entering the sewer
system shall not be used in computing the Sewer Use Charge. Users with domestic wastewater
connected to the sewer system who derive all or part of their water discharged to the sewer
system from other sources than the Water Utility and who do not have these other water sources
metered will be charged for operation, maintenance and replacement costs based upon their
assigned number of residential equivalent connections. The flow per residential equivalent
connection will be computed by the Water Utility or the Plant & Collection Systems Director on
or before the first Common Council meeting in October of every year and shall equal the water
used by residential customers minus sprinkling credits divided by the number of residential water
customers. (AMENDED 3/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
(3) Annual Connection Charge: (a) A weighted meter charge is hereby imposed upon
each user connection to the collection system including nondomestic and industrial waste
dischargers. The charge covers the portion of the flow use factor costs associated with
infiltration/inflow for the operation, maintenance, and replacement and capital costs. The
weighted meter charge also recovers cost associated with customer costs. The weighted meter
charge shall be payable as herein provided. Extraterritorial users who have no water meter shall
be charged based upon the weighted meter charge of a 5/8" meter. (REPEALED AND
RECREATED 2/14/95--ORDINANCE NO. E-282
(b) On or before the first Common Council meeting in October of every year the City
shall compute the number of fixed users to the sewerage system. At the same time the City shall
compute the average percentage of infiltration/inflow (I/I) to the system for the previous 12
months. The cost assigned to the flow use factor for the operation, maintenance and replacement
budget shall be multiplied by percentage of system I/I. The costs assigned to the flow use factor
for the WWTF Capital shall be added thereto. The fixed user for the I/I related to operation,
maintenance and debt retirement and replacement costs will be computed by dividing the
appropriate fixed user cost by the total number of fixed users. (REPEALED AND
RECREATED 2/14/95--ORDINANCE NO. E-282)
(c) The weighted meter charge shall be calculated as follows:
(1) A count of all meters by size is multiplied by weighting and the sum of the results is then
divided into the total connection cost borne by user costs.
(2) The weighting factor adopted by the Common Council shall be known as the PSC weighting
factor and is as follows:
Water Meter Size PSC Weight Factor
5/8" 1.00
3/4" 1.00
1" 2.50
1 ¼" 3.70
1 ½" 5.00
2" 8.00
2 ½" 12.50
3" 15.00
4" 25.00
6" 50.00
8" 80.00
25-11
10" 120.00
12" 160.00
(SECTION (3)(c) CREATED 2/14/95--ORDINANCE NO. E-282)
(4) Industrial and Commercial Charges for Other Than Domestic Wastewater: (a)
Charges for Wastewater other than Domestic Wastewater shall be based on Flow, BOD,
Suspended Solids, Phosphorus, and such other constituents which affect the cost of the collection
and treatment. All persons discharging wastes into the Sewerage System are subject to a
surcharge, in addition to any other wastewater service charge, if their wastewater has a
concentration greater than Domestic Wastewater concentrations. The volume of flow used for
computing waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption, or the actual volume of
waste as determined by a sampling and metering manhole or a discharge monitoring station. The
amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City in removing BOD, Suspended
Solids, Phosphorus, Nitrogen and other pertinent constituents. The surcharge shall be computed
on the basis of Models No. 2 contained on page 5270 of the Federal Register, Volume 39, No.
29, February 11, 1974.
Surcharge = (B (B) + S (S) + P (P) + N (N) ) V
B = O&M costs for treatment of a unit of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
B = Concentration of BOD from a user above the base level
V = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time
S, S, P, P, N, N = Same definition as above for the parameters suspended solids, phosphorus and
nitrogen
(5) Ready-to-Serve Charge: The owner of each premise to which sewer service has been
made available by the City but not connected to the Sewerage System for sewer service shall pay
for the availability thereof a "ready-to-serve charge" provided by Section 25.06 (3). Any "readyto-
serve charge" becoming effective during any year shall be charged on a pro rated basis for that
year in which such charge becomes effective. This charge shall begin from date of notice by the
City that the facility is ready to use. By Section 25.05 (2)(a) of this ordinance connection shall
be made to the Public Sewer within 12 months.
(6) Septage Charge: Charges for septage discharges shall be based on Flow, BOD, TSS,
P, and such other constituents which affect the cost of treatment and disposal. The volume of
flow used for computing the septage charge will be the volume of septage discharged. All
persons discharging septage which has concentrations greater than Domestic Wastewater, as
defined in section 25.04 (10) of this chapter, shall be subject to a surcharge. The amount of the
surcharge shall reflect the costs incurred by the City for removing BOD, TSS, P. and other
pertinent constituents. The surcharge shall be computed in the same manner as described in
section 25.06 (4) of this chapter.
The following waste strength parameters shall serve as the basis for computing the
surcharge to be applied unless the septage discharge is sampled and analyzed:
25-12
Septic Tank Holding Tank
BOD 5,000 mg/l 350 mg/l
TSS 11,000 mg/l 500 mg/l
P 150 mg/l 15 mg/l
All costs associated with administrating the discharge of septage to the WTF, sample
collection, laboratory analysis, and billing will be paid for by the septage hauler.
On or before the first Common Council meeting in October of every year, the Plant &
Collection Systems Director shall, in conjunction with determining sewer service charges,
determine the septage charge and related fees. (AMENDED 8/13/91--ORDINANCE NO. E-
182; AMENDED 3/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
(7) Reserve Capacity Assessment: (a) A reserve capacity assessment will be collected by
the City to all new connections to the sewerage system. This charge shall be collected prior to
receiving a building permit or plumbing permit. A reserve capacity assessment will not be
collected from existing users of the sewer system who had previously shared a common service
lateral. (AMENDED 3/11/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
(b) The reserve capacity assessment shall recover the reserve capacity costs of the sewage
system from new sewer utility customers, and from existing customers whose change of use
increases the volume and/or loadings of their sewerage. The amount of the charge shall equal
the assigned residential equivalent connection (REC) as defined in Section 25.04 and multiplied
by the rate as determined in Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code, after January 1, 1997 said rate to
be increased annually by an amount as determined in Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code.
(AMENDED 3/11/97-- ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
New extraterritorial customers of the sewer utility, and existing extraterritorial customers
whose change of use increases the volume and/or loadings of their sewerage, shall pay a reserve
capacity assessment charge as determined in Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code, increasing by an
amount as determined in Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code. (SECTION 25.06 (7)(b)
AMENDED 4/9/91--ORDINANCE NO. E-175; AMENDED 5/14/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-
327)
(c) The City shall review the appropriateness of the reserve capacity charge every year.
The City may terminate or limit any future increases to the reserve capacity charge at its
discretion.
(d) In the event there is an RCA overestimation at the time the building permit is issued,
the City will reimburse the permit holder only once, at their request, within one year of
occupancy. (CREATED 3/11/97-- ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
(8) Special Rates: It is understood that the approving authority may at any time hereafter,
set special rates for any large commercial service, industrial use, extraterritorial areas, contract
users, or any other unique user that does not readily fit into other categories of users. The
operation, maintenance, and replacement components of such special rates shall be proportionate
to the rates paid by other users and shall be in compliance with the requirements of Wisconsin
Administrative Code NR 162.11. (AMENDED 8/13/91--ORDINANCE NO. E-182)
(9) Extraterritorial Service: 1) Intent. It is the intent of the City of Hartford, that, upon
25-13
request, municipal sewer service shall be provided to any existing singular or collective
wastewater generator(s) within approved sanitary sewer service areas and including
unincorporated areas in the vicinity of the City based on certain scenarios, parameters and
elements.
2) City Sphere, Exurbia and Suburbia Areas. There are widely differing scenarios
regarding sewer service and, therefore, different approaches to the provision of sanitary sewer
are appropriate in different situations. Three development tiers are described below and
identified specifically on an extraterritorial sewer map for guiding the provisions of this policy.
a) City Sphere. Certain already-developed areas contiguous or proximate to City Boundaries
are City-Like, therefore one's perception of the City itself is affected by the appearance of
these areas and the extent to which City amenities and services are available. Other vacant
but proximate areas are easily serviced by City public works. Given State annexation laws
which assume that cities will eventually annex nearby lands from surrounding towns, the
City clearly intends to retain the option in these "City Sphere" areas to foster annexation, or
not, as determined in each instance by the Common Council. These areas are generally
within one-half mile of the City boundaries, often encompass lands abutting the City Limits,
and are referred to herein as the "City Sphere."
b) Exurbia. Certain already-developed and vacant areas are clearly separated from City
boundaries by extensive agricultural or dormant tracts. These areas are sufficiently distant
from the City that they are perceived as not being in the City Sphere, are generally distant
from City Limits, and are referred to herein as the "City Exurbia."
c) Suburbia. Certain areas between the City Sphere and City Exurbia are developed to varying
degrees, and may have been developed or are developable primarily because of the City's
proximity. These areas are characterized as being more difficult to service with sewer and
other City services than the City Sphere; yet they are sufficiently proximate to eventual City
growth that it is expected that these lands will be part of the City Sphere within 10 to 25
years. This area will be referred herein as the "City Suburbia."
3) Provision of sewer in City Sphere. a) Annexation Required. In the City Sphere, sewer
service has historically been associated with annexation, and the City will continue to require
that annexation precede sewer service, except as detailed further in subparagraph 3, e) or where
the Common Council determines that annexation of a particular area is not in the City's best
interest. Subject to Common Council review, City staff is directed to assist property owners
desiring annexation, to assure that State Law and municipal code provisions are met. Because
sound planning requires that many considerations go into good boundary and sewer service
configurations, within the parameters of Law, staff assistance in configuring annexations which
meet the overall needs of the petitioner(s) and the City (as interpreted by the Common Council)
is to be provided.
b) Property-owner organization. Because Sanitary Districts can ultimately present
administrative difficulties to the City if later wholly or partially annexed, the City
discourages their formation in City Sphere areas, preferring where appropriate the
establishment of Town Utility Districts.
c) Compensatory cost reductions. In areas where annexation precedes sewer service, City staff
is directed to actively seek cost reductions where possible for the annexing property owners,
25-14
to compensate for other increased costs to them which are sometimes associated with
annexation. Grant applications in the City's name will actively be pursued where practical,
and the City will otherwise encourage development within the context of existing policy.
d) Construction and Operation of Facilities. Unless there are unusual circumstances determined
by the City Council, the City will construct, operate, and maintain the utilities extended to
any City Sphere property.
e) Property Legally Unable to Annex. Any property which is legally incapable of being
annexed to the City at the time of a request for services shall sign an annexation agreement
prior to receiving service. The agreement shall run with the land and provide for annexation
of the land as soon as it is legally possible. The agreement shall be executed by the property
owner and filed with the City Clerk along with an appropriate recording fee.
f) Charges for Services. The charges for operation and maintenance and capital costs for
properties served within the City Sphere shall be as follows:
i) Capital Costs. The capital costs for each property owner not
annexing to the City will be determined by the Common Council,
consistent with Section 25.06 of this Ordinance. The Common Council
shall determine whether the capital costs shall be paid at the time
service is received by the property or whether the charge shall be placed
on a payment plan.
ii) Operations and Maintenance Costs. The City shall charge for
the operation and maintenance costs of the Sewer Utility based upon the
Sewer Utility Ordinance. The operation and maintenance charges shall
not include the City's cost for the local sewer collection system unless
the City owns and maintains the sewers within the areas served, or the
property connects to a local sewer.
iii) Service Charge Surcharge. Properties in the City Sphere
shall be charged at extraterritorial rates as established within this
ordinance.
4) Provision of sewer in Exurbia. The City's initial preference will be to provide sewer
service to areas located in Exurbia without annexation to the City. The City may work with
residents of such areas and their Town and District governments to secure available sewer grants
or low interest loans to lessen the costs to those served, provided the grant application and
facilities ownership are determined to be in the best interests of the City.
a) Capital costs. The capital costs for each property owner not annexing to the City and/or not
signing an annexation agreement with the City will be determined by the Common Council
consistent with Section 25.06 of this Ordinance. The City Council shall determine whether
the capital costs shall be paid at the time service is received by the property or whether the
charge shall be allowed to be paid on a payment plan.
b) Construction and operation of facilities. Unless there are unusual circumstances determined
by the City Council, the City will construct, operate, and maintain the utilities extended to
any City Sphere property.
25-15
c) Operation and maintenance costs. The City shall charge for the operation and maintenance
costs of the sewer utility based on the Sewer Utility Ordinance.
d) Service charge surcharge. Properties in the Exurbia area shall be charged the extraterritorial
rates as established within this ordinance.
5) Provision of sewer in Suburbia. In general, the City's approach to development and/or
provision of sewer in City Suburbia lies in between its policies for the City Sphere and Exurbia.
The City's position regarding the conditions of providing sewer with or without annexation must
be determined on a case-by-case basis. Following the determination by the Common Council of
whether the land will be classified City Sphere or Exurbia, the provision of sewer services will
proceed under either of the two defined classifications. Areas within the City Growth Area as
defined in the City of Hartford and Town of Hartford Vision 2020 Intergovernmental
Agreement, December 1999, will be classified City Sphere. (SECTION 25.06 (9) REPEALED
AND RECREATED 6/11/90--ORDINANCE NO. E-154; AMENDED 2/27/01-- ORDINANCE
NO. E-450)
6) Extraterritorial sewer recipients are subject to the terms and conditions of this
ordinance. Extraterritorial rates for municipally owned systems shall, in the absence of any other
arrangement, be based on the same methodology for determining the municipal sewer rates and
shall be in compliance with the requirements of Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 162.11.
The capital related portion of such rates shall be subjected to a 25% surcharge. (CREATED
8/13/91--ORDINANCE NO. E-182)
(10) Tax Incremental District Charge. 1) A tax incremental district charge is hereby
imposed upon the City for all costs of the sewage system (including debt service coverage ratio
requirements imposed by any bond resolution) which are allocable to improvements undertaken
within a tax incremental district of the City. On or before the first Common Council meeting in
October of every year the Plant & Collection System Director shall compute the charge. The
charge shall be computed by calculating an amount equal to the annual debt service on the tax
incremental district share of all outstanding sewer utility borrowings (including debt service
coverage ratio requirements imposed by any bond resolution).
2) The tax incremental district charge shall be billed to the City on October 1st of each
year for all obligations due during the subsequent year. The payment shall be due within ninety
days of billing. (SECTION (10) CREATED 12/9/97--ORDINANCE NO. E-392)
25.07 ANNUAL BUDGET AND METHOD OF PAYMENT OF CHARGES. (1)
Annually before the first Common Council meeting in October the City Administrator shall
prepare a budget for the following fiscal year which shall be separated into sections, the first for
operation and maintenance and the second for debt service. The budget shall then be further
divided into infiltration and inflow related costs and use related costs.
(2) Revenues for the operation and maintenance budget shall include any projected yearend
balance (excluding replacement funds), operating fund investment income, contract
revenues, permit fees, special rates, and sewer user charges.

the special assessment funds, projected Residential Equivalency Charges, connection charges,
sinking fund interest income, and sewer user charges. (AMENDED 8/13/91--ORDINANCE
NO. E-182)
(7) Expenditures for the debt service budget shall include principal, interest, premiums,
paying agency fees and other expenses related to debt.
(8) A reserve account of 125% of the projected debt service budget shall be maintained to
abate the yearly tax levy required by the bond ordinances. Thereafter, the yearly debt costs shall
be budgeted as required.
(9) Sewer Service charges may be billed monthly and shall be payable at the City
Treasurer's office or at any other officially designated location. Statements for such charges and
assessments levied and assessed in accordance with this Ordinance shall become due and
payable within 20 days from and after the date of the statement. In the event that any such
statement or statements are not paid within the 20 days of issuance, a charge of 1.5% will be
added to the current month billing charge. This charge is applicable to all customers.
(AMENDED 2/14/95--ORDINANCE NO. E-282)
(10) Billing: The property owner is held responsible for all sewer bills on premises that
he owns. All sewer bills and notices of any nature, relative to the sewer service, will be
addressed to the owner and/or occupant and delivered to the addressee by first class mail.
(11) Failure to Receive Bill No Penalty Exemption: Every reasonable care will be
exercised in the proper delivery of sewer bills. Failure to receive a sewer bill, however, shall not
relieve any person of the responsibility for payment of sewer rates within the prescribed period,
nor exempt any person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment thereof.
(12) Delinquent Bills: The Sewer Utility willattempt to collect delinquent sewer bills, and
if unsuccessful, the balance where possible will be placed on the tax rolls as a lien on the
property pursuant to State Statute 66.60 (16) for any unpaid amount. Interest shall accrue at the
rate of 1.5% per month on the unpaid balance. (AMENDED 4/9/91--ORDINANCE NO. E-175)

(5) Transfer of a Permit: Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold
to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation.
(6) Revocation of Permit: Any user who violates any of the conditions of his permit
contractual agreement, or this Ordinance; or of applicable State and Federal regulations, is
subject to having his permit revoked.
(7) Discharge Monitoring Agreement: The City may require an industry or any high
volume or high strength waste discharger to enter in to a Discharge Monitoring Agreement if in
the judgment of the City such an agreement is necessary to properly evaluate the users discharge
to the Sewerage System and/or to obtain adequate information to properly assess a surcharge. In
the absence of a Discharge Monitoring Agreement, the City may assign a surcharge to a user
which in the City's judgment is appropriate of the users discharge. The City may assess a
surcharge to a user even though the City does not require the user to enter into a Discharge
Monitoring Agreement. A sample of a Discharge Monitoring Agreement is on file with the City.
25.16 ADMISSION TO PROPERTY. The City, its agents and employees shall be
permitted to gain access to such properties as may be necessary for the purpose of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with provisions of this
Ordinance, pursuant to Section 66.122 through 66.125 of the Wisconsin Statutes.
25.17 CONFIDENTIALITY OF CRITICAL INFORMATION. When requested by
the user furnishing a report or permit application or questionnaire, the portions of the report, or
other document, which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for use by the City or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report.
25.18 VIOLATIONS. (1) Any person who fails to comply with any of the provisions of
this Ordinance or with an order of the City issued in pursuance of this Ordinance, or shall tamper
with metering or sampling, shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned
by such violation including reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation and upon
conviction of any violation of this Ordinance, shall be fined an amount within a range as shown
in Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code per violation, plus damages. Each day a condition is
allowed to exist which is contrary to all or any part of this Ordinance shall constitute a new
violation. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises delinquent under the provisions of
this Ordinance shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating charges due and penalties for
violations. (AMENDED 6/11/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-335)
(2) If any user shall discharge a waste or wastewater including septage that is inhibiting to
the sewer system or wastewater treatment facility said user shall pay a penalty in an amount as
25-24
shown in Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code per violation upon conviction. Each day a violation
occurs shall constitute a separate violation. Said penalty shall be added to the monthly or
quarterly billing statement, if not paid within 30 days of conviction or such other time as set by
the court. (AMENDED 6/11/96-- ORDINANCE NO. E-335)
(3) In addition to the Court proceedings and penalties described in the foregoing
sections of this Ordinance, whenever a person violates any provision of this Ordinance or fails to
comply with any order of the City, the City may order that an action be commenced on behalf of
the City in the Circuit Court for Washington County for the purpose of obtaining an injunction
restraining the person violating the Ordinance or failing to comply with the Order, from making
any further discharges into the Sewer System of the City.
(4) Any licensed disposer discharging to the wastewater treatment facility or to a public
sewer, found to be violating a provision of this ordinance or of any conditions of the approval for
septage disposal, may have their approval immediately revoked. This revocation shall be done in
writing and state the reason for revoking the septage disposal approval.
25.19 RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT CONNECTION TABLE AND UNMETERED
WASTEWATER FLOW ASSIGNMENTS. For unmetered users of the sewerage system the
following table shall be used to determine the Residential Equivalent Connection (REC) or
estimated gallons of wastewater discharged to the sewerage system except as provided for in
Section 25.13.
RESIDENTIAL REC
Condominium 1.0
Single family home 1.0
Duplex 2.0
Multiple Family (2 bedrooms) 1.0/unit
Multiple Family (1 bedroom or less) 0.75/unit
For unmetered commercial and industrial users of the sewerage system their wastewater
flow shall be determined from the following table unless the Plant & Collection Systems
Director determines that the information in the tables does not accurately reflect the users
wastewater discharge to the sewerage system in which case the Plant & Collection Systems
Director will assign a wastewater flow to the user. The REC may be determined by dividing the
wastewater flow obtained from the table by the flow of the average residential user. The
minimum REC for any account shall not be less than 1.00 REC. Upon completion of the REC
computations all REC's will be rounded to the nearest 0.25 REC. (AMENDED 3/11/97--
ORDINANCE NO. E-357)
25.20 SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this ordinance are severable. If a section,
subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase shall be determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
this ordinance.

payment of personal property taxes, obtain a license therefor. (AMENDED 5/26/98--
ORDINANCE NO. E-401)
(2) Fees. Such owner shall pay to the City Treasurer annually a sum as determined in
Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code for each neutered male dog or cat and spayed female dog or
cat (a veterinarian's certificate must be presented for each neutered or spayed dog or cat), for
each unneutered/ unspayed dog or cat, and for each kennel as defined in Section 174.06 of the

(AMENDED 5/26/98--ORDINANCE NO. E-401)
(4) State Regulations. The provisions of Chapter 174 of the Wisconsin Statutes pertaining
to licensing of dogs are made a part of this section by reference thereto.

Common Council as provided in Section 8.10 of the Municipal Code. Each owner of any such
animal is required to confine it within the limits of his/her premises except when it is attended by
some person, and in such cases it shall be fastened securely by a suitable leash not more than 10
feet in length. For the purposes of this section, the phrase "running at large" embraces all places

42 of the Municipal Code, within 7 days after its confinement, such dog or cat shall be disposed
26-2
of humanely. (AMENDED 6/11/96--ORDINANCE NO. E-335)
26.04 KEEPING OF VICIOUS DOGS REGULATED. (1) DEFINITIONS. The
terms used in this section are defined as follows:
(a) Vicious Dog. 1. Any dog with a propensity, tendency or disposition to attack, cause injury
or otherwise endanger the safety of human beings or other domestic animals as evidenced by its
habitual or repeated chasing or snapping, or barking and/or snarling in a threatening manner.
2. Any dog which attacks a human being, another domestic animal, or livestock without
provocation.
3. Any dog owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of dog-fighting, or any
dog trained for dog-fighting.
(2) REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS. (a) Leash and Muzzle. No person
owning, harboring or having the care of a vicious dog may suffer or permit such dog to go
outside its kennel or pen unless the dog is securely leashed with a leash no longer than 4 feet in
length. No person may permit a vicious dog to be kept on a chain, rope or other type of leash
outside its kennel or pen unless a person is in physical control of the leash. The dog may not be
leashed to inanimate objects such as trees, posts and buildings. A vicious dog on a leash outside
the dog's kennel shall be muzzled by a muzzling device sufficient to prevent the dog from biting
persons or other animals. A vicious dog shall not be required to be muzzled when shown either
in a sanctioned American Kennel Club show or upon prior approval of the Police Chief.
(a) Confinement. All vicious dogs shall be securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed
and locked pen or kennel, except when leashed and muzzled as provided in par. (a) above.
The pen, kennel or structure shall have secure sides and a secure top attached to all sides. A
structure used to confine the dog is within the structure. The structure shall have a secure
bottom or floor attached to the sides of the pen, or the sides odes of the pen must be
embedded in the ground no less than 2 feet. All structures erected to house vicious dogs
shall comply with all zoning and building regulations of the City. All structures shall be
adequately lighted and ventilated and kept in a clean and sanitary condition.
(b) Confinement Indoors. No vicious dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a
house or structure that would allow the dog to exit the building on its volition. No vicious
dog may be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open or when screen
windows or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the dog from exiting the structure.
(c) Prohibited in Multiple Dwellings. No vicious dog may be kept within any portion of any
multiple dwelling.
(d) Signs. All owners, keepers or harborers of vicious dogs shall, within 15 days of the
effective date of this section, display in a prominent place on their premises a sign easily
readable by the public using the words "Beware of Dog." A similar sign is required to be
posed on the kennel or pen of the dog.
(e) Insurance. All owners, keepers or harborers of vicious dogs shall, within 30 days of the
effective date of this section, provide proof to the Police Chief of public liability insurance
in a single incident amount of $50,000 for bodily injury to or death of any person or for the
damage to property owned by any person which may result from the ownership, keeping or
26-3
maintenance of vicious dogs. The insurance policy shall provide that no cancellation of the
policy will be made unless a 10-day written notice is first given to the Police Chief. The
owner or custodian of the dog shall produce evidence of the required insurance upon request
of a law enforcement officer. This paragraph does not apply to dogs kept by law
enforcement agencies.
(3) VICIOUS DOG DETERMINATION. The Police Chief, or his designee, shall
investigate every dog complaint and make a determination as to whether or not such dog is
"vicious," as defined in sub. (1) above. In the event the Police Chief or his designee makes a
determination that a dog is "vicious," he shall so inform the owner, keeper or harborer of such
dog and provide such person with a copy of this section.
(4) APPEAL OF VICIOUS DOG DETERMINATION. Any person aggrieved by the
determination of the Police Chief or his designee, as provided in sub. (3) above, may appeal such
determination, to a court of competent jurisdiction.
(5) DISPOSITION OF VICIOUS DOGS. Any vicious dog which attacks a human being,
livestock, or domestic animal may be ordered destroyed by a police officer or humane officer
when, in the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the dog represents a continuing threat
of serious harm to human beings, livestock, or domestic animals.
(6) PENALTY. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall, upon
conviction, be subject to the payment of a forfeiture in an amount within a range as shown in
Chapter 42 of the Municipal Code. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day
on which a violation of this section occurs or continues. (AMENDED 6/11/96--ORDINANCE
NO. E-335)
(7) EXEMPTION. The provisions of this ordinance regarding dangerous and vicious
dogs shall not apply to animals owned by law enforcement agencies and used for law
enforcement purposes.
(8) SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Ordinance is found to be unconstitutional
but shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining sections of this Ordinance. (SECTION
26.04 REPEALED AND RECREATED 10/11/94--ORDINANCE NO. E-275)
26.05 INFECTED DOGS; HYDROPHOBIA, RABIES. (1) Any person may kill a
dog which he believes to be infected with the disease known as hydrophobia or rabies. Proof
that the appearance or conduct of the dog was such as would give an ordinarily prudent person to
believe the dog to have been infected with the disease, shall be sufficient basis for the belief that
the dog was in such diseased condition, and shall constitute an absolute defense to any action for
damages or otherwise for the killing of the dog.
(2) Any person who shall suspect that any dog in the City is infected with rabies or
hydrophobia, shall report his suspicion to the police or health authorities, describing the dog and
giving the name of the owner, if known; and if, upon examination by the health authorities, the
dog shall prove in fact to be infected with said disease, the dog may be killed and the person
making the report shall be entitled to receive the sum of $5 from any unappropriated monies in
the treasury.
(3) When the health authorities shall have determined that a dog found in the City is
infected with rabies or hydrophobia, the Mayor may, upon written advice of the health
26-4
authorities that the public safety and general welfare require it, order by proclamation, that all
dogs be muzzled when off the premises of the owner, and that all unmuzzled dogs found off the
premises of the owner be immediately seized and impounded, and may further order that, after
the proclamation has been published 48 hours, either by posting or printing in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City, all dogs found off the premises of the owner unmuzzled shall be
seized, impounded and killed, except that an officer may immediately kill any unmuzzled dog, if
with reasonable effort it cannot be seized and impounded. All dogs seized and impounded
during the first 48 hours after the publishing of any such proclamation shall, if claimed within
four days, be returned to the owner thereof without any impounding charge or cost, if not
infected with hydrophobia or rabies; but after four days such dogs may be killed.
(4) No person shall knowingly harbor or keep any dog infected with hydrophobia or
rabies, or any dog known to have been bitten by a dog known to have been infected with
hydrophobia or rabies, or shall fail to report to the police or health authorities the existence of
any dog which he knows to be infected with hydrophobia or rabies.
26.06 BARKING DOGS. It shall be unlawful for any person within the City to own,
harbor or keep any dog that habitually barks or howls to the annoyance of any person. This
paragraph shall not apply to any veterinarian offices or boarding kennels. (REPEALED AND
RECREATED 11/26/02—ORDINANCE NO. E-506)
26.07 ANIMALS: AT LARGE: SETTING AT LARGE: LITTERING. It shall be
unlawful for the owner of any animal to permit fecal matter which is deposited by such animal
while off of its own premises to remain on any street, alley, sidewalk, lawn, field or any public
property, and it shall be solely the responsibility of the owner of said animal to immediately after
deposit remove all fecal matter by shovel, scoop or like instrument and deposit said fecal matter
in a manner approved by state or other local regulations.
26.08 KEEPING OF WILD AND EXOTIC ANIMALS REGULATED. (1)
Keeping Wild and Exotic Animals Prohibited. No person shall keep, maintain or have in such
person’s possession or under such person’s control any poisonous reptile, dangerous or wild
animal or insect, including, but not limited to, poisonous insects and arachnids, all venomous
snakes, constrictor snakes, any snake exceeding four (4) feet in length, non-human primates,
bears, crocodiles, alligators, monitor lizards, bats, wild and domestic animal hybrids such as
coyote/dog, coyotes, elephants, gamecocks and other fighting birds, hippopotami, hyenas,
jaguars, leopards, lions, lynx, pumas, cougars, mountain lions, panthers, ocelots, tigers, or other
wild feline species, wolves, and prairie dogs.
(a) Exceptions. The prohibitions set forth in subsection (1) shall not apply to: residents
of the City who possessed one or more of the prohibited species prior to the effective date of this
ordinance and who register same with the office of the City Clerk within 60 days of the effective
date; licensed veterinary clinics; licensed animal rehabilitation homes; zoological gardens; public
or private educational institutions; agricultural fairs; shows or projects of the 4-H Clubs; a
display for judging purposes; circuses and professional animal acts or other shows requiring a

2. All animals and animal quarters are kept in a clean and sanitary condition and so maintained
as to eliminate objectionable odors.
3. Animals are maintained in quarters so constructed as to prevent their escape.
26-5

CHAPTER 29
PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE
29.00 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE
29.01 - INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE AND INTENT
The initial building construction or development in a community is usually accomplished after a
great deal of planning, designing, and implementation. The time and attention to detail given to
the initial construction is, often, the last concentrated effort regarding the total visual affect of the
building and building lot or site. While most property owners establish a periodic maintenance
program to keep their property in a visually pleasing and physically safe and sanitary condition,
many properties are unkept and are left to visual or physical decay. Due, primarily, to this
circumstance, it has been determined that there is a need to set forth guidelines as well as
regulations to ensure the continuing maintenance of property within the City.
It is the intent and purpose of this section of the Hartford Municipal Code to encourage, establish
minimum standards for, and provide for the enforcement of a minimum level of care and
maintenance to buildings and properties throughout the City. It is not the intent of this ordinance
to discourage or inhibit owners of older residences from upgrading such residences over an
extended period.
29.02 - SCOPE
This ordinance shall apply uniformly to the maintenance and use of all premises within the City
of Hartford and the owners, occupants, and operators thereof.
29.03 - TITLE
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Property Maintenance Code of the City of
Hartford, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance".

the neighborhood with similar uses. More specifically, it is every property owner and
occupant's responsibility to:
1) Keep any building(s) and building-related equipment located on the property in good, safe

34.26 INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE. A Grantee is not responsible for failure to

action, or other conditions beyond its control including the lack of material or parts. Upon
interruption of service, except for acts of God or with express prior permission of the City, the
following shall apply:
1) A Grantee shall promptly and satisfactorily investigate any complaints as to the quality
of its signal or services and make such adjustments as may be required to correct situations
disclosed by such investigations 7 days a week. In the event that a Grantee is unable to restore
any loss of service within 72 hours, the Grantee shall, upon request of a subscriber, credit 1/30th
of the subscriber's monthly service charge to each affected subscriber for each 24-hour period
that the subscriber is without service following report of the loss of service to the Grantee.
2) Whenever it is necessary to interrupt service over the cable system for the purpose of
maintenance, alteration or repair, a Grantee shall do so at such times as will cause the least

notice may be given over the cable system. If the Grantee fails to resume service within 72

In instances wherein the Grantee is not required to provide service pursuant to this
paragraph, the Grantee and subscriber may nevertheless contract to have service provided on
terms and conditions agreeable to both the subscriber and Grantee.
34.28 GRANTEE RULES. The Grantee may promulgate such rules, regulations, terms
and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
the Grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under a Franchise and to assure
uninterrupted service to all its subscribers. However, such rules, regulations, terms and
conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the laws of the State.
34.29 WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS. By adoption of this chapter, the City expressly
34-10
waives all objections it has or may have to the legal rights of the Grantee to attach its cables,
equipment and transmission lines to the poles of the City, pursuant to an agreement or to the
poles of the public utilities and the authority of such public utilities to grant such right to the
Grantee.
34.30 GRANTEE WITHOUT RECOURSE. Grantee shall have no recourse
whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost or expense, or damage arising out of any

investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the City to grant the Franchise.

enter into the Franchise by any understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or
written, by or on behalf of the City or by any other third person concerning any term or condition
of the Franchise not expressed herein. Grantee further acknowledges by acceptance of the
Franchise that it has carefully read the terms and conditions thereof, and is willing to and does
accept all the risks of the meeting of such terms and conditions and agrees that in the event of
any ambiguity therein or in the event of any dispute over the meaning thereof the same shall be
construed strictly against the Grantee and in favor of the City.

possession or may come into his or her possession or such other information as may have a
bearing upon the determination of gross receipts. On the basis of this estimate the Treasurer
shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the City, adding to the sum thus
arrived at a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) thereof. Such determination may be made for
each quarterly period for which no return is filed. Such penalty shall be due upon written notice
to the business entity or person owing the tax and shall not be in lieu of the tax due hereunder.

first class mail to the last-known address of the owner as identified by the records of the City
Assessor. The CNP Notice shall contain the following information:
(1) Street address, parcel number or a legal description sufficient to identify the
premises.
(2) A concise statement, including a description of the relevant activities supporting the
determination that the premises is a chronic nuisance premises.
41-16
(3) A statement that the owner shall immediately notify the authorized official of any
change in address to ensure receipt of future notices.
(4) A statement that the actual costs of future enforcement may be assessed as a special
charge against the premises.
(5) A statement that the owner shall, within ten (10) days of the date the CNP Notice is

written action plan to abate the nuisance, or notify the official in writing of the intention to
appeal.
(6) A statement that the premises owner shall at all times comply with the fair housing
requirements contained in Chapter 17, Article XIII, of the Hartford Municipal Code when

Section 42.02(1) of the Hartford Municipal Code.
B. In reaching a determination that a premises is a chronic nuisance premises, activities
that were reported to the Police or other City departments by the premises owner or on-site
premises manager shall not be included as nuisance activities.
(1) Wisconsin §968.075, broadly defines "domestic abuse". Therefore, in reaching a
determination that a premises is a chronic nuisance premises, activities that are "domestic
abuse" incidents pursuant to Wisconsin §968.075, shall not be included as nuisance activities
unless the incidents have been reviewed by the Chief of Police and the Office of the City
Attorney and a determination is made that, based upon the specific facts of each incident, the
activities should be deemed nuisance activities. In determining whether to include such
activities, the Chief of Police and Office of the City Attorney shall consider the strong public
policy in favor of domestic victims reporting alleged abuses, and this ordinance shall not
operate to discourage such reports.
(2) If the owner responds to the CNP Notice with a written action plan to abate the
nuisance, the authorized official may accept, reject or work with the owner to modify the action
plan. The plan is acceptable if it can reasonably be expected to result in abatement of the
nuisance activities described in the CNP Notice within fifteen (15) calendar days of the mailing
of the CNP Notice in Section 3.)A.)5.).
(3) Premises owners shall be counseled regarding nuisance abatement methods and
strategies and shall be encouraged to submit a comprehensive nuisance abatement action plan
that considers alternatives to eviction in situations where eviction is not the sole remedy
available to abate the nuisance activity.
(4) If the premises owner meets with the authorized official and presents an acceptable
abatement action plan and implements the terms of the action plan, the authorized official will
delay further enforcement of this ordinance, including cost recovery.
(5) If the premises owner ceases to cooperate with the efforts to abate the nuisance
activities, the authorized official may reinstitute enforcement of this ordinance and the
premises owner may be sent a change in status letter. This letter will document the authorized
official’s efforts to contact and/or obtain cooperation of the owner.
41-17
C. Whenever the authorized official determines that any of the following have occurred:
(1) A premises owner has failed to respond to the CNP Notice;
(2) Enforcement action for an additional nuisance activity has occurred at a premises for
which notice has been issued pursuant to this ordinance and this enforcement action has
occurred not less than fifteen (15) days after the CNP Notice has been issued in accordance
with Section 3.)A.)5.); or
(3) An action plan submitted has not been completed;
then the authorized official may calculate the actual costs of enforcement to abate this and any
subsequent nuisance activities and may refer such cost to the City Finance Department so that
the cost may be billed to the premises owner. The authorized official shall provide written
notice to the premises owner of the decision to refer the cost of enforcement to the City
Finance Department. The notice shall contain:
a. The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the premises.
b. A statement that the authorized official has referred the cost of enforcement to the
City Finance Department.
c. A statement advising the owner that in addition to any other penalty imposed by this
chapter for the continuance of a chronic nuisance property, the cost of abating a public
nuisance by the city shall be collected as a debt from the owner, and if notice to abate the
nuisance has been given to the owner, such cost shall be assessed against the real estate as
other special taxes.
d. A statement advising the owner each subsequent incident of enforcement action for
nuisance activity shall be deemed a separate violation and costs will continue to be assessed
until the nuisance is abated.
(4) Penalties and Remedies
A. Cost recovery. The authorized official shall keep an accurate account of the cost of
enforcement and shall report it to the City Finance Department. The Finance Director shall
charge any premises owner found to be in violation of this section the costs of enforcement in
full or in part. Such costs shall be billed to the premises owner by invoice sent by regular mail
and must be paid within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. Any unpaid invoice shall be
a lien on such premises and may be assessed and collected as a special charge pursuant to
Wisconsin §66.0627. Pursuant to Section 42.04 FEES, of the Hartford Municipal Code, the
Finance Director shall cause to be added an Administrative Fee for these Special Assessment
Letters of $100.00 to the total cost of enforcement charged to the benefitted premises owner
in the invoice any time the premises is declared a chronic nuisance premises.
B. Suspension of cost recovery. If after the receipt of a billing notice from the Finance
Department, the premises owner develops an acceptable action plan and implements the plan,
the authorized official may suspend further enforcement of this ordinance. The premises
owner is still responsible for any enforcement costs incurred prior to the premises owner’s
submitting an action plan, including the administrative fee. If the premises owner ceases to
cooperate with the efforts to abate the nuisance activities, the authorized official may
reinstitute enforcement of this ordinance after sending the premises owner a change in status
letter.
41-18
C. Forfeiture. A forfeiture action may be commenced for each enforcement action for
nuisance activity occurring after the premises has been declared a chronic nuisance premises.

the Hartford Municipal Code may be issued for each enforcement action.
D. Severability. The terms and provisions of this ordinance are severable. Should any
term or provision of this ordinance be found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,

FORFEITURES, FEES AND CHARGES
42.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSES. All forfeitures, fees, charges and other fixed
sources of revenue paid to the City of Hartford, and to related organizations whose budgets are
reviewed and/or approved by the Common Council, shall be listed in this chapter, except special
assessments and charges, utility and property tax rates set by annual budget and/or the Public
Service Commission, certain recreation program and other fees and charges which change
frequently due to programmatic variation, some time and material charges, and other incidental
fees.
1) This listing is designed to provide citizens, staff and elected officials with a single reference
document for most municipal charges.
2) The intent of this comprehensive listing is to facilitate annual review of forfeitures, fees,
charges and other revenue sources, to assure that, to the extent feasible, users of specific
municipal services continue to bear the cost of materials, operational costs, related outside
charges to the City, staff review time, staff paperwork-related costs, and related indirect
costs. To the extent feasible, reviews shall occur prior to or concurrent with the budgetary
process for adoption of appropriate revisions by the Common Council effective either
January 1 or July 1 of each year.
3) It shall be the policy of the City of Hartford that, to the extent practical, user costs not be
subsidized by property taxes or otherwise shifted to non-related income sources, and that
there be progressive movement toward municipal service users paying 100% of related costs.
Once established, user fees are intended to remain at 100% of costs. Where feasible, cost
analyses shall be prepared on occasion to determine that user fees are neither too low to
recover the cost of service delivery, nor serve as a subsidy for other cost centers.
42.02 BOND SCHEDULE. (1) Standard Penalty. The range for deposit amounts for
municipal ordinance violations is shown following the municipal code chapter, ordinance
number, or offense description. If any offense description does not indicate a specific deposit

(2) Purpose. On November 18, 2009 the Attorney General for the State of Wisconsin
rendered an opinion, identified as OAG-8-09, that a municipal plaintiff is allowed to tax costs

The purpose of this Ordinance is to implement the authority recognized by the Wisconsin
Statutes and the Attorney General.

serve a warrant or commitment order upon a person. The person served with the warrant or
commitment order shall be responsible for the payment of the warrant or commitment order
service fee. The service fee may be collected as a court cost through the court.
(4) Multiple Warrants. The City of Hartford Police Department shall charge a separate fee
for each warrant or commitment order served on a person.
(5) Disposition of Fees. Upon collection by the court, all warrant or commitment order
service fees shall be forwarded by the court to the City Treasurer.
(6) Severability. It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that should any provision
of this Ordinance be declared invalid, illegal, unenforceable, or unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent
provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
42-33
Ordinance. Furthermore, the relevant court of competent jurisdiction is authorized to substitute
for the provision at issue a valid and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision
at issue.
(7) Implementation. All ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent with or
contrary to this Ordinance are hereby repealed. The City Clerk is authorized and directed to take
all action necessary to incorporate this Ordnance into the City Code of Ordinances without
further authorization.
