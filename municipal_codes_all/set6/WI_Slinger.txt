Village of Slinger. For purposes of this subsection, professional fees
shall include any charges incurred by the Village in relation to such
application from the Village Engineer, Village Attorney, or any other
of the Village's professional staff, whether such professional staff is
employed by the Village or independently contracted.
§ 51-16 SLINGER CODE § 51-17
1:44
(4) Professional fees related to work performed by the Village
Engineer or any other staff employed by the Village may include the
costs for hours worked specific to an application received from a
developer. These costs will be documented with the relevant dates
and times to be provided to the developer.
(5) Before charging a developer with professional fees in accordance
with this section, the Village Administrator or Village Treasurer
shall ensure that the work performed does not benefit the Village of
Slinger as a whole. Only those charges that are shown to be of
private benefit to the property owner shall be charged.
B. Developer required to pay chargeback fees. The Village will not accept
applications or requests for review from a developer without first
receiving a deposit for payment of all fees to be incurred related to
work to be performed by the Village Engineer, Village Attorney, or any
other of the Village's professional staff, whether such staff is employed
by the Village or independently contracted, that is not a service
supplied to the Village of Slinger as a whole; and a signed notice and
acknowledgment form regarding the developer's responsibility to pay
fees incurred by the Village. The deposit shall be in the amount of $500
unless a different amount is required by the Village Administrator due
to the circumstances of the development project. In the event such fees
are not paid in a timely manner, the Village will discontinue the review
process for the subject application or request until such time as the fees
are paid in full. The Village may draw funds from the deposit for
payment of such fees, and shall provide a written notice to the
developer of any such use of the deposited funds. No permits, including
but not limited to building permits, occupancy permits, and conditional
use permits, will be issued until all fees are paid. Unused deposit funds
will be returned to the person or entity who made the deposit upon
request following payment of all outstanding fees after final acceptance
of the development as a whole has been granted by the Village.
C. Appeal to Village Board. Upon written request for hearing, the Village
Board shall hold a hearing regarding any contested chargeback fees at
its next scheduled meeting or as soon as feasible. Such hearing shall be
preceded by posted public notice and reasonable notice, via first-class
mail, to the developer. In the event a hearing is requested, no contested
charges shall be due unless and until such hearing has been held and a
decision has been rendered by the Village Board, and the Village Board
approves the charges in whole or in part. If the charges are approved
only in part, only that part of the charges may be charged.

occurs before a successor is selected or qualifies, such records shall be
delivered to and receipted for by the Clerk, on behalf of the successor,
to be delivered to such successor upon the latter's receipt.
A. Although all public records requests should be made to the Village
Clerk, each elected official is the legal custodian of his or her records

A. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the Village Clerk.
The Village Clerk will either respond to the request directly or forward

practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the
requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole
or in part and the reasons therefor. If the Village Clerk or legal
custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a
written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party
making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request
in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 116-6. If a request
is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a
written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the
requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written
request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a
written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written

criminal offense or possible misconduct connected with
employment by an employee prior to the disposition of the

C. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is
not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after
conferring with the Village Attorney, may deny the request in whole or

resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full
access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which
disclosure may be refused include but are not limited to the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which
were necessary and given in order to obtain the information
contained in them.
(2) Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.

prevention.
(5) Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of
Village property, investing of Village funds, or other Village
business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require
nondisclosure.

of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a
substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person
referred to in such history or data.
(7) Communications between legal counsel for the Village and any
officer, agent or employee of the Village, when advice is being
rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in
which the Village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is
likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged
under § 905.03, Wis. Stats.

Chapter 160
ADULT-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning  See Ch. 550.
§ 160-1. Purpose and findings.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of citizens of the Village of Slinger, and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the Village of
Slinger. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the
First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors
of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is
it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
B. Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the Village, and on findings incorporated in the cases
of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of
Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S. 560
(1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); East of the
River Enterprises II v. City of Hudson, 2000 Wisc. App. Lexis 734 (Ct.
App. Aug. 1, 2000); Ben's Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702

(7th Cir. 2003), and on studies in other communities, including but not
limited to Phoenix, Arizona; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota;

and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on Regulation
of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota),
and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Village Board
finds that:
(1) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary and
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled
by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently
no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2) Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher
incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees
of other establishments.
(3) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented business, especially those which provide private
or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sex shows.
(4) Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
(5) Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
(6) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited
to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B, amebiasis,
salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(7) Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by the HIV virus in the United
States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985,
and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
(8) The State of Wisconsin Division of Health indicated that on July 25,
1986, there was 96 cases of AIDS reported in the state, including
54 cases that resulted in death and that a tenfold increase in
reported cases was expected between 1986 and 1991.
§ 160-1 SLINGER CODE § 160-1
1:72
(9) The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases
reported in 1982, and 45,200 through November 1990.
(10) The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases
being reported in 1990.
(11) In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the
United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV
infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous
drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components and
from an infected mother to her newborn.
(12) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
(13) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the
facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those
facilities.
(14) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is
found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons
view adult-oriented films.
(15) Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related
crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where
sexually oriented business are located.
(16) Studies of the relationship between sexually oriented business and
neighborhood property values have found a negative impact on
both residential and commercial property values.
(17) There is an increase in the potential for infiltration by organized
crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct.
(18) The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of
sexually oriented businesses exacerbated the deleterious
secondary effects of such businesses on the community. In fact, the
Supreme Court has gone so far as to assert that "common sense
indicates that any form of nudity coupled with alcohol begets
undesirable behavior." Ben's Bar, 2003 WL 132541, *19 (citations
omitted).
(19) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the
substantial government concerns addressed in the above
subsections.
§ 160-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 160-1
1:73
§ 160-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADULT ARCADE  Any place to which the public is permitted or invited,
wherein coin-operated or slug-operated or electronically, electrically, or
mechanically controlled or still or motion picture machines, projectors, or
other image-producing devices are regularly maintained to show images to
five or fewer persons per machine at any one time, and where the images
so displayed are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis upon
matters exhibiting specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.
ADULT BOOKSTORE or ADULT VIDEO STORE 
(20) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see
that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent
with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as
well as the citizens of the Village. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
(21) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of
such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.
(22) In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is
desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to
such conduct.
(23) The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the
Village of Slinger will be promoted by the enactment of this
chapter.
A commercial establishment that has as a significant or substantial
portion of its stock-in-trade, or derives a significant or substantial

consideration, of any one or more of the following:

purposes that do not involve the offering for sale or rental of material
depicting or describing specified sexual activities or specified
anatomical areas and still be categorized as "adult bookstore" or "adult
video store" so long as one of its principal business purposes is the
offering for sale or rental for consideration the specified materials that
depict or describe specified sexual activities or specified anatomical
areas. A principal business purpose need not be a primary use of an
establishment so long as it is a significant use based upon the visible

being unmanaged or overgrown in ways that adversely affect human
health or safety, or create a nuisance due to their visual appearance. It
is the express intent of this section that it shall be unlawful to allow the
growth of noxious weeds, certain prohibited plants, invasive plants, and
the rank growth of vegetation. [Amended 5-21-2018 by Ord. No.

representative fails to comply with written directives from the Building
Inspector requiring the construction of any required improvement such
as driveway, sidewalk or landscaping and/or the repair of any damage
to Village infrastructure resulting from construction, the Village may
perform the required work as needed and deduct the cost of such work
from the residential building bond.

owner shall remain responsible for reimbursing the Village for all actual
costs and expenses incurred to ensure compliance with the
requirements of this section.

alter or move such building within or into the municipality.
C. Continuous movement. The movement of buildings shall be a
continuous operation during all the hours of the day, and day by day and
at night, until such movement is fully completed. All of such operations
shall be performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares.
No building shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street
crossing or intersection, or so near thereto as to prevent easy access to
any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lighted lanterns shall be
kept in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night.
D. Street repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall
within one day after said building reaches its destination, report that
fact to the Inspector who shall thereupon in the company of the
Municipal Highway Commissioner, inspect the streets and highways
over which said building has been moved and ascertain their condition.
If the removal of said building has caused any damage to any street or
highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith
place them in good repair as they were before the permit was granted.
On the failure of said permittee to do so within 10 days thereafter to the
satisfaction of the governing body, said body shall repair the damage
done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the
sureties on his bond responsible for the payment of same.
E. Conformance with code. No permit shall be issued to move a building
within or into the municipality and to establish it upon a location within
the said municipality until the Inspector has made an investigation of
such building at the location from which it is to be moved, and is
satisfied from such investigation that said building is in a sound and
stable condition and of such construction that it will meet the
requirements of this Building Code in all respects. A complete plan of
all further repairs, improvements and remodeling with reference to
such building shall be submitted to the Inspector, and he shall make a
finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and
remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of the Building
Code, and that when same are completed, the building as such will so
comply with said Building Code. In the event a building is to be moved
from the municipality to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the
provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for
proposed alterations to such building may be disregarded.

with any claims for damages to any persons or property and the
payment of any judgment, together with the costs and expenses
incurred by the municipality in connection therewith, arising out of
the removal of the building for which the permit is issued.83
(2) Unless the Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be a fact
that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building from
its foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as to
permit the accidental falling therein of travelers or the location,
nature and physical characteristics of the premises and the falling
into such excavation of children under 12 years of age unlikely, the
bond required by Subsection F(1) shall be further conditioned upon
the permittee erecting adequate barriers and within 48 hours,
filling in such excavation or adopting and employing such other
means, devices or methods approved by the Inspector and
reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences set
forth herein.

photographs of all sides and views of the same, and in case it is
proposed to alter the exterior of said building, plans and
specifications of such proposed alterations and after a view of the
building proposed to be moved and of the site at which it is to be
located, that the exterior architectural appeal and functional plans
of the building to be moved or moved and altered, will not be so at a
variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functions
plan of the building already contracted or in the course of
construction in the immediate neighborhood, or the character of

A. Declaration of policy. The Village Board finds and declares that the
public health, comfort and safety is preserved and enhanced by the
provision of the sewerage system in the promotion of a clean and
healthful environment and that the failure to connect to the sewerage
system is contrary to minimum health standards.
B. Connection.
(1) To assure preservation of public health, comfort and safety, the
owner of any house, building or property used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation or other habitation, situated
within the Village and adjacent to a public sewer or in a block
through which a public sewer extends shall connect to such system
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within 365 days as
specified in a written notice to connect from the Village Board or
designated official, or if an immediate hazard exists within 30 days
upon receipt of notice from the Village Board or designated official.
(2) If any person fails to comply with Subsection B(1) above, the
Village, at its option, may take any or all of the following actions,
which are not mutually exclusive, and which shall be in addition to
other applicable penalties and remedies:
(a) Impose damages, penalties and remedies pursuant to § 398-16
of this chapter.
(b) Cause such connection to be made and the expense of the
connection shall be assessed as a special tax against the
property. The owner may, within 30 days after the completion
of the work by the Village, file a written option with the Village
Treasurer stating that he or she cannot pay the amount in one
sum and ask that it be levied in not to exceed five equal annual
installments and that the amount shall be so collected with
interest at a rate not to exceed 15% per year from the
completion of the work. The unpaid balance shall be a special
tax lien against the property.
168. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.

sewerage system, for an amount equal to 100% of the sewer
use charge as defined in § 398-7C of this chapter, payable
monthly for the period in which the failure to connect
continues. In the event the applicable house, building or
property is not connected to metered water, the sewer use
charge shall be calculated based upon an estimate of water
used by the facility as determined by the Village Board or its
designee, which estimate shall be stated in the notice to the
property owner. Upon failure to make such a payment, said
charge shall be imposed against the lot or parcel as a special
charge pursuant to § 66.0627, Wis. Stats.

prevention valve installed at the owner's expense.
(6) User use only. No user shall allow other persons to connect to or
permit other uses to be made of the sewerage system through his
or her lateral.
(7) Vacating of premises and discontinuance of service. Whenever
premises served by the sewerage system are to be vacated, or
whenever any person desires to discontinue service from the
system; the Village must be notified in writing. The owner of the
property shall be liable for any damages to the property of the
system other than through the fault of the system or its employees,
representatives, or agents.
(8) User to permit inspection. Every user shall permit the Village or its
authorized agent at all reasonable hours of the day to enter their
premises or building to examine the pipes and fixtures and the
manner in which the drains and sewer connections operate. Should
the owner or occupant of the premises refuse voluntary access to
the premises, the Building Inspector is authorized to seek a special
inspection warrant under § 66.0119, Wis. Stats.172
(9) Responsibility. No claim shall be made against the Village or its
agents or employees by reasons of the breaking, clogging,
stoppage or freezing of any service pipe, nor from any damage
arising from repairing mains, making connections or extensions or
any other work that may be deemed necessary by the Village,
absent of gross negligence of the Village, its agents or employees.

(1) All laterals will be installed in accordance with the Wisconsin
Administrative Code as from time to time amended.173
(2) All laterals installed in the public right-of-way shall be a minimum
of six inches in diameter.
(3) The building sewer shall be inspected by the Building Inspector or
his designee upon completion of placement of the pipe and before
backfilling, and tested before and after backfilling. The Building
Inspector or his designee may order any lateral exposed and
removed if such lateral is covered before inspection.
H. Private sewer lines. Any private sewer lines serving more than one
building or any private laterals over 300 feet within the public road
right-of-way shall be designed to meet the requirements for public
sewerage systems in Ch. NR 110, Wis. Adm. Code.
I. Sewer connections to the mains. No persons except those having
special permission from the Village or persons in its service and
approved by the Village will be permitted under any circumstances to
connect to the public sanitary sewers. The kind and size of the
connection to the public sanitary sewers shall be that specified in the
permit or order from the Village. A minimum of 48 hours' notice shall be
given to the Village prior to connecting to any main.174
J. Extensions. The Village shall extend sewer mains to a new person(s) in
accordance with the following charges and the following conditions:
(1) When an extension of a sewer main is required by the prospective
user, said person shall make an application on such a form as is
prescribed for that purpose for such an extension in writing to the
Village Board or designated official. The Village Board or
designated official shall determine the length, diameter and
location of the extension, taking into consideration the prospective
demands for service, the capacity of downstream facilities, and the
orderly development of the particular area. No extension shall be
made for a distance less than the distance to the next manhole. All
sewer extensions shall be constructed in compliance with local and
state laws, ordinances, and regulations.
(2) When a sewer main is extended in response to a request by a
prospective user, the Village may finance the cost to extend the
main and place a special assessment for the cost of the extension
on the property of the person(s) who made the request and other
benefitting properties. If the Village determines that, in order to

serve future development, the sewer main extension needs to be
of a greater diameter than is necessary to serve the property of
the applicant, the Village may pay for the difference in the cost of
the materials necessary to oversize the main to serve said future
development and shall not include such difference in materials cost
in the special assessments. All labor costs to install the sewer main
extension shall be included in the special assessment.175
(3) The Village Board may require the developer to enter a developer
agreement between the Village and the developer that shall state
the share of the costs of the sewer main extension that will be paid
for by the developer or prospective user.
(4) In addition to the charges made as above provided to each lot, each
user shall pay the full cost of the lateral from the main to their
building.
K. Chloride reduction. As required by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources and in order to reduce chloride in wastewater
treated in the wastewater treatment plant, the following rule is created
with regard to water softener installation:
(1) Water softeners. All new or replacement water softeners installed
in residential, commercial, industrial and institutional buildings
within the Village limits and in all sanitary districts and utility
districts served by the Village wastewater treatment facility shall
be "demand-based" water softeners. Water softeners functioning
only at predetermined time intervals shall no longer be permitted
in the Village, sanitary districts, and utility districts.
A. General.
(1) It shall be the policy of the Sewer Utility to establish sewer service
charges in such amount as to obtain sufficient revenues to pay the
following costs: 1. operation and maintenance including
contributions to a replacement fund; 2. debt service including debt
service reserves and coverage requirements.
(2) Those aspects of sewerage service charges relating to operation,
maintenance and replacement fund shall be in accord with any
relevant and applicable requirements imposed by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources or by federal law.
(3) The utility may establish sewer service charges including sewer
user charges, monthly fixed charges, septage charges, ready to
serve charges, charges to extraterritorial users and other charges
as deemed necessary by the Village Board so as to assure that each
175. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 398-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-7
1:207
user of the sewerage system pays its proportionate share of the
cost of such facilities.
(4) A review of the user charge system shall be conducted on an annual
basis. This review shall include an analysis of the total costs of the
system and of wastewater contribution of users and user classes.
(5) The charges established hereunder may be developed using a
utility rate-making method, which would include recovery of
operation and maintenance costs plus depreciation and a return on
investment.
B. Budget to be prepared. On an annual basis, the Village Administrator
shall prepare a Sewer Utility Budget. The budgeted revenues shall be
sufficient to cover projected operation, maintenance and debt service
costs of the sewerage utility.
C. User charge.
(1) A user charge is hereby imposed upon all users of the sewer
system. The user charge will recover the component of total
operation, maintenance and capital costs of the sewerage system,
which relates to sewage flow attributable to users of the system.
The user charge shall be based upon the cost of treating flow, BOD,
suspended solids and phosphorus at the strength of domestic
wastewater. The User charge shall consist of a volumetric charge in
terms of dollars per unit of metered water usage. The basis for
billing user charges shall be metered water usage. For users
assigned a residential equivalent connection (REC), as defined in
§ 398-7K; the REC shall be the basis for the user charge.
(2) If any user of the sewer system is allowed by the Village to procure
any part or all of his water from sources other than the Water
Utility, the user shall furnish, install and maintain at his or her
expense water meters of a type approved by the Water Utility for
the purpose of determining the volume of sewage discharged to the
sewer system. At the discretion of the Village, a user procuring
water from other sources than the Water Utility may be assigned a
residential equivalent connection (REC) to be used as a basis for
the user charge as determined from § 398-7K. If in the opinion of
the Village Engineer the information in § 398-7K does not
accurately reflect the user's wastewater discharge to the sewerage
system, then the Village Engineer may assign a REC to the user.
The user charge for non-metered users shall be based upon an
estimated usage equivalent to the number of assigned RECs
multiplied by the average annual residential sewer usage.
(3) The residential water consumption for sprinkling as determined by
the Water Utility and any water credit meters for any refrigeration,
air conditioning system or industrial cooling water not entering the
sewer system shall not be used in computing the user charge.
§ 398-7 SLINGER CODE § 398-7
1:208
D. Monthly fixed charge. A monthly fixed charge is hereby imposed upon
each user connected to the sewerage system. The monthly fixed charge
shall recover costs related to wastewater treatment flow not directly
attributable to users (infiltration/inflow) and customer costs (including
accounting and billing). The monthly fixed charge shall be levied to
each lateral connection to the sewerage system and will consist of a flat
fee per connection.
E. Surcharges for certain industrial users. A surcharge shall be levied on
all users of the system who discharge wastes that have concentrations
of BOD, suspended solids or phosphorus greater than domestic
wastewater. The surcharge shall apply to any additional loadings over
and above that which would be generated on wastes at a strength equal
to domestic wastewater. The volume of flow used for computing waste
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption or the actual
volume of waste as determined by a sampling and metering manhole or
a discharge monitoring station. The amount of surcharge shall reflect
the cost incurred by the Village in removing BOD, suspended solids and
phosphorus.
F. Standby charge. A standby charge shall be imposed on each property to
which the Village has made sewer service available and a connection to
the system for service has not been made within 365 days from the date
of notice by the Village that the sewer service is available. The standby
charge shall be equal to 100% of the sewer use charge as defined in
§ 398-7C. In the event the applicable house, building or property is not
connected to metered water, the sewer use charge shall be calculated
based upon an estimate of water used by the facility as determined by
the Village approving authority or its designee, which estimate shall be
stated in the notice to the property owner.
G. Hauled waste charge.
(1) Charges shall be imposed for hauled waste treatment and disposal.
Charges for hauled waste discharges shall be based on flow, BOD,
TSS, phosphorus and such other constituents that affect the cost of
treatment and disposal. The volume of flow used for computing the
hauled waste charge will be the volume of hauled waste
discharged. All persons discharging hauled waste that has
concentrations greater than domestic wastewater shall be subject
to a surcharge. The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost
incurred by the Village for removing BOD, TSS, phosphorus and
other pertinent constituents.
(2) The following waste strength parameters shall serve as the basis
for computing the surcharge to be applied, unless the hauled waste
discharge is sampled and analyzed:
§ 398-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-7
1:209
Septic Tank Decant Holding Tank
BOD >1,000 mg/l 500 to 1,000 mg/l <500 mg/l
TSS >1,000 mg/l 250 to 1,000 mg/l <250 mg/l
Phosphorus >100 mg/l 20 to 100 mg/l <20 mg/l
(3) Any hauled waste with a waste strength greater than 1,000 mg/l of
BOD, 1,000 mg/l of TSS or 100 mg/l of Phosphorus shall be
considered septic tank waste for the purposes of imposing the
charge on hauled waste.
(4) All costs associated with administering the discharge of hauled
waste to the WTP, sample collection, laboratory analysis and billing
will be paid by the waste hauler.
H. Special rates. It is understood that the Village Board may at any time
hereafter set special rates for any large commercial service, industrial
use, extraterritorial areas, contract users or any other unique user that
does not readily fit into other categories of users.
I. Extraterritorial services.
(1) Municipal sanitary sewer service may be provided to
extraterritorial locations on request. Such service may require
municipal ownership of the interceptor and collection system,
excluding laterals, and shall require compliance with Village policy
pertaining to annexation.
(2) Except where negotiated and approved by the Village Board, the
Village shall not be held financially responsible for planning, design
or construction costs of the extraterritorial sewer system.
(3) Extraterritorial sewer recipients shall pay sewer user charges as
established by the Village.
J. Accounts and funds.
(1) Income and revenues derived by the Sewer Utility shall placed in
an account which is separate and distinct from the Village General
Fund.
(2) A replacement reserve fund shall be maintained with the purpose
of providing for the replacement of mechanical equipment in order
to maintain the capacity and performance for which the sewer
system facilities were designed. Other segregated funds (e.g. debt
reserve fund) may be established and maintained as necessary.
(3) The debt service fund shall contain all revenue transferred from
special assessment, tax incremental finance funds, property taxes,
residential equivalency charges and other sources intended for
debt. This fund shall be used only for the payment of principal and
interest and fees directly related to debt payments.

engineering and design costs unless the Village can demonstrate
that its legal, engineering and design costs which relate directly to
the public improvement for which the impact fees were imposed
exceed 10% of capital costs. Capital costs do not include other
noncapital costs to construct, expand, upgrade or improve public
facilities, the costs of equipment to construct, expand, upgrade or
improve public facilities or the costs for vehicles.
DEVELOPER  A person that constructs or creates a land
development.
IMPACT FEES  Cash fees imposed upon a developer under this
subsection.
LAND DEVELOPMENT  The construction or modification of
improvements to real property that creates additional residential
dwelling units within the Village of Slinger Sanitary Sewer Service
Area or that results in nonresidential uses that create a need for
new, expanded, or improved public facilities within the Village of
Slinger Sanitary Sewer Service Area.
RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT CONNECTION (REC)  A unit of
measure for sewer-related impact fees equivalent to the average
amount of sewer capacity needed to supply one single-family
residential dwelling unit. For the purpose of the sanitary sewerage

the proposed development, subject to adjustment pursuant to
Subsection K(8)(b) below, shall be as follows:
[1] The sanitary sewerage facilities impact fee shall be $2,652
per REC, subject to adjustment as described in Subsection
K(8)(b) below.
[2] For all residential users of the sanitary sewer system, the
following table shall be used to determine the number of
residential equivalent connections (REC) per dwelling unit
or building.
Residential Users REC
Condominium 1.00
Single-family home 1.00
Duplex 2.00
Multiple-family (2 bedrooms or
more)
1.00/unit
Multiple-family (1 bedroom or less) 0.75/unit
[3] For all nonresidential users of the sewer system,
anticipated sewer consumption shall be estimated from
the following table for purposes of computing sewer
impact fees unless the Village Engineer/Public Works
Director determines that the information in the table does
not accurately reflect the user's anticipated sewer
consumption, in which case the Village Engineer/Public
Works Director will estimate sewer consumption. The
RECs will be determined by dividing the estimated sewer
consumption by the sewer consumption for 1 REC. Upon
§ 398-7 SLINGER CODE § 398-7

[4] Since the impact fee determined under Subsection
K(5)(b)[1] or [3] above is based upon the estimated
intended usage, the Village shall have the right to
recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for a
twelve-month period. At any time between the first and
third anniversary dates of establishment of the
nonresidential sewer service account, the Village may
review the account history to determine the highest actual
recorded usage in a twelve-month period.
[5] Based upon the information obtained under Subsection
K(5)(b)[4], the Village may recalculate the impact fee. If
the recalculated charge exceeds that of the amount paid
for the original charge, the additional amount shall
become due and payable at the time the adjustment is
made.
§ 398-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-7
1:221
[6] Such fees collected by the Village shall be placed in a
special fund which shall be separate from the general fund
of the Village, and the special fund and all interest earned
thereon shall be used exclusively for the particular capital
costs for which the fee was imposed.
[7] Such fees shall be expended by the Village for the
aforesaid purpose within the time limits set forth in
§ 66.0617(9), Wis. Stats., or such fee amount paid along
with any interest that has accumulated shall be refunded
by the Village to the current owner(s) of the property with
respect to which such fee was imposed.
(6) Fee reduction. Any impact fee imposed under this subsection shall
be reduced to compensate for capital costs otherwise imposed by
the Village upon the land development subject to this subsection
for the same public facilities for which an impact fee has been
imposed under this subsection, including by way of special
assessments, special charges, land dedications, or any ordinance
adopted thereunder or any other items of value. Impact fees
imposed under this subsection shall also be reduced to compensate
for moneys received from the federal or state government
specifically to provide or pay for the public facilities for which the
impact fees under this subsection are imposed.
(7) Exemption from fees. The lawful new construction of a singlefamily
dwelling structure upon a nondivisible parcel of land
supporting or having supported a habitable single-family dwelling
structure razed or to be razed within one year of the date of the
issuance of a building permit for the new construction as part of the
new construction project shall be exempt from the fees imposed
under this chapter. Any new construction of a single-family
dwelling structure upon a single parcel of land, which project is
similar to but not exactly as described above to be exempt, may be
found to be exempt upon application to the Village Board and a
finding by the Village Board that such project does not bear a
rational relationship to the need for new, expanded, or improved
public facilities required to serve such development. The Village
Board may exempt or reduce impact fees for low-income housing
provided that no amount of an impact fee for which an exemption
or reduction is provided is shifted to any other development in the
land development in which the low-cost housing is located or to any
other land development in the municipality. Such application shall
be made to the Village Board prior to the payment of any fees under
this subsection.
(8) Administration and review.
(a) All fees collected and special accounts maintained under this
subsection shall be subject to administration by the Village
Treasurer. The Treasurer shall report annually to the Village
§ 398-7 SLINGER CODE § 398-7
1:222
§ 398-8. Method of billing and payment of charges.
Board with regard to all deposits, withdrawals, and fund
balances in these accounts. The purpose of the annual report
is to provide the Village Board with information necessary to
determine that all funds collected are spent within the time
required for the purpose intended and that the amount of fees
imposed continues to represent an equitable and reasonable
apportionment of the cost of public improvements and
requirements generated by land development. The revenue
and expenditure totals for each impact fee must also be
included in the Village's annual budget, and a summary of
the revenue and expenditure totals for each impact fee must
also be made available in the Village's annual budget summary
required under § 65.90(3)(a), Wis. Stats.
(b) As part of the annual budget process, the Village Board shall
review and consider for adoption the proposed impact fee
amounts set forth in the above Subsection K(5)(b)[1]. At such
time that the impact fee is adjusted to the maximum amount
calculated in the Public Facilities Needs Assessment ($2,652
per REC), the impact fees shall be increased annually at a rate
equal to the percentage change in the Engineering News
Record Construction Cost Index for the previous 12 months,
with the adjustment effective January 1 of each year. The
Village Treasurer or designee shall calculate the adjusted fees
and maintain a copy of the calculation and the adjusted impact
fees in the office of the Village Clerk.
(9) Appeal. Any developer upon whom an impact fee is imposed under
this subsection shall have the right to contest the amount,
collection or use of the impact fee to the Village Board, provided
that the developer files a written notice of appeal in the Village
Clerk's office within 90 days of when the fee is due and payable.
Such notice of appeal shall be entitled "Notice of Appeal of Impact
Fee" and shall state the developer's name, address, telephone
number, address (if available) and legal description of the land
development upon which the impact fee is imposed, and a
statement of the nature of and reasons for the appeal. The Village
Clerk shall schedule the appeal for consideration by the Village
Board at a regular meeting as soon as reasonably practicable under
the circumstances and shall notify the developer of the time, date
and place of such meeting, in writing, by regular mail, deposited in
the mail no later than at least three days before the date of such
meeting. Upon review of such appeal, the Village Board may adjust
the amount, collection, or use of the impact fee upon just and
reasonable cause shown.
A. Terms of payment. Sewer service charges shall be for the
corresponding period of the water bills and shall be payable to the
§ 398-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 398-8
1:223
Village. Statements for such charges and assessments levied and
assessed in accordance with this chapter shall become due and payable
within 20 days after date of issuance. A penalty of 1% per month
shall be added to all bills not paid by the date fixed for final payment.
[Amended 12-3-2018 by Ord. No. 11-01-2018]
B. Billing. The property owner is held responsible for all sewer bills on
premises that he or she owns. All sewer bills and notices of any nature
relative to the sewer service will be addressed to the owner and/or
occupant and delivered to the addressee by first class mail.
C. Failure to receive bill, no penalty exemption. Every reasonable care will
be exercised in the proper delivery of sewer bills. Failure to receive a
sewer bill, however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility for
payment of sewer charges within the prescribed period nor exempt any
person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment
thereof. [Amended 12-3-2018 by Ord. No. 11-01-2018]
D. Delinquent accounts.
(1) Authority. The Village Board of the Village of Slinger adopts
§ 66.0821(4)(d), Wis. Stats., by reference.
(2) Procedure. On October 15 in each year, notice shall be given by the
Village Treasurer to the owner or occupant of all lots or parcels of
real estate to which utility service has been furnished prior to
October 1 and payment for which is owing and in arrears at the
time of giving such notice. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
state the amount of such arrears, including any penalty assessed
pursuant to the rules of the Sewer Utility; that unless the
delinquent account is paid by November 1 thereafter, a penalty of
10% of the amount of such arrears will be added thereto; and that
unless such arrears, with any such added penalty, shall be paid by
November 15 thereafter, the same will be placed as a special
charge against the lot or parcel of real estate to which utility
service was furnished and for which payment is delinquent. Such
notice may be served by delivery to either such owner or occupant
personally or by letter addressed to such owner or occupant at the
post office addresses of such lot or parcel of real estate. On
November 16, the Village Treasurer shall certify and file with the
Clerk a list of all lots or parcels of real estate, giving the legal
descriptions thereof, to the owners or occupants of which notice of
arrears in payment where given as above specified and which
arrears still remain unpaid, and stating the amount of such arrears
together with the added penalty thereon as herein provided.176
(3) Lien for delinquent charges. Each delinquent amount for sewer
service, including penalty, shall thereupon become a lien upon the
lot or parcel of real estate to which the utility service was furnished
176. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).

and payment for which is delinquent, and the Village Clerk shall
insert the same as a special charge against such lot or parcel of
real estate. All proceedings in relation to the collection of general
property taxes and to the return and sale of property for delinquent
taxes shall apply to said delinquent special charge if the same is
not paid within the time required by law for payment of taxes upon
real estate.177
(4) Sewer service to rental dwelling units. This section applies only if
all of the following conditions are met:
(a) Sewer Utility service is provided to a rental dwelling unit.
(b) The owner of the rental dwelling unit notifies the Utility in
writing of the name and address of the owner.
(c) If requested by the Utility, the owner of the rental dwelling unit
provides the Utility with a copy of the rental or lease
agreement in which the tenant assumes responsibility for the
payment of the utility charges.
(5) Compliance. The Sewer Utility shall comply with at least one of the
following methods of notification:
(a) The Sewer Utility shall send bills for sewer service to a
customer who is a tenant in the tenant's own name. Upon
notification to a customer who is a tenant that charges for
sewer service provided by the Utility to the customer are past
due for more than one billing cycle, the Utility shall also serve
a copy of the notice on the owner of the rental dwelling unit in
the manner provided in § 801.14(2), Wis. Stats. If a customer
who is a tenant vacates the rental dwelling unit and the owner
of the rental dwelling unit provides the public utility, no later
than 21 days after the date on which the tenant vacates the
rental dwelling unit, with a written notice containing a
forwarding address for the tenant and the date that the tenant
vacated the rental dwelling unit, the Utility shall continue to
send past due notices to the customer at his or her forwarding
address until the past due charges are paid or until notice has
been provided the owner of the rental dwelling unit in the
manner set forth below.
(b) The Sewer Utility shall serve notice of the past due charges on
the owner of the rental dwelling unit within 14 days of the date
on which the tenant's charges become past due. The public
utility shall serve notice on the owner of the rental dwelling
unit in the manner provided in § 801.14(2), Wis. Stats.

determined by the Village Engineer.
F. Limitations on wastewater strength.
(1) National categorical pretreatment standards as promulgated by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shall be met by all
dischargers of the regulated industrial categories.
(2) State requirements and limitations on discharges to the
wastewater treatment plant shall be met by all dischargers which
are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are
more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those
in this or any other applicable ordinance.
(3) The Authority reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide
for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
wastewater treatment plant where deemed necessary to comply
with the objectives set forth in this chapter.
(4) No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in
any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting
a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
chapter.

§ 398-11. Sand and grease trap installations. [Amended 12-3-2018
by Ord. No. 11-01-2018]
Sand and grease traps shall be required at restaurants, repair garages,
gasoline stations, car washes and other industrial or commercial
establishments for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease
in excessive amounts, oil, flammable wastes, sand and other harmful
ingredients. Individual exemptions from this requirement may be granted
upon review by the Utilities Superintendent to "Category 1" restaurants
as defined by the Washington County Health Department under their
restaurant licensing program. All sand and grease traps shall be
constructed in accordance with the Wisconsin Plumbing Code and shall
be located as to be readily and easily accessible for easy cleaning and
inspection. The Village reserves the right to inspect all sand and grease
traps to ensure proper maintenance and effective operation. All sand and
grease traps shall be maintained by the owner at his or her expense in
continuous, efficient operation at all times. Maintenance reports shall be
submitted to the Utilities Superintendent annually, by January 31, detailing
all maintenance performed during the previous year. In the maintaining
of these interceptors, the discharger shall be responsible for the proper
removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and
shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject
to review by the Village.
§ 398-12. Hauled waste disposal.
A. Waste haulers. All waste haulers shall be licensed disposers in
accordance with § 281.48, Wis. Stats.
B. Hauled waste discharge permit. All waste haulers wishing to discharge
to the Village wastewater treatment plant shall possess a waste haulers
discharge permit prior to disposing of any wastes at the WWTP. Every
licensed disposer wishing to discharge hauled waste shall file a
nonrefundable filing fee and an application in writing to the Village
Engineer in such a form as is prescribed for that purpose. Forms for
such application will be furnished by the Village Engineer. The Village
Engineer will evaluate the applications and make a determination as to
the amount and conditions of hauled waste disposal at the WWTP. Every
sewage disposer shall file a certificate of insurance with the Village
prior to the Village issuing a discharge permit. The insurable amount
shall be equal to $300,000 for general liability, $300,000 for automobile
liability and the statutory limit for workers compensation.
C. Truck registration. Each truck of a permitted waste hauler discharging
to the WWTP shall be registered with the Village. Registered trucks will
be shown how to properly log in by utility personnel and given a log-in
procedure sheet for future reference. Any truck that does not follow the
procedure will not be allowed to discharge until properly registered.
D. Restrictions on disposal. Each hauled waste disposal permit shall be
issued subject to the conditions that if at any time the WWTP has
§ 398-11 SLINGER CODE § 398-12
1:230
operational problems, maintenance problems or threat of a WPDES
permit violation that are indirectly or directly related to hauled waste
disposal, the Village may immediately restrict hauled waste disposal
until such time as corrective action or mitigative measures have been
taken. Restriction may include prohibition of disposal of hauled waste.
E. Approved hauled waste only. The WWTP will accept only hauled waste
from domestic origin and permitted industrial or commercial hauled
waste. Waste haulers must characterize the waste they haul to the
WWTP. Hauled industrial and/or commercial waste will not be accepted,
unless the industry or commercial establishment has received a
wastewater discharge permit as specified in this section or has received
permission from the Village. Any new industrial or commercial hauled
waste must be reported to the Village by the waste hauler.
F. Designated receiving station. The designated hauled waste receiving
station is located at the WWTP. All hauled waste shall be discharged at
the WWTP, unless approval is obtained from the Village Engineer and/or
Utilities Superintendent for discharge of hauled waste to other
locations in the sewer system. [Amended 12-3-2018 by Ord. No.
11-01-2018]
G. Hours of operation. Specific hours of discharge and conditions shall be
set by the Utilities Superintendent. No special exceptions to the hauled
waste station hours of operation will be allowed. [Amended
12-3-2018 by Ord. No. 11-01-2018]
H. Documentation. Waste haulers are required to submit records of the
discharge to the hauled waste receiving station to the Department of
Natural Resources. These records shall be made available for
inspection by the Village upon request.
I. Spills. Waste haulers shall clean up all spills or deposits resulting from
their activity at the WWTP. Additional expenses shall be charged to the
waste hauler for cleanup of any spills, deposits or damage occurring as
the result of the disposer's activity at the WWTP.
J. Random sampling. At its discretion, the Village shall conduct testing of
random samples of hauled waste. If the hauled waste that is tested is of
a higher waste strength than that which was reported by the waste
hauler, the Village may charge the waste hauler retroactively for the
difference between the previous six month's volume of waste at the
waste strength of the tested sample and the amount that was actually
charged to the waste hauler based on reported waste strengths.
K. Hauled waste charges. Charges for disposal of hauled waste will be
established from time to time by the Village Board and approved by
resolution of the Village Board in accordance with § 398-7 of this
chapter.

design loading for volume, COD, suspended solids or any other
pollutant.
B. Application procedure. Any such persons planning to discharge,
changing the characteristics of their discharge or whose discharge
permit has expired shall make application to the Village 60 days prior to
the discharge. All persons currently discharging shall make application
to the Village within 50 days after passage of this chapter. A discharge
permit will be required for each separate point of discharge into the
Village's sewer system. No person shall discharge waste or wastewater
into the Village sewer system without a wastewater discharge permit, if
required by this section.
C. Village acceptance of waste. If any wastewater is discharged, or
proposed to be discharged, to the public sewerage system containing
substances which in the judgment of the Village Board or designated
official may be detrimental to the sewerage system, the Village Board or
designated official may:

shall be used to determine the applicable surcharge.181
(3) Waste or wastewater discharge may be sampled manually or by the
use of mechanical equipment as necessary to obtain a
representative twenty-four-hour composite sample. Samples shall
be taken at intervals to be established by contractual agreement
under § 398-13H or at intervals as determined by the Utilities
Superintendent or the Village Engineer. All costs for such sampling
shall be charged directly to the owner of the premises from which
the sampled discharge is generated. The sampling may be done by
Village personnel or their designee or may be requested to be done
by the facility owner. If the owner is requested to perform the
sampling, the selected method, contractor, or laboratory must be
pre-approved by the Village.
(4) When Ch. NR 101 or NR 202, Wis. Adm. Code, requires the
submittal of the character and concentration of wastes, waste
volume and production information to the district or State DNR, the
user shall have the waste character and concentration determined
by a DNR certified testing laboratory. A copy of the test results and
DNR reports shall be submitted to the Village Engineer.
(5) All measurements and test analysis of the characteristics of
industrial wastes shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR
136 methods approved by the Utilities Superintendent and shall
comply with state and federal law.
H. Contractual agreement. All persons required to make application for a
wastewater discharge permit shall, before issuance of the permit, enter

agreement shall contain the conditions set forth in the discharge
permit, requirements for industrial cost recovery charges and other
items deemed necessary by the Village.
I. Duration of permits. A permit shall be issued for one year and shall be
automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis thereafter, unless the
person is notified by the Village 60 days prior to the expiration of the
permit or any renewal thereof or unless the discharger has signed a
discharge monitoring agreement with the Village which specifies a
different duration period. The terms and conditions of the permit shall
be subject to modification and change by the Village during the life of
the permit, if so required because of any ordinances, statutes or rules
and regulations of the approving authority of any applicable state or
federal body. The person shall be informed of any proposed changes in

changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.182
J. Transfer of a permit prohibited. Wastewater discharge permits are
issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation.
K. Revocation of permit. Any user who violates any of the conditions of his
or her permit contractual agreement or this chapter or of applicable
state and federal regulations is subject to having his or her permit
revoked.183
L. Discharge monitoring agreement. The Village may require an industrial
or any high volume or high strength waste discharger to enter into a
discharge monitoring agreement if in the judgment of the Village such
an agreement is necessary to properly evaluate the users discharge to
the sewerage system and/or to obtain adequate information to properly
assess a surcharge. In the absence of a discharge monitoring
agreement, the Village may assign a surcharge to a user, which in the
Village's judgment is appropriate of the user's discharge. The Village
may assess a surcharge to a user even though the Village does not
require the user to enter into a discharge monitoring agreement. A
sample of a discharge monitoring agreement is on file with the Village.
A. Damages. No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the sewerage system. Any

person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest
under charge of disorderly conduct.184
B. Permit revocation. Any licensed waste hauler or permitted industrial
discharger found to be violating a provision of this chapter or any
conditions of the discharge permit may have its approval immediately
revoked. This revocation shall be done in writing and shall state the
reasons for the revocation.
C. Accidental discharge. Any person found to be responsible for
accidentally allowing a deleterious discharge into the sewerage system
which causes damage to the sewerage system and/or receiving water
body shall, in addition to a fine, pay the amount to cover all damages,
both which will be established by the Village.
D. Liability for losses. Any person violating any provision of this chapter
shall become liable to the Village for any expense, loss, or damage
occasioned by reason of such violation which the Village may suffer as a
result thereof.
E. Damage recovery. The Village shall have the right of recovery from all
persons, any expense incurred by the sewerage system for the repair or
replacement of any part of the sewerage system damaged in any
manner by any person by the performance of any work under their
control, or by any negligent acts.
F. Penalties. In addition to, and not to the exclusion or prejudice of, any
such other penalties and remedies that may apply, any person who shall
violate any of the provisions of this chapter or rules or regulations of
the Village or who shall connect a service pipe or discharge without
first having obtained a permit therefor; or who shall violate any
provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes, Wisconsin Administrative Code, or
any other materials which are incorporated by reference, shall upon
conviction thereof be subject to a penalty as set forth in § 1-2 of the
Code. Each day in which any violation is continued beyond the aforesaid
notice time limit shall be deemed a separate offense. This, however,
shall not bar the Village from enforcing the connection duties set out in
§ 398-6 for mandatory connection.185
G. Appeal procedures. Any user affected by any decision, action or
determination, including cease-and-desist orders, made by the Village
official interpreting or implementing provisions of this chapter may file
with the Village Clerk's office a written request for reconsideration
within 15 days of the date of such decision, action, or determination,
setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's request for
reconsideration. Such appeal shall state the user's name, address,
telephone number, address, and a statement of the nature of and

§ 401-0. Preamble
WHEREAS, the Village Board of the Village of Slinger, Washington County,
Wisconsin, deems it a priority to act in the interest of public safety within
our community, particularly in the interest of our children: and
WHEREAS, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, there are a record
number of convicted sex offenders living in our communities186; and
WHEREAS, all convicted child sex offenders have proven themselves to be
dangerous187; and
WHEREAS, research in this area has established sex offenders are
rearrested for sex crimes four times more frequently than non-sex
offenders188; and
WHEREAS, the reduction of crime and criminal recidivism are inextricably
linked to public safety within our community; and
WHEREAS, the risks posed by sex offenders against children, are nationally
recognized in such landmark legislation as the 1994 Jacob Wetterling
Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act;
1996 Megan's Laws; and the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety
Act; and these risks are also recognized by legislation in every state in the
United States of America including Wisconsin; and
reasons for the appeal. The Village Clerk shall schedule the appeal
for consideration by the Village Board at a regular meeting as soon
as reasonably practicable under the circumstances and shall notify the
user of the time, date and place of such meeting, in writing, by regular
mail, deposited in the mail no later than at least three days before
the date of such meeting. Upon review of such appeal, the Village
Board may change such decision, action or determination upon just and
reasonable cause shown.

WHEREAS, the Village Board finds that the data concerning child sex
offenders is horrific and demonstrates the need for action, including the
following189:
 "sex crimes are unfortunately fairly common in the United States."
 "It is estimated that one in every five girls and one in every seven boys
are sexually abused by the time they reach adulthood."
 "Children are particularly vulnerable. Approximately 67% of all victims
of reported sexual assaults are under the age of 18, and more than half of
these victims are under the age of 12."
 "Most sexual offenses are committed by someone the victim knows . . .
or acquaintance."
 "No single factor or combination of factors can fully explain why
someone offends sexually, though some factors may combine to increase
people's tendency to offend. These factors are ... [physiological,
sociocultural, developmental] and situational/circumstantial (e.g. having
easy access to victims ...)."
 "About 12% to 24% of sex offenders will reoffend."
WHEREAS, the Village Board also finds these statistics of the U.S.
Department of Justice to be shocking and a call to action190:
 "Approximately 1.8 million adolescents in the United States have been
victims of sexual assault.
 "An estimated 60% of perpetrators of sexual abuse are known to the
child but are not family members, e.g. family friends, babysitters, child
care providers, neighbors."
WHEREAS, the creation of sex offender residency restrictions and safety
zones by municipal ordinance around locations where children regularly
congregate is a reasonable step toward protecting our children and
deterring recidivism by reducing the opportunity for new offenses within
our community; and
WHEREAS, the Village Board has reviewed many studies and reports
concerning recidivism of sex offenders and the effectiveness of sex offender
residency restrictions191, and has been fully advised in the matter; and
189. Note: Center for Sex Offender Management (CSOM) statistics. CSOM is a collaborative

WHEREAS, the literature on the subject includes some studies that support
the practice of imposing sex offender residency restrictions and others that
are critical of the practice; and
WHEREAS, the Village Board finds it to be significant that some of the
key studies that have concluded that sex offender residency restrictions
have limited effectiveness have added significant qualifications to that
conclusion; e.g. in "An Evaluation of Sex Offender Residency Restrictions
in Michigan and Missouri," (Huebner, et al., 2013), the authors generally
do not support sex offender residency restrictions, but nevertheless find
that following adoption of sex offender residency restrictions "the rate of
recidivism for technical violations significantly decreased for Missouri sex
offenders. . ." (id. at 9) and the number of sex offense convictions did
decline. . ." in Missouri (id. at 10); and
WHEREAS, the Village Board recognizes the merits, mentioned in some
studies, of individualized consideration of the risks and benefits of residency
restrictions on an offender-by-offender basis, though this assessment of
risks is not a perfect science and could give rise to equal protection or
other enforcement concerns; and on the local level it is important to provide
clear information to those who may want to locate in the Village, including
a map of available residency locations; and the Village Board finds that
this desire for uniformity and clarity outweighs the desire for individualized
consideration at the Village level, in general; and
WHEREAS, in review of the residency restrictions of communities
throughout Washington County and its environs, the Village Board finds
that many of such communities have an "original domicile restriction,"
which allows each community to take back its own while not adding an
additional burden of more than its own sex offenders to its community; such
burdens including neighborhood and citizen concerns and responses, risks
of recidivism, and potential property value impacts192; and

non-profit organization devoted to sex offender research, offers this advice to those
concerned about sex offenders moving into a neighborhood, among others: Create a family
safety plan; attend notification meetings; notify the police of suspicious activity; and don't
wait to take action for prevention. At a minimum, this heightened awareness and activity
§ 401-0 SLINGER CODE § 401-0
1:240
WHEREAS, if the Village of Slinger would not have an original domicile
restriction, the Village would have open doors for nonresident sex offender
residency when other communities have closed doors, inviting a substantial
increase in child sex offender placements, with the related adverse impacts
on the health, safety and welfare of the Village and its residents; and
WHEREAS, the Village Board believes that for all but the most severe
offenders, this risk of adverse impact declines as time passes following the
date of a designated offender's offense, as the offender matures, recovers
and reintegrates with society over time; and if this results in the offender
being removed from the state registration list, the offender is thereby
automatically removed from the Village residency restrictions; but even if
state registration is required, once 10 years has passed since the date on
which the person was released from prison or placed on parole, probation,
extended supervision or other supervised release for the sex offense,
provided it is not a Class A felony against a child, the Village Board finds
it is appropriate to remove the original domicile restriction and allow such
reformed citizen to move into the Village of Slinger in compliance with
this ordinance; and by opening this door the Village Board hopes that it
is establishing a precedent for its surrounding communities to open their
doors as well; and
WHEREAS, the Village Board recognizes that it cannot eliminate all risk of
child sex offender re-offense, and it must balance all of the competing public
policies, but intends by these regulations to strike the legislative balance
that is appropriate for the circumstances of the Village of Slinger; and
WHEREAS, it is not the intent of this chapter to banish sex offenders from
residing within the Village of Slinger, and careful attention has been given
to ensure that there are ample locations for sex offenders to reside within
the Village of Slinger in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
§ 401-1. Residency and safety restrictions for sex offenders.
The Wisconsin Statutes govern the punishment of individuals who commit
sex crimes. The Wisconsin Statutes also govern the release into the
community of such individuals. The Village of Slinger has no authority or
intent to intervene in either area. The Village of Slinger recognizes statutory
residency restrictions and the limited exemptions enumerated in § 980.135,
Wis. Stats., for sex offenders released pursuant to § 980.08, Wis. Stats.
§ 401-2. Purpose.
This chapter is a nonpunitive, civil regulatory measure aimed at protecting
the public health, safety and welfare of the children and citizens of the
Village of Slinger from the risk that convicted sex offenders may re-offend
in locations close to their residences. The Village finds and declares that
sex offenders who prey upon children are a serious threat to public safety
burdens the families and neighbors where sex offenders are placed, and collectively this
burdens the Village staff and resources, for every Designated Offender placement.
§ 401-0 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 401-2
1:241
and it is necessary for the Village to enact reasonable measures to reduce
the opportunity and minimize the risk of re-offense by protecting children
where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections
afforded by state law near schools and other places children frequent.
§ 401-3. Definitions.

STORMWATER UTILITY
GENERAL REFERENCES
Stormwater management and erosion
control  See Ch. 526.
§ 419-1. Findings and declaration of policy.
The Village of Slinger finds that the management of stormwater and other
surface water discharges within and beyond the Village of Slinger is a
matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the Village, its citizens
and businesses and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively
manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the
Village by, among other things, increasing infiltration to the sanitary sewer.
In addition, surface water runoff causes erosion of lands, damages to
businesses and residences, sedimentation, and other environmental
damage in the Village of Slinger. In order to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the public, the Village of Slinger is exercising its authority to
establish a Stormwater Utility for stormwater management services. The
Village is acting under the authority of §§ 61.34, 61.36, 62.04, 62.11, 62.16,
62.175, 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0627, 66.0809, 66.0811 and 66.0821, Wis. Stats.
§ 419-2. Establishment.
There is hereby established a Stormwater Utility in the Village of Slinger.
The operation of the stormwater utility shall be managed by the Director of
Public Works, under the supervision and control of the Village Board.
§ 419-3. Authority.
The Village, acting through the stormwater utility, may acquire, construct,
lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge,
repair, conduct, manage and finance such facilities, operations and
activities, as are deemed by the Village to be proper and reasonably
necessary for a system of storm and surface water management. These
facilities may include, without limitation due to enumeration, surface and
underground drainage facilities, watercourses, retaining walls, ponds,
streets, roads, ditches and such other facilities as will support a stormwater
management system.
§ 419-4. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be interpreted liberally to secure the ends sought hereby and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes.

term includes, without limitation due to enumeration, all areas covered by
structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways, sidewalks, parking
lots, pavement, gravel, compacted clay, and loading docks, all as measured
on a horizontal plane.
NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY  A lot or parcel of land, with
improvements such as a building, structure, other impervious areas as
defined in this § 419-5, grading or substantial landscaping, which is not
specifically zoned residential as shown on the Village's Official Zoning Map,

Works, aerial photography, property owner, tenant, or developer or site
plan approved by the Village Plan Commission. The Director of Public
Works may require additional information as necessary to make the
determination. The number of ERUs on any lot or parcel shall be
updated by the Director of Public Works based on any additions to the
impervious area as approved through the building permit process.

submit an adjustment request to the Director of Public Works. The
allocated ERUs may be adjusted if the owner can provide
information showing the square footage calculation for all
impervious surface area located on the lot or parcel.
B. Review and appeal procedure.
(1) Within 30 days of a properly submitted request to the Director of
Public Works for a review of the number of ERUs allocated to the
property, the Director of Public Works shall issue a written decision
as to whether the request for adjustment should be granted, denied
or granted in part. The written decision shall also set forth the
reason or reasons for such decision. The decision shall be sent to
the customer by certified mail and shall be provided to the Village
Board.
(2) Within 30 days of receipt of the written decision from the Director
of Public Works, an appeal of the determination rendered by the
Director of Public Works may be submitted by the property owner
to the Village Clerk. The Village Board shall review the decision and
hold a hearing thereon. The customer shall be notified of the date
of the hearing by certified mail.

Assessments for Public Works
[Adopted as Sec. 8.10 of the former Municipal Code]
§ 425-27. Assessment philosophy.
§ 425-28. Method of calculating assessments.
A. All new infrastructure installed in new development may be the
responsibility of the developer.224
B. All new infrastructure installed in existing developments will be
assessed against the benefiting properties.
C. The replacement and/or repair of existing infrastructure will be paid for
by the Village of Slinger.
D. Repair or replacement of infrastructure damaged due to negligence,
neglect, or accident will be the sole responsibility of the negligent
party.225
A. The standard method of calculating an assessment for the initial
installation of infrastructure is as follows:
Assessable Cost
Assessable
Frontage
= Per-foot assessment
B. While the above-referenced assessment methodology will be the
standard assessment method for all infrastructure construction, the
Village Board at its sole discretion may also consider the following
methods based on the specific project:
(1) Front-foot basis.
(2) Per-parcel basis.
(3) Area-wide basis.
(4) Square-footage basis.
(5) Impervious surface (hydraulic acre) basis.

§ 425-29. Payment of assessment.226
The owner of property being assessed for the initial construction of any
infrastructure will be allowed to pay his assessment in terms determined by
the Village Board.
§ 425-30. Special considerations.
A. Multi-fronted lots. Assessment shall be adjusted for multi-fronted lots in
the following manner:
(1) Frontage on any constructed side in excess of 100 feet shall receive
a 75% forgiveness, up to a maximum of 100 feet.
B. Prohibited access. Any lot with frontage on a road where access to said
road is prohibited by a governing body shall have the assessment for
said infrastructure deferred until such time as the property is permitted
access to said road. At that time the property owner will be required to
pay the assessment as described in Subsection C.
C. Irregularly shaped lots. Irregularly shaped lots shall be assessed on the
following basis:
(1) When special assessments are based on a front-foot basis the
calculation for irregularly shaped lots (including triangular-shaped
lots) shall be as follows:
(a) When the actual front footage of an irregularly shaped lot is
greater than or less than the average width of all lots being
assessed (measured by dividing the total lot area being
assessed by the average lot width being assessed) the
assessable footage will be based on the average lot width. In no
event shall the assessment be for less than 75 feet of frontage.
[1] If a multi-fronted lot is split in two or more parcels prior to
completion of construction and assessment, the
assessment shall be calculated for the original lot and split
equally between the newly created lots.
[2] Nothing in this article shall be deemed a waiver of the
Village's ability to impose assessments in a manner
consistent with Wisconsin law or other applicable law,
including but not restricted to the Village's ability to
exercise police powers under Chs. 61 and 66, Wis. Stats.227

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Statement of Purpose,
Title and General Provisions
§ 481-1. Statutory authorization.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23,
Wis. Stats., for villages and cities; and the requirements in § 87.30, Wis.
Stats.
§ 481-2. Findings.
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.
§ 481-3. Purpose.
This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
§ 481-4. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the
Village of Slinger, Wisconsin."
§ 481-5. General provisions.
A. Protect life, health and property;
B. Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
C. Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
D. Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
F. Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
G. Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;
H. Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and
result in conflicts between property owners; and
I. Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the
floodplain.
A. Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be
covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by the Department
of Natural Resources. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood
§ 481-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 481-5
1:315
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30,
and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A
and AO Zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFEs) may be derived from
other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
B. Official maps and revisions.
(1) The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE,
AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or
any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the
FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed
and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map
Change process (see Article VIII, Amendments) before it is
effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be effective
until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in
the office of the Village Zoning Administrator, Village of Slinger. If
more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive
information shall apply.
(2) Official Maps.
(a) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) numbers as follows:
55131C0232D and 55131C0253D dated November 20, 2013
and 55131C0227E, 55131C0229E, 55131C0231E,
55131C0233E, 55131C0234E, 55131C0261E dated October
16, 2015; with corresponding profiles that are based on the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated October 16, 2015, for
Washington County, Wisconsin, and incorporated areas,
including Volume 1 FIS No. 55131CV001B, Volume 2 FIS No.
55131CV002B, and Volume 3 FIS No. 55131CV003B.
(b) Flood Storage Map, Panel number 3, dated October 16, 2015,
approved by the WI DNR.
C. Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain
areas are divided into four districts, as follows:
(1) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to
carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones
as shown on the FIRM.
(2) The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional
flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the
FIRM.
(3) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be
covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have
a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO
Zones on the FIRM.
§ 481-5 SLINGER CODE § 481-5
1:316
(4) The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain
where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional
flood discharge.
D. Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be
resolved using the criteria in Subsection D(1) or (2) below. If a
significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to
Article VIII, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a
boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use
permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district
boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning
Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be
settled according to § 481-28C and the criteria in Subsection D(1) and
(2) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood
elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or
revision pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.
(1) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(2) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
E. Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain
unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood
elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the
map is amended pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.
F. Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this
chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable local, state and federal regulations.
G. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13),Wis. Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways
and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt
when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
H. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(1) This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under § 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694, Wis. Stats., for
counties; § 62.23, Wis. Stats., for cities; § 61.35, Wis. Stats., for
villages; or § 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more
§ 481-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 481-5
1:317
restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the
extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(2) This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail.
I. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor
of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall
be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the
adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text
amendment to this chapter.
J. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in
this chapter are based on engineering experience and research. Larger
floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain
areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding
and flood damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of,
or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this
chapter.
K. Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.
L. Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Washington County
floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall
remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance
which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and 44
CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed
lands are described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map. County
floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall
show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance
requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if
the total cost to restore the structure to its predamaged condition
equals or exceeds 50% of the structure's present equalized
assessed value.
(8) For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or
destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of
any such nonconforming building shall be permitted in order to
restore it to the size and use in effect prior to the damage event,
provided that the minimum federal code requirements below are
met and all required permits have been granted prior to the start of
construction.

the stream reach for which the revision is being
requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream
of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations
and top widths computed by the revised models
matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The
effective model shall not be truncated.

supporting documentation or metadata must be
included with the data submission along with the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and
State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with
FEMA mapping specifications.
[e] The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries.
[f] All cross sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map and a
cross-section lookup table shall be included to relate

§ 495-13. Improvements.
Before approval of any final plat located within the corporate limits of
the Village, the subdivider shall install street and other improvements
as hereinafter provided. In the alternative, if such improvements are not

inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of Articles VII and VIII of
this chapter because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the Plan
Commission may waive or modify any requirement to the extent deemed
just and proper. Such relief shall be granted without detriment to the
public good, without impairing the intent and purpose of this Ordinance or
the desirable general development of the community in accordance with
an adopted Comprehensive Plan or component thereof. No exception or
modification shall be granted unless the Plan Commission finds that all the
following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its
proceedings:
on condition that the subdivider provide a letter of credit, certified
check, or surety bond equal to the estimated cost of installing the
monuments to ensure the placing of such monuments within the time
required by statute. Additional time may be granted upon show of
cause.
D. Plats outside corporate limits. Before final approval by the Village of
any plat located outside the corporate limits of the Village but within
the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the Village, the
subdivider shall give evidence that he or she has complied with all
street and utility improvement requirements of the Town in which of the
land being platted is located.
A. Exceptional circumstances. There are exceptional, extraordinary, or
unusual circumstances or conditions where a literal enforcement of the
requirements of this Ordinance would result in severe hardship. Such
hardships should not apply generally to other properties or be of such a
recurrent nature as to suggest that this Ordinance should be changed.
B. Preservation of property rights. That such exception or modification is
necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property
rights possessed by other properties in the same vicinity.
§ 495-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-15

Ordinance, until the provisions and requirements of this Ordinance have
been fully met. The Village may institute appropriate action or proceedings
to enjoin violations of this Ordinance.

Any person, firm, or corporation who fails to comply with the provisions
of this Ordinance shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $100
plus any additional applicable costs incurred by the Village for each offense,
and the penalty for default of payment of such forfeiture and costs shall be
imprisonment in the County Jail until payment thereof, but not exceeding six
months. Each day a violation exists or continues shall constitute a separate
offense. Violations and concomitant penalties shall include the following:

notification of the rejection of the plat. Where failure to approve is based
on an unsatisfied objection, the agency making the objection shall be made

shall be required to grant any exception or modification of this
Ordinance, and the reasons shall be entered into the minutes of the
Commission.

§ 495-19. Pre-application staff conference.
It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an application for the approval
of a preliminary plat, condominium plat, or certified survey map, the
subdivider consult with the Plan Commission and/or its staff in order to
obtain their advice and assistance. It is recommended that a conceptual
plan of the proposed subdivision, condominium, or certified survey map be
brought by the applicant to the meeting, but such conceptual plan is not
required. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended
to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations,
the Comprehensive Plan, and duly adopted plan implementation devices
of the Village and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning the
development. In so doing, both the subdivider and Plan Commission may
reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives
of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood
and community. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the
subsequent required procedures.

constitute automatic approval of the final plat, except that if the final
plat is submitted within 36 months after the last required approval of

A. The Maximum Error of Closure before adjustment of the survey of the
exterior boundary of the subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal
distance or position, the ratio of one part in 10,000, nor in azimuth, of
four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field measurements exceed this
maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory
closure is obtained. When a satisfactory closure of the field
measurements has been obtained, the survey of the exterior boundary
shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure.
B. All Street, Block, and Lot Dimensions shall be computed as closed
geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed
exterior boundary survey. If field checks disclose an error for any
interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of one part in 5,000, or an
error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle
where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer,
necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a
measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not
exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the quotient of 300 divided

Where the plat is located within a one-quarter section, the corners of which
have been located, monumented, and placed on the State Plane Coordinate
System through high order horizontal control surveys conducted to
standards established by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning
Commission, the plat shall be tied directly to two adjacent section or
quarter-section corners defining a quarter section line so located,
monumented, and placed on the State Plane Coordinate System. The grid
bearing and distance of each tie shall be determined by field measurements.
The Wisconsin State Plane Coordinates, together with a description of the
monuments marking the section or quarter-section corners to which the
plat is tied shall be shown on the plat. All distances and bearings shall be
referenced to the Wisconsin State Plane Coordinate System, South Zone,
based upon the North American Datum of 1927, and shall be adjusted to
the control survey network established to the standards promulgated by
the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission for the area
concerned. Where the field measurements differ from the control survey
data by more than one part in 10,000, in the alternative to adjusting the
field measured distances and bearings of the ties to the control survey
network, the surveyor shall show both the measured field distances and
bearings and the recorded and published control survey distances and
bearings concerned. Under this alternative, the discrepancies shall be
brought to the attention of the custodian of the control survey data for
the area concerned by the surveyor. All distances shall be recorded to the
nearest 0.01 foot and all bearings to the nearest one second of arc. The
grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be determined by a closed survey
meeting the error of closure herein specified for the survey of the exterior
boundaries of the subdivision.
§ 495-42. Certificates.
All final plats shall provide all the certificates required by Section 236.21 of
the Wisconsin Statutes; and, in addition, the surveyor shall certify that he
or she has fully complied with all the provisions of this Ordinance.
§ 495-43. Filing and recording.
Statute. In that case, the Village Engineer's examination required under
this section and any related field checks shall be made after the
required monuments have been installed. The letter of credit, certified
check, or surety bond concerned shall not be released until the Village
Engineer is satisfied with the accuracy of the land surveying concerned.

All certified survey maps shall provide all of the certificates required for
final plats by Section 236.21 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The Village Board
shall certify its approval on the face of the map. In addition, the surveyor
shown. The status of navigability of the lakes, ponds, rivers, streams,
creeks, and drainage ditches shall be indicated based upon a
determination by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
L. The Village Plan Commission may require that the entire area
contiguous to the land encompassed within the proposed certified
survey map and owned or controlled by the subdivider be included in
the certified survey map even though only a portion of said area is
proposed for immediate development. The Village Plan Commission
may also require the submission of a sketch plan, drawn to scale,
showing the entire contiguous holdings owned or controlled by the
subdivider and identifying proposed future development of the parcel,
including general street and parcel locations.

ARTICLE VII
Design Standards
§ 495-50. Street arrangement.
A. General requirements. In any new land division or condominium, the
street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width, type, and
location indicated on the adopted County jurisdictional highway system
plan, the adopted Village Official Map, or the adopted Village
Comprehensive Plan or plan component. In areas for which such plans
have not been completed, or are of insufficient detail, the street layout
shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of
streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing
and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as
streams and existing trees, to public convenience and safety, to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, and to the most
advantageous development of adjoining areas. The land division or
condominium shall be designed so as to provide each lot with
satisfactory frontage on a public street.
B. Arterial Streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to
centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community
shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the
boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated
with and related to the existing and planned system of arterial streets
and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in
alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to
connect.
C. Collector Streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of
traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the
arterial street and highway system and shall be properly related to the
arterial streets to which they connect.
D. Land Access Streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to
discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient
storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum
street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting
property.
E. Proposed Streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the lot, parcel, or
tract being subdivided or developed unless prevented by topography or
other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Plan
Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the land division or condominium or for the
advantageous development of adjacent lands.
F. Arterial street protection. Whenever an existing or planned arterial
street is located adjacent to or within a proposed land division or
condominium, adequate protection of residential lots, limitation of
access to the arterial street, and separation of through and local traffic
§ 495-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-50
1:407
§ 495-51. Limited access highway and railroad right-of-way
treatment.
Whenever a proposed land division or condominium contains or is adjacent
to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way the design shall provide
the following treatment:
shall be provided through the use of alleys, frontage streets, or culde-
sac or loop streets. A restricted non-access easement along any
property line abutting an arterial street may be required. Permanent
screening or landscape plantings may be required in any restricted nonaccess
area.
G. Development Control or Reserve Strips shall not be allowed on any plat
or certified survey map to control access to streets or alleys, except
where control of such strips is placed with the Village under conditions
approved by the Plan Commission.
H. Access shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts for offstreet
loading and service areas.
I. Street Names shall be approved by the Village and shall not duplicate
or be similar to existing street names elsewhere in the Village. Existing
street names shall be continued into the land division or condominium
wherever possible. Where an adopted Village or County street address
system plan exists, the street names shall be assigned in accordance
with the recommendations of such plan or plans.
A. Non-access easement and planting area. When lots within a proposed
land division or condominium back upon the right-of-way of an existing
or planned limited access highway or railroad, a non-access easement
and planting area at least 50 feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to
the highway or railroad right-of-way. The minimum lot depth required
by the Village zoning ordinance shall be increased by 50 feet to
accommodate the non-access easement and planting area. This nonaccess
easement and planting area shall be a part of all lots and shall
have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat or certified
survey map: "This area is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs.
No access shall be permitted across this area. The building of
structures, except public or private utility structures and fences, is
prohibited hereon."
B. Plats Located in Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts shall
provide, on each side of a limited access highway or railroad right-ofway,
streets approximately parallel to such highway or railroad. A
distance of not less than 150 feet shall be provided to allow for the
appropriate use of the land between such streets and the highway or
railroad.
C. Streets Parallel to a Limited Access Highway or railroad right-of-way,
when intersecting an arterial or collector street which crosses said
§ 495-50 SLINGER CODE § 495-51
1:408
§ 495-52. Street, bicycle, and pedestrian way design standards.
highway shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from
said street or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and
practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for the future separation of grades by means of
desirable approach gradients.
D. Land Access Streets immediately adjacent to arterial streets and
railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas.
A. Minimum width. The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all
proposed streets and alleys shall be as specified by the Comprehensive
Plan or component thereof, Official Map, or County jurisdictional
highway system plan. If no width is specified therein, the minimum
right-of-way and roadway widths for arterial, collector, and land access
streets shall be as shown on Table 1 for streets having an urban crosssection.
If the Plan Commission determines that a permanent rural
cross-section may be used, the minimum right-of-way and roadway
widths set forth in Table 2 shall apply.
B. Cross-Sections for collector and land access streets having an urban
cross-section shall be as shown on Table 1. If the Plan Commission
determines that a permanent rural cross-section may be used, the
cross-sections for collector and land access streets set forth in Table 2
shall apply. The cross-sections for arterial streets should be based on
detailed engineering studies. Appendix A contains cross-sections for
both urban and rural streets.
C. Cul-de-Sac Streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall
not exceed 1,000 feet in length unless provisions are made for adequate
emergency access and water main configuration. Cul-de-sac streets
shall terminate in a circular turnabout having a minimum right-of-way
radius of 75 feet. Cul-de-sac turnabouts with an urban cross-section
shall have a minimum outside face-of-curb radius of 61 feet; and have a
tapered landscaped island with a face-of-curb radius of 37 feet at its
widest end, a face-of-curb radius of 20 feet at its narrowest end, and a
length of 100 feet. Cul-de-sac turnabouts with a rural cross-section
shall have a minimum outside pavement radius of 53 feet; and have a
tapered landscaped island with a face-of-curb radius of 35 feet at its
widest end, a face-of-curb radius of 20 feet at its narrowest end, and a
length of 93 feet.
D. Temporary Termination of streets intended to be extended at a later
date shall be accomplished with the construction of a temporary "T"-
shaped turnabout contained within the street right-of-way subject to
review and approval by the Village Engineer.
E. Bicycle and Pedestrian Ways with a right-of-way width of not less than
12 feet may be required where deemed necessary by the Plan
Commission to provide adequate bicycle and pedestrian circulation or
§ 495-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-52
1:409
access to schools, shopping centers, churches, or transportation
facilities. Bicycle and pedestrian ways in wooded and wetland areas
shall be so designed and constructed as to minimize the removal of
trees, shrubs, and other vegetation, and to preserve the natural beauty
of the area.
F. Grades.
(1) Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to
avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover
and tree growth, and general leveling of the topography. All
changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a
minimum length equivalent in feet to 30 times the algebraic
difference in the rates of grade for arterial streets, and one-half this
minimum for all other streets.

NOTES:
a The thirty-two-foot pavement width is suggested only for use
with land access streets serving relatively low density, singlefamily
residential areas. For land access streets serving higher
density single- and multifamily residential, commercial, and
industrial areas, a minimum width of 36 feet should be
provided.
b A fifty-foot right-of-way and twenty-eight-foot pavement width
for land access streets would be applicable on relatively short
loop and cul-de-sac streets in areas of single-family homes with
attached garages and driveways, with adequate area available
on each lot for off-street parking and snow storage, and where
no bus or truck traffic other than occasional school buses and
service or delivery trucks would be expected to operate over the
street.
c Sidewalks may be eliminated on one side of minor land access
streets at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
d The center island should be tapered with a face-of-curb radius
of 37 feet at its widest end, a face-of-curb radius of 20 feet at its
narrowest end, and a length of 100 feet.

NOTES:
a Shoulders may be paved or gravel.
b The Plan Commission may require sidewalks to be provided on
one or both sides of any street, if the Commission determines
that sidewalks will be needed to accommodate anticipated
pedestrian traffic. Such sidewalks shall be located at the
outside edge of the terrace/drainage swale, with a one-foot
wide buffer between the sidewalk and outside edge of the
street right-of-way, unless otherwise directed by the Plan
Commission upon the recommendation of the Village Engineer.
c The center island should be tapered with a face-of-curb radius
of 35 feet at its widest end, a face-of-curb radius of 20 feet at
its narrowest end, and a length of 93 feet.
d Recommended right-of-way width for combined bicycle and
pedestrian ways separate from street rights-of-way.
(2) Unless necessitated by exceptional topography, subject to the
approval of the Plan Commission, the maximum center line grade of
any street or public way shall not exceed the following:
(a) Arterial streets: 6%.
(b) Collector streets: 8%.
(c) Land access streets, alleys and frontage streets: 10%.
(d) Bicycle ways: 5%; however, steeper grades are acceptable for
distances up to 500 feet.
(e) Pedestrian ways: 12%. Steps or stairs shall be provided if the
grade will exceed 12%.
(3) The grade of any street shall in no case exceed 10% or be less than
1/2 of 1% for streets with an urban cross-section, and 1% for
streets with a rural cross section.
G. Crowns. Unless otherwise approved, roadway pavements shall be
designed with a center line crown. Offset crowns or continuous crossslopes
may be utilized upon approval of the Village Engineer. Alley
pavements shall be "V"-shaped, with a center line gutter for drainage.
H. Radii of curvature.
(1) When a continuous street center line deflects at any one point by
more than 10°, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius
of curvature on said center line of not less than the following:
(a) Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet.
(b) Collector streets: 300 feet.
§ 495-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-52
1:413
§ 495-53. Street intersections.
(c) Land access streets: 100 feet.
(2) A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
I. Elevations of Arterial Streets shall be set so that they will not be
overtopped by a fifty-year recurrence interval flood.
J. Bridges and culverts. All new and replacement bridges and culverts
over navigable waterways, including pedestrian and other minor
bridges, shall be designed so as to accommodate the peak rate of
discharge of a one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood event
without raising the peak stage, either upstream or downstream, more
than 0.01 foot above the peak stage for the one-hundred-year
recurrence interval flood, as established by the Southeastern Wisconsin
Regional Planning Commission or the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. Larger permissible flood stage increases may be acceptable for
reaches having topographic or land use conditions which could
accommodate the increased stages without creating additional flood
damage potential upstream or downstream of the proposed structure,
providing that flood easements or other appropriate legal measures
have been secured from all property owners affected by the excess
stage increases. Such bridges and culverts shall be so designed and
constructed as to facilitate the passage of ice flows and other debris.
K. Half-streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half-street is
adjacent to the proposed land division or condominium plat, the other
half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of
new half-streets shall not be permitted.
A. Right angle. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles
as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
B. The Maximum Number of streets converging at one intersection shall
not exceed two.
C. The Number of Intersections along arterial streets and highways shall
be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, the distance between
such intersections shall not be less than 1,200 feet.
D. Continuation of land access and collector streets. Land access and
collector streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial streets;
but if the center lines of such streets approach the arterial streets from
opposite sides within 300 feet of each other, measured along the center
line of the arterial or collector streets, then the location of the collector
and/or land access streets shall be so adjusted so that a single
intersection is formed.
E. Corner curves. Property lines at intersections of arterial streets and at
intersections of collector and arterial streets shall be rounded to an arc
§ 495-52 SLINGER CODE § 495-53
1:414
§ 495-54. Blocks.
§ 495-55. Lots.
with a minimum radius of 15 feet, or a greater radius if required by the
Village Engineer.
F. Vision Clearance Easements shall be provided at street intersections as
may be required by the Village zoning ordinance and by any approving
or objecting authority concerned.
A. General requirements. The widths, lengths, and shapes of blocks shall
be suited to the planned use of the land; zoning requirements; the need
for convenient bicycle, pedestrian, and motor vehicle access; traffic
safety; and the limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. The Length of Blocks in residential areas shall not as a general rule be
less than 600 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in length unless otherwise
dictated by exceptional topography or other limiting factors of good
design.
C. The Width of Blocks shall be sufficient to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate
residential development from arterial streets and railroad rights-of-way.
The width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and
loading required by the contemplated use and the Village zoning
ordinance.
A. General requirements. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be
appropriate for the location of the land division and for the type of
development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to
provide an aesthetically pleasing building site, and a proper
architectural setting for the buildings contemplated. Lot lines shall
follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them.
B. Side Lot Lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to
curved street lines on which the lots face, unless a non-conventional lot
layout is approved by the Plan Commission.
C. Double Frontage Lots shall be prohibited except where necessary to
provide separation of residential development from arterial streets or
to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
D. Public street frontage. Every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at
least 40 feet on a public street.
E. The area and dimensions of lots, parcels or condominium parcels.
(1) Lots within the Village. The area and dimensions shall conform to
the requirements of the Village's Zoning Code.
§ 495-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-55
1:415
(2) Lots, parcels or condominium parcels in the Village's
extraterritorial plat review area. All lots or parcels, including
condominium ownership parcels, created in the aforementioned
area shall be a minimum of 35 acres in size to preserve such areas
for reasons described in the Village's Comprehensive Plan.
(3) Approval of lots, parcels or condominium parcels less than 35 acres
in size in the Village's extraterritorial plat review area. The Village
Planning Commission may consider and recommend, and the
Village Board may approve the creation of lots, parcels, or
condominium ownership parcels less than 35 acres in size in the
aforementioned area, provided the Village finds that the following
applicable criteria are met:
(a) Prior approval. The land division must be approved
conceptually by the Town's Planning Commission before its
submittal to the Village.
(b) Public entity benefit. If applicable, the land division is created
by or for a county, city, village, town, school district, or agency
of the state, and is specifically for a public purpose.
(c) Open space preservation. If applicable, the land division
results in the preservation of permanent open space lands for
public or for private use.
(d) Agricultural land divisions. If applicable, the land division will
assist and assure the continued agricultural use of the whole
property.
(e) Non-agricultural or residential subdivisions or land divisions.
[1] The created parcels are located outside the Village's
planned Sanitary Sewer Service Area.
[2] The resulting development would be compatible with the
Village's Comprehensive Plan.
[3] The resulting development would be compatible with
nearby land uses. Measures of compatibility include basic
use, lot sizes, traffic generation, access, noise and visual
appearance.
[4] The resulting development would not adversely affect the
Village's ability to provide current or future public
services, or install public improvements, or accomplish
future annexations. The Village may consider annexation
agreements with property owner(s) to meet this criteria.
[5] If commercial, industrial or institutional use is proposed,
the land division would allow infill between or adjacent to
already existing commercial, industrial or institutional
use(s).
§ 495-55 SLINGER CODE § 495-55
1:416
[6] If mineral extraction is proposed, the land division would
meet criteria described in the Village's Comprehensive
Plan Report.
(f) Possible conditions. The Village may require conditions in
conjunction with its approval authority as described herein.
F. Re-division of lots. Wherever a lot, parcel, or tract is subdivided into
lots or parcels that are more than twice the minimum lot area required
in the zoning district in which the lot or parcel is located, the Plan
Commission may require that such lots or parcels be arranged and
dimensioned to allow re-division into smaller lots or parcels that will
meet the provisions of this Ordinance and the zoning ordinance.
G. Depth. Lots shall have a minimum average depth of 125 feet. Excessive
depth in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of two to
one shall be considered a desirable ratio, unless a deeper lot is needed
to protect natural resources. The depth of lots or parcels reserved or
laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide
for off-street parking and loading areas required by the contemplated
use and the Village zoning ordinance.
H. The Width of Lots shall conform to the requirements of the Village
Zoning Ordinance, and in no case shall a lot be less than 75 feet in
width at the building setback line, unless otherwise provided by the
Village zoning ordinance.
I. Corner Lots, when located in a district that permits a lot width less than
100 feet, shall have an extra width of 15 feet to permit adequate
building setbacks from side streets.
J. The Shape of lots shall be approximately rectangular, with the
exception of lots located on a curved street or on a cul-de-sac
turnabout. Flag lots shall be prohibited, except where necessary to
accommodate exceptional topography or to preserve natural resources
or to allow for shared driveways.
K. Lands Lying Between the Meander Line and the Water's Edge and any
otherwise unplattable lands which lie between a proposed land division
or condominium and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots,
outlots, or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream.
L. Restrictions prohibiting development. Whenever a lot appearing on a
final plat, condominium plat, or certified survey map is not intended to
be buildable, or is intended to be buildable only upon certain
conditions, an express restriction to that effect, running with the land
and enforceable by the Village, shall appear on the face of the plat or
map.
M. Basement elevations on proposed building sites affected by high
groundwater.
§ 495-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-55
1:417
§ 495-56. Building and setback lines.
Building setback lines appropriate to the location and type of development
contemplated, which are more restrictive than required in the applicable
zoning district, may be permitted or required by the Plan Commission and
(1) Any person proposing to create new building sites shall perform a
detailed soil profile evaluation and satisfactorily demonstrate to the
Village Engineer that any structures with a basement will be
constructed to minimize risks from high groundwater where any of
the following conditions exist:
(a) In areas with soils classified by the Natural Resource
Conservation Service (NRCS) as hydric, poorly drained,
somewhat poorly drained or very poorly drained.
(b) Within eight vertical feet adjacent to soils classified by NRCS
as hydric or poorly drained, wetlands or other surface water
features such as lakes, streams, ponds, etc.
(c) Within areas where other soil investigations show indicators of
seasonal high water tables.
(d) Within other areas the Village Engineer determines to be at
risk of high groundwater based on site topography, drainage
patterns, observed hillside seeps or other indicators.
(2) All soil profile evaluations shall be performed in accordance with
Chapter SPS 385, Wisconsin Administrative Code. A minimum of
one soil profile evaluation shall be conducted within 50 feet of each
proposed basement meeting one or more of the criteria above.
Determinations of seasonal high water table elevations shall be
made in written interpretive report and signed and stamped by a
certified soil tester or professional soil scientist registered in the
State of Wisconsin. All submittals to the Village Engineer shall
include all applicable soil profile evaluations.
(3) To minimize the risks from the presence of high groundwater,
recommended basement floor elevation data shall be included on
the face of the plat or CSM and recorded with the Register of Deeds
with the following statement:
"Basement floor surface elevation shall not be lower than (xxx.x)
due to the potential for seasonal high groundwater conditions."
N. Drain tiles and discharge of groundwater. The Village Engineer shall be
notified of any drain tiles that are uncovered during construction, which
the Village Engineer may require to be restored or connected to other
drainage systems. No discharge of groundwater from tile lines, sump
pumps or other means shall be allowed onto another person's land, road
right-of-way or other public space without the prior written approval of
the downstream landowner or the applicable unit of government.
§ 495-55 SLINGER CODE § 495-56
1:418
shall be shown on the final plat, condominium plat, or certified survey
map. Examples of the application of this provision would include requiring
greater setbacks on cul-de-sac lots to achieve the necessary lot width at the
setback line, requiring greater setbacks to conform to setbacks of existing
adjacent development, requiring greater setbacks to accommodate a coving
design, requiring greater setbacks to avoid placing buildings within
easements or vision clearance triangles, setting special yard requirements
to protect natural resources, or requiring greater setbacks along arterial
streets and highways to meet the requirements of Chapter Trans 233 of the
Wisconsin Administrative Code.
§ 495-57. Easements.
§ 495-58. Protection of natural resources.
Where natural drainage channels, floodplains, wetlands, or other
environmentally sensitive areas are encompassed in whole or in part within
a proposed land division or condominium, the Plan Commission may require
A. Utility easements. The Plan Commission may require utility easements
of widths deemed adequate for the intended purpose. Such easements
shall be located as determined by the applicable utility company, but
preferably should be located along rear and side lot lines and should be
designed to avoid the location of such facilities as electric power
transformers in the flow lines of drainage swales and ditches. All lines,
pipes, cables and similar equipment shall be installed underground
unless the Plan Commission finds that the topography, soils, depth to
bedrock, woodlands, wetlands, or other physical barriers would make
underground installation impractical, or that the lots to be served by
said facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities
and requiring underground installation would constitute an undue
hardship upon the subdivider. Associated equipment and facilities
which are appurtenant to underground electric power,

§ 526-1. Authority.
This chapter is adopted by the Village of Slinger Village Board under
the authority granted by §§ 61.354, 92.07(15), 281.33 and Ch. 236, Wis.
Stats. This chapter supersedes all conflicting and contradictory regulations
previously enacted by the Village of Slinger relating to stormwater
management and construction site erosion control. The requirements of
this chapter do not preempt more stringent erosion and sediment control
requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
§ 526-2. Findings.
The Village Board finds that construction site erosion and uncontrolled
stormwater runoff from land disturbing and land development activities
have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health,
safety and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public
enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, soil erosion and
stormwater runoff can:
A. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals, including those authorized under §§ 281.16 and
283.33, Wis. Stats.
B. Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated under
rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under § NR
151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
A. Carry a significant amount of sediment, nutrients, bacteria/other
pathogens, organic matter, toxins and other pollutants to local lakes,
streams and wetlands;
B. Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and
water supply uses, and a natural diversity of plant and animal life;
C. Clog drainage systems with sediment, and organic material, which in
turn increases maintenance costs;
D. Overwhelm existing drainageways with increased flows, causing bank
and channel erosion, and increasing downstream flooding and property
damage;
§ 495-97 SLINGER CODE § 526-2
1:446
§ 526-3. Purpose and intent.
§ 526-4. Jurisdiction.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdictional boundaries of the Village of Slinger.
§ 526-5. Applicability, exemptions and waivers.
E. Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows
and/or lower water levels in local lakes, ponds and wetlands;
F. Contaminate drinking water supplies;
G. Generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health
threatening or may cause other off-site damage to property or the
environment; and
H. Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence
and levels of flooding.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth requirements for
land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize
sedimentation, water pollution, flooding and related property and
environmental damage caused by soil erosion and uncontrolled
stormwater runoff during and after construction, in order to diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the natural resources
of the Village of Slinger.
B. Intent. It is the general intent of this chapter to regulate construction
site erosion and stormwater management under the authority granted
in § 61.354, Wis. Stats. This chapter is not intended to limit activity or
land divisions permitted under the applicable zoning and land division
ordinances.
C. Regional stormwater management. The Village Board recognizes that
the preferred method of permanently managing stormwater runoff from
land development activities is through the preparation and
implementation of regional stormwater management plans by
watershed areas which are designed to meet the requirements of this
chapter. Accordingly, provisions have been incorporated into this
chapter to allow for the implementation of this type of plan in lieu of
complying with certain on-site stormwater management requirements.
A. Construction site erosion control. Unless otherwise exempted under
Subsection C below, or waived under Subsection D below, an erosion
and runoff control permit under § 526-6 of this chapter shall be
required, and all construction site erosion control provisions of this
chapter shall apply to all land disturbing activity that meet any of the
following:
(1) Disturbs 4,000 square feet or more of total land surface area;
§ 526-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-5
1:447
(2) Involves excavation or filling, or a combination of excavation and
filling, in excess of 400 cubic yards of material;
(3) Disturbs 100 lineal feet of road ditch, grass waterway or other land
area where surface drainage flows in a defined open channel;
including the placement, repair or removal of any underground
pipe, utility or other facility within the cross-section of the channel
at flow capacity;
(4) Involves the laying, repairing, replacing, or enlarging of an
underground utility, pipe or other facility, or the disturbance of
road ditch, grass swale or other open channel for a distance of 300
feet or more;
(5) Involves the maintenance of an existing stormwater best
management practice (BMP);
(6) Other land disturbing activities, including the installation of access
drives, that the Village Engineer determines to have a high risk of
soil erosion or water pollution, or that may significantly impact an
environmentally sensitive area. All determinations made by the
Village Engineer under this subsection shall be made in written
form, unless otherwise waived in writing by the requesting entity.
B. Stormwater management. Unless otherwise exempted under
Subsection C below, or waived under Subsection D below, an erosion
and runoff control permit under § 526-6 below, shall be required, and all
stormwater management provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
land development activity that meet any of the following:
(1) The project is located within a subdivision plat or is part of a
subdivision plat.
(2) Involves the construction of any new public or private roads or
access drives of any length;
(3) Is a certified survey map or any other land development activity
that may ultimately result in the addition of impervious surfaces of
20,000 square feet or greater in total area or may result in land
disturbing activity of one acre or greater, including smaller
individual sites that are part of a common plan of development; or
(4) Other land development activities, including access drives, that the
Village Engineer determines may significantly increase
downstream runoff volumes, flooding, soil erosion, water pollution
or property damage, or significantly impact an environmentally
sensitive area. All determinations made by the Village Engineer
under this subsection shall be made in written or electronic form,
unless otherwise waived in writing by the requesting entity.
C. Exemptions.

§ 526-8. Erosion control plan requirements.
(4) If all of the applicable requirements of this chapter have been met,
the Village Engineer will provide a preliminary plan approval letter
or an erosion and runoff control permit. If the requirements of this
chapter have not been met, the Village Engineer will notify the
applicant what changes would be necessary to meet the
requirements.
A. General requirements.
(1) An erosion control plan shall ensure, to the extent practical, that
soil erosion, siltation, sedimentation and other off-site impacts from
land disturbing activities are minimized.
(2) All erosion control plans shall by design, achieve to the maximum
extent practicable, a runoff discharge of no more than five tons of
sediment per acre per year from sheet and rill erosion during land
disturbing activities as compared with no sediment or erosion
controls, until the site is stabilized. This shall be completed by the
landowner, landowner's engineer, or other responsible party
designated by the landowner in conformance with the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources Construction Site Soil Loss and
Sediment Discharge Guidance.
(3) All erosion control plans and best management practice designs
prepared under this chapter shall comply with the plan
requirements of this section and the technical standards and
specifications described in § 526-10 of this chapter.
B. Guiding principles. To satisfy the requirements of this section, all
proposed land disturbing activities shall, to the extent practical:
(1) Be planned and implemented in a manner that best fits the terrain
of the site, avoiding steep slopes and other environmentally
sensitive areas;
(2) Minimize the loss of trees and other natural vegetation and the size
of the disturbed area;
(3) Minimize, through project phasing and proper construction
sequencing, the time the disturbed soil surface is exposed [Note:
See § 526-11B(3) of this chapter for special conditions relating to
construction scheduling and the issuance of a permit.];
(4) Emphasize the use of erosion control measures that prevent soil
detachment and erosion rather than trying to intercept its
transport or repair damage done.
C. Specific erosion control requirements. Unless otherwise waived under
§ 526-5D of this chapter, the following minimum requirements shall be
met on all sites subject to the applicability criteria under § 526-5A of
§ 526-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-8
1:453
this chapter and shall be addressed in the erosion control plan
submitted by the applicant, if applicable. The Village Engineer is
authorized to exceed the minimum requirements stated below for any
site that the Village Engineer determines is a high risk of soil erosion
or may significantly impact an environmentally sensitive area, and that
further controls are practical.
(1) Access drives and tracking. Each site shall provide an access
drive(s) and parking area, of sufficient dimensions and design,
surfaced with a material that will prevent erosion and minimize
tracking or washing of soil onto public or private roadways. All
nonpaved access drives shall be designed so that stormwater runoff
from adjacent areas does not flow down the drive surface. Culverts
shall be sized for calculated peak flows produced by the ten-year,
twenty-four-hour design storm and shall meet all other state and
local requirements relating to road access.
(2) Diversion of upslope runoff. Any significant amount of runoff from
upslope land area, rooftops or other surfaces that drains across the
proposed land disturbance shall be diverted around the disturbed
area, if practical. Any diversion of upslope runoff shall be done in a
manner that prevents erosion of the flow path and the outlet.
(3) Cut and fill slopes. Any cuts and fills shall be planned and
constructed to minimize the length and steepness of slope, and
stabilized in accordance with the approved erosion control plan
time lines and technical standards of this chapter.
(4) Open channels. Any open channels shall be designed and
constructed to carry the calculated peak flows for a ten-year,
twenty-four-hour design storm, and stabilized in accordance with
the approved erosion control plan timelines and technical
standards of this chapter.
(5) Inlet protection. All inlets to storm drains, culverts and other
stormwater conveyance systems shall be protected from siltation
until final site stabilization.
(6) Outlet protection. All outlets for site dewatering and stormwater
conveyance systems, including pipe or open channels entering a
stormwater management facility, shall be protected from erosion
through channel lining or other stabilization measures.
(7) Site erosion control. Measures shall be taken, using approved best
management practices (BMPs), to minimize sediment from being
carried off-site by water or wind during the construction phase,
such as: diversions, silt fence, straw bales, downspout extenders,
soil treatment, temporary mulch, sediment traps, sediment basins,
etc. All temporary best management practices shall be maintained
until the site is stabilized. Some best management practices, such
as sediment basins, may be designed to also serve as a permanent
stormwater best management practice after the site is stabilized.
§ 526-8 SLINGER CODE § 526-8
1:454
(8) Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
sediment basins or other approved measures to prevent soil
erosion and water pollution.
(9) Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building
materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater,
toxic materials, or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed
of and not allowed to be carried off-site by runoff or wind.
(10) Topsoil. Enough topsoil from the disturbed area must be saved to
ensure that a minimum of four inches to six inches is reapplied for
all areas to be seeded or sodded. If adequate topsoil does not exist
on the site to meet this requirement, it shall be imported. If the
disturbed area is to be used for the growing of agricultural crops in
the future, the original depth of topsoil shall be restored.
(11) Subsoil. For disturbed areas that are to be used for the growing of
agricultural crops, trees or other woody vegetation in the future, a
minimum of one foot of original subsoil shall remain or be reapplied
prior to the application of topsoil to provide an adequate root zone.
(12) Soil stockpiles. Soil stockpiles shall be located no closer than 75
feet from lakes, streams, wetlands, ditches, drainageways, curbs/
gutters or other stormwater conveyance system, unless otherwise
approved by the Village Engineer. Any soil stockpile that remains
for more than seven days shall be covered or treated with
stabilization practices such as temporary or permanent seeding
and mulching.
(13) Sediment cleanup. All off-site sediment deposits occurring as a
result of construction work or a storm event shall be cleaned up by
the end of each day of the occurrence. Flushing shall not be
allowed.
(14) Final site stabilization. All disturbed areas shall be treated with
stabilization measures such as seeding, mulching, soil treatment,
erosion netting, matting, sodding, etc. within three working days of
final grading. Sites greater than 10 acres shall be treated in stages
as final grading is completed in equal increments. Any soil erosion
that occurs after final grading and/or the application of
stabilization measures must be repaired and the stabilization work
redone.
(15) Temporary site stabilization. For any disturbed area that remains
inactive for greater than seven working days, or where grading
work extends beyond September 15, the permanent seeding
deadline established by the Village Board, the administering
authority may require the site to be treated with temporary
stabilization measures such as soil treatment, temporary seeding
and/or mulching in addition to other erosion control measures as
part of an approved erosion control plan.
§ 526-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-8
1:455
(16) Removal of practices. When the disturbed area has been stabilized
by permanent vegetation or other means, temporary best
management practices such as silt fences, straw bales and
sediment traps shall be removed and these areas shall be
stabilized.
(17) Stormwater BMP data. When a stormwater permit involves the
maintenance of an existing stormwater BMP, including the removal
of accumulated sediment, the Village Engineer may require
additional support data such as before/after surveys, design and
construction details, and oversight by a professional engineer
licensed in Wisconsin.
D. Final erosion control plan contents.

with the exception of Subsection D(2)(b)[2], [6], and [7] above, the
supporting documentation in Subsection D(2)(b)[5] above, and the
starting and completion dates in Subsection D(2)(b)[5] above.
A. General requirements.
(1) A stormwater management plan, prepared in accordance with this
chapter, shall maintain the site's natural drainage patterns and
predevelopment peak flows. In addition, measures shall be taken to
prevent or minimize the pollution of surface waters and
groundwater resources, damage to downstream property and local
flooding as a result of stormwater discharges from the proposed
land development.
(2) All stormwater management plans and best management practice
designs prepared under this chapter shall comply with the plan
requirements of this section and technical standards and
specifications described in § 526-10 of this chapter.
B. Exception: regional stormwater management plans.
(1) In lieu of submitting a preliminary or final stormwater management
plan for an individual site, an applicant may submit documentation
of the following:
§ 526-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-9
1:459
(a) A regional stormwater management plan, that:
[1] Includes the entire area of the proposed land development
activity;
[2] Is prepared in accordance with the general requirements
of Subsection A above and the regional stormwater
management planning technical guidelines adopted by the
Village Board under § 526-10C of this chapter; and
[3] Is approved by the Village Board and all other applicable
units of government included in the planning area.
(b) A site development plan, in accordance with Subsection E(2)
below, for the planned development showing any on-site
stormwater best management practices recommended in the
regional stormwater management plan;
(c) Certification, by a professional engineer registered in the State
of Wisconsin, that any stormwater best management
practice(s) planned to treat the runoff from the area of the
proposed land development as part of a regional stormwater
management plan, has been constructed in accordance with
the technical standards and specifications under § 526-10 of
this chapter, if applicable; and
(d) Documentation that there is an entity with the legal obligation
for operation and maintenance of any applicable stormwater
management facility in accordance with § 526-12 of this
chapter, if applicable.
(2) Upon certification by the Village Engineer that all of the conditions
of Subsection B(1)(a) above have been met, and the submitted
materials are in compliance with the regional stormwater
management plan, an application shall be deemed as meeting the
stormwater management planning requirements of this chapter.
(3) As a condition of an erosion and runoff control permit, the applicant
may be required to pay a fee or meet other requirements, as
determined by the applicable entity charged with the
implementation of the regional stormwater management plan. Any
fee would be based on an equitable distribution of the cost for land,
engineering design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater
management practices needed to serve the land development
through the regional stormwater management plan.
C. Guiding principles. To satisfy the requirements of this chapter, unless
otherwise waived under § 526-5D of this chapter, all proposed land
development activities shall, to the extent practical:
§ 526-9 SLINGER CODE § 526-9
1:460
(1) Be planned and implemented in a manner that best fits the terrain
of the site, avoiding steep slopes and other environmentally
sensitive areas;
(2) Preserve natural watershed boundaries and drainage patterns;
(3) Maintain groundwater recharge areas and the infiltration capacity
of native soils by avoiding the unnecessary filling of large natural
depressions or compaction of upper soil horizons by construction
equipment;
(4) Utilize natural or constructed vegetated swales or reinforced
permeable open channels for stormwater conveyance and
attenuation;
(5) Minimize impervious surfaces and have them drain to vegetated
areas for flow attenuation, pollutant filtering and groundwater
recharge; and
(6) Reserve adequately sized areas to allow for detention of flows and
treatment of pollutants from stormwater before being discharged
from the site.
D. Specific stormwater management requirements and performance
standards. Except where provided for under Subsection B above, or
waived under § 526-5D of this chapter, all land development activities
subject to the provisions of this subsection shall provide on-site
stormwater management plans, practices and facilities that meet the
following minimum requirements:
(1) Peak flows. The peak flow rates of stormwater runoff from a
development shall not exceed the predevelopment storm runoff
calculated for a series of design storms that at a minimum include
the one-, two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year rainfall events.
(2) Stormwater quality. The first 1/2 inch of stormwater runoff
(commonly referred to as the "first flush") shall, to the extent
practical, be treated to remove suspended solids, nutrients, organic
matter, trace metals, hydrocarbons and other pollutants associated
with the planned land development activity.
(a) By design, each stormwater management plan shall meet the
following post-development total suspended solids reduction
targets, based on average annual rainfalls, as compared to no
runoff management controls;
[1] For new land development and in-fill development, 80%
reduction in total suspended solids;
[2] For redevelopment, 40% reduction of total suspended
solids load from parking areas and roads;
§ 526-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-9
1:461
[3] The Village Engineer may require a higher level of controls
if the Village Engineer determines that the site has a high
risk of water pollution or may otherwise impact an
environmentally sensitive area, and that further controls
are practical.
(b) When designing best management practices, runoff draining to
the best management practice from off-site shall be taken into
account in determining the treatment efficiency of the
practice. Any impact on the efficiency shall be compensated for
by increasing the size of the best management practice
accordingly.
(c) Pollutant loading data for phosphorus shall also be included.
All major assumptions used in developing input parameters
shall be clearly stated. The geographic areas used in making
the calculations shall be clearly cross-referenced to the
required map(s).
(3) Infiltration.
(a) Best management practices. BMPs shall be designed, installed,
and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the
following or to the maximum extent practicable:
[1] Low imperviousness. For development up to 40%
connected imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and
low-density residential development, infiltrate sufficient
runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration
volume shall be at least 90% of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems
to meet this requirement, no more than 1% of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective infiltration
area.
[2] Moderate imperviousness. For development with more
than 40% and up to 80% connected imperviousness, such
as medium- and high-density residential, multifamily
development, industrial and institutional development,
and office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that
the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least
75% of the predevelopment infiltration volume, based on
an average annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 2% of the post-construction site is required
as an effective infiltration area.
[3] High imperviousness. For development with more than
80% connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip
malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns,
infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-
§ 526-9 SLINGER CODE § 526-9
1:462
development infiltration volume shall be at least 60% of
the predevelopment infiltration volume, based on an
average annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 2% of the post-construction site is required
as an effective infiltration area.
(b) Pretreatment. Before infiltration runoff, pretreatment shall be
required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road
construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas
that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be
designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior
to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality
in accordance with Subsection D(7). Pretreatment options may
include, but are not limited to, oil and grease separation,
sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips.
NOTE: To achieve the infiltration requirement for the parking
lots or roads, "maximum extent practicable" should not be
interpreted to require significant topography changes that
create an excessive financial burden. To minimize potential
groundwater impacts, it is desirable to infiltrate the cleanest
runoff. To achieve this, a design may propose greater
infiltration of runoff from low pollutant sources such as roofs,
and less from higher pollutant source areas such as parking
lots.
(c) Infiltration prohibitions. Due to potential for groundwater
contamination, runoff shall not be infiltrated and will not be
credited toward meeting the requirements of this subsection
for the following:
[1] Runoff from outdoor material storage and loading docks
for tier 1 and tier 2 industrial facilities, as identified in
§ NR 216(2), Wis. Adm. Code. Parking lot runoff from tier 1
industrial facilities is prohibited. Parking lot runoff from
tier 2 facilities may be infiltrated, but may require
pretreatment.
[2] Runoff from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas, not
including rooftops and canopies.
[3] Infiltration of runoff within 1,000 feet upgradient or within
100 feet downgradient of karst features.
[4] Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as
specified in Ch. NR 811, Wis. Adm. Code, or within 100
feet of a private well as specified in Ch. NR 812, Wis. Adm.
Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial
and institutional land uses or regional devices for
residential development, not including rooftop runoff.
§ 526-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-9
1:463
[5] Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in Ch.
NR 720, Wis. Adm. Code, are present in the soil through
which infiltration will occur.
(d) Separation distances. Infiltration BMPs shall be located so the
characteristics of the soil and the separation distance between
the bottom of the infiltration BMP and the elevation of the
highest groundwater table or the top of bedrock are in
accordance with the following:
Source Area
Groundwater or
Bedrock
Separation

Not applicable Not applicable
All other impervious
source areas
3 feet or more Filtering layer
(e) Infiltration exemptions. Infiltration practices located in the
following areas may be credited toward meeting the
requirements under the following conditions, but the decision
to infiltrate under these conditions is optional:
[1] Where the infiltration rate of the soil measured at the
proposed bottom of the infiltration system is less than 0.6
inch per hour using a scientifically credible field test
method.
[2] Where the least permeable soil horizon to five feet below
the proposed bottom of the infiltration system using the
U.S. Department of Agriculture method of soils analysis is
one of the following: sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay
loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.
(4) Protective areas.
§ 526-9 SLINGER CODE § 526-9
1:464
(a) An area of land that commences at the top of the channel of
lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of
wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as
measured horizontally from the top of the channel or
delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface.
However, in this section, "protective area" does not include any
area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or
culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this
location. The minimum protective area widths are as follows:
[1] For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource
waters, 75 feet.
[2] For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a U.S.
Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a
county soil survey map, whichever is more current, 50
feet.
[3] For lakes, 50 feet.
[4] For wetlands not subject to Subsection D(4)(a)[5] or [6], 50
feet.
[5] For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly
susceptible wetlands include the following types:
calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open and coniferous
bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood
swamps, and ephemeral ponds.
[6] For less susceptible wetlands, 10% of the average wetland
width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet. Less
susceptible wetlands include: degraded wetland
dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass;
cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged
material or fill material disposal sites that take on the
attributes of a wetland.
[7] In Subsection D(4)(a)[4] through [6], determinations of the
extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be
made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff
susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the
standards and criteria in § NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
[8] Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance
with § NR 103.08(1m), Wis. Adm. Code. This subsection
does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled
in compliance with all applicable state and federal
regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have
been partially filled in compliance with all applicable state
and federal regulations shall be measured from the
wetland boundary delineation after a fill has been placed.
§ 526-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-9
1:465
Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the
protective area standard need not be met in that location.
[9] For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas
greater than 130 acres, 10 feet.
[10] Notwithstanding Subsection D(4)(a)[1] to [9], the greatest
protective area width shall apply where rivers, streams,
lakes and wetlands are contiguous.
[11] Minimum horizontal and vertical setbacks from the lowest
opening of the principal structure shall follow § 526-10F.
(b) Requirements. The following requirements shall be met for all
land development activity located within a protective area:
[1] Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective
area entirely or to the maximum extent practicable. If
there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious
surface in the protective area, the stormwater
management plan shall contain a written, site-specific
explanation.
[2] Where land-disturbing activity occurs within a protective
area, and where no impervious surface is present,
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70% or
greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate
sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to
provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and
filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas
under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative materials,
such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as
necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or
where high velocity flows occur.
NOTE: It is recommended that seeding of nonaggressive
vegetative cover be used in the protective areas.
Vegetation that is flood- and drought-tolerant and can
provide long-term bank stability because an extensive root
system is preferable.
[3] Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or
wet detention basins that are designed to control
pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the
protective area, but shall not encroach into wetlands,
floodplains, woodlands, isolated natural resource areas, or
primary or secondary environmental corridors to the
maximum extent practicable.
NOTE: Other regulations, such as Ch. 30, Wis. Stats., and
Chs. NR 103, 115, 116 and 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and their
§ 526-9 SLINGER CODE § 526-9
1:466
associated review and approval process, may apply in the
protective area.
(c) Protective area exemptions. The protective area requirements
do not apply to any of the following:
[1] Structures that cross or access surface waters such as
boat landings, bridges and culverts;
[2] Structures constructed in accordance with § 59.692(1v),
Wis. Stats.; and
[3] Sites where runoff does not enter the surface water,
including wetlands, without first being treated by a BMP to
meet the total suspended solids requirements under
§ 526-9D(2) and peak discharge requirements under
§ 526-9D(1), except to the extent that vegetative ground
cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
(5) Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle
maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and
maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff
that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen.
NOTE: A combination of the following BMPs may be used: oil and
grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup materials, or
any other structural or non-structural method of preventing or
treating petroleum in runoff.
(6) Protection of wetlands. Stormwater discharges shall minimize the
hydrologic changes and pollutant loadings to wetlands, to the
extent practical, in order to preserve the wetland functional values.
All discharges to wetlands shall require the same protection as
Subsection D(1) and (2) above, unless otherwise approved by any
other applicable regulatory agency and the Village Engineer in
accordance with technical standards adopted under § 526-10 of
this chapter. If any land disturbing activity is proposed in a wetland
as part of a final stormwater management plan, the Village
Engineer will require all other applicable permits to be obtained
prior to the issuance of an erosion and runoff control permit.
(7) Protection of groundwater quality.
(a) Stormwater discharges shall prevent the introduction of
pollutants in the groundwater at concentrations that will likely
exceed groundwater preventive action limits or enforcement
standards established by the Department of Natural Resources
in Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code. Pretreatment shall be provided
for all stormwater management facilities that will likely violate
this subsection, as determined by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources or stated in the technical standards adopted
under § 526-10 of this chapter.
§ 526-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-9
1:467
(b) Stormwater structures shall not be installed that meet the
definition of an injection well under § NR 812.05, Wis. Adm.
Code.
(c) If a wellhead protection plan has been approved for any area
included in the proposed land development, the administering
authority shall consult with the appropriate authority to ensure
compliance with any recommendations or regulations
contained in that plan.
(8) Flooding. All stormwater management facilities shall have a twofoot
freeboard between one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design
storm and emergency spillway and the capacity to safely handle the
calculated peak flow rates for a one-hundred-year, twenty-fourhour
design storm without structural failure, bank erosion, loss of
freeboard or other problems. At a minimum, an emergency spillway
must be provided to carry these flows and the overflow route
indicated on an exhibit within the stormwater management report.
Additional control measures, such as infiltration practices or
maintaining predevelopment peak flows for the one-hundred-year
design storm, may be required if the Village Engineer determines
that the proposed land development activity has a high risk of
creating or significantly compounding downstream flooding or
chronic wetness problems.
(9) Soil investigations. Soil profile investigations shall be conducted at
each site proposed for the construction of a stormwater
management facility. Each excavation shall extend a minimum of
three feet below the proposed bottom of the facility or any
component of the facility, such as infiltration trenches. An adequate
number of excavations shall be conducted to examine all soil types
present in the immediate area of the proposed facility, as
determined by the Village Engineer. Each soil investigation site
shall be located on the site development plan, under Subsection
E(2) below along with the elevation, to the nearest tenth of a foot,
of the original ground surface. A soil tester, certified in the State of
Wisconsin, or the Village Engineer is required to log the soil profile
and groundwater elevation(s). The Village Engineer may require an
inspection of the soil profile when it is logged by another party.
(10) Additional requirements. The administrating authority may
establish more stringent requirements than the minimums set forth
in this section, such as addressing thermal impacts of stormwater,
downstream flooding, a total maximum daily load (TMDL) standard
for a watershed including but not limited to phosphorus, bacteria,
chlorides, other applicable state or federal laws, an order of any
court of competent jurisdiction, or chronic wetness conditions, if
the administrating authority determines that and added level of
protection is needed.

F. Structure setback from stormwater management facilities or wetlands
to minimize flood damage. Flows generated by the one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour design storm under planned land use conditions may
exceed the design capacity of stormwater management facilities or
wetlands. The restrictions described herein are used solely for setbacks
determined by stormwater calculations and are not meant to
circumvent more restrictive setback requirements described elsewhere
in Chapter 550, Zoning. For principle structures, the following
minimum requirements shall apply:
(1) Vertical setback. The lowest elevation of the finished yard grade at
the principle structure shall be at least two feet above the
maximum water elevation of any stormwater management facility
or wetland for an event produced by the one-hundred-year, twentyfour-
hour design storm.
(2) Horizontal setback. A principle structure shall be located no closer
than 25 feet from the maximum water elevation produced by a onehundred-
year, twenty-four-hour design storm adjacent to any
stormwater facility or wetland.

extend beyond the shoreland zone.
SOIL DETACHMENT  The first step in the soil erosion process, or the
dislodging of the soil particle from raindrop impact, water flow or wind.
After detachment, the soil particle can be suspended and carried in runoff
or wind to another site. Soil detachment is reduced by providing a
vegetative or synthetic cover over the soil surface or through the
application of soil treatment measures designed for this purpose.
STABILIZED  That vegetation is well established or other surfacing
material is in place and the risk of further soil erosion is minimal.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT  Any measures taken to permanently
reduce or minimize the negative impacts of stormwater runoff quantity and

be discharged per day into a water quality limited segment and still ensure
attainment of the applicable water quality standard.
TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS LOAD  The total weight of material,
including sediment and other solids, that is assumed to be carried in the
runoff water and discharged from the site based on runoff models for
urban lands. For best management practice design purposes, a five-micron
particle size is usually selected as a target to achieve 80% total suspended
solids removal rate, as required in § 526-9D of this chapter.
WATERSHED  The total area of land where runoff drains to a specific
point on the landscape. It is also referred to as the "drainage area."
WETLAND FUNCTIONAL VALUES  The type, quality and significance of
the ecological and cultural benefits provided by the wetland, such as: flood
storage, water quality protection, groundwater recharge and discharge,
shoreline protection, fish and wildlife habitat, floral diversity, aesthetics,
recreation and education.
§ 526-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 526-16
1:485

(Reserved)
§ 550-39. Groundwater Protection Overlay District.
F. Floodplain ordinance. See Chapter 481, Floodplain Zoning, in this
Code.
A. Purpose and authority.
(1) The Village Board of the Village of Slinger recognizes that the
people of the Village of Slinger depend exclusively on groundwater
for a safe drinking water supply and that certain land uses in the
Village of Slinger environmental setting can seriously degrade
water quality. Therefore, the designated best use of the unconfined
groundwater of the Village of Slinger is for public and private water
supply and it is the policy of the Village to maintain its groundwater
resources as near to the natural condition of purity as reasonably
possible for the safeguarding of the public health, safety, and
welfare.
(2) The purpose of the Groundwater Protection Overlay District is to
protect key groundwater recharge areas by imposing appropriate
land-use restrictions in these areas. Wisconsin Act 410 of 1983,
specifically includes groundwater protection among the purposes
for which local zoning power may be exercised.297 The restrictions
included herein are in addition to those of the underlying zoning
districts or any other provisions of the zoning or other Village
ordinance.
B. Designation of municipal or private well field groundwater protection
zones.
(1) The boundaries for the groundwater recharge protection zones for
the groundwater Protection Overlay District are as shown on the
map "Groundwater Protection Districts for the Village of Slinger
Well Fields" dated February 24, 1993. (See Fig. A1 for examples of
proposed wellhead protection zones for Well Field #5.)298
(2) Said map is hereby adopted by reference becoming a part of this
chapter as if the map were fully described herein. The groundwater
recharge basins for the designated well fields are divided into three
zones reflecting the potential for land-use activities to adversely
impact the well fields and the subsequent scope of land-use
restrictions needed.
C. Zone A, Groundwater Protection Overlay District.
297. Editor's Note: See § 62.23(7)(c), Wis. Stats.
298. Editor's Note: The map and Fig. A1 are on file in the Village office.
§ 550-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-39
1:537
(1) Zone A is the immediate area around the well field, commonly
known as the "cone of depression," in which groundwater
elevations are lowered by pumping. This area is subject to the
highest contaminant threat, and therefore, the land use restrictions
are the most severe of the recharge zones.
(2) The following uses are permitted:
(a) Parks/playgrounds.
(b) Archery ranges.
(c) Boat landings.
(d) Other natural uses:
[1] Wildlife areas.
[2] Wild crops.
[3] Non-motor trails (bike, skiing, nature, fitness).
[4] Hunting/fishing/trapping with Village-issued permit.299
(3) The following uses are permitted upon proper application as
provided in this chapter, only after such use shall have been
approved in writing by the Planning Commission. Such approval
shall be consistent with the general purpose and intent of this
chapter and shall be based upon evidence as may be presented at
such public hearings, tending to show the desirability of specific
uses from the standpoint of the public interest because of such
factors as (without limitation because of enumeration)
groundwater pollution, smoke, dust, noxious or toxic gases and
odors, noise, glare, vibration, operation of heavy machinery, heavy
vehicular traffic, increased traffic on the streets and other safety
and health factors; such uses shall meet the specific conditions
attached below and such other conditions as the Planning
Commission deems necessary in furthering the purpose of this
chapter.
(4) The following use is expressly prohibited in this zone:
(a) All uses not permitted or special exception in this section.
(5) The following standards apply to all uses in Zone A of the
Groundwater Protection Overlay District:
(a) On-site sanitary system with any type of discharge, on lots less
than 40,000 square feet.
(b) Underground tanks are prohibited.

II).
§ 550-39 SLINGER CODE § 550-39
1:538
(c) Natural vegetation not treated with fertilizers and pesticides. A
minimum of 85% of lot must be retained in natural vegetation.
(d) Lot size: 40,000 square feet per residential unit. Multiplefamily
units and cluster developments may increase density by
50% if restrictive covenant maintains natural vegetation
requirement.
(e) Pesticide/fertilizer storage and use (including septage and
sludge landspreading) are prohibited except for normal home
use and by special case-by-case review.
(f) Animal waste facility or landspreading are prohibited.
(g) Stormwater and drain discharge. Direct subsurface drainage is
prohibited. Discharge of hazardous materials is prohibited. All
surface runoff and drain construction must provide a means for
collection or containment in the event of a hazardous materials
spill.
(h) Salt storage is prohibited.
(i) Hazardous/toxic materials storage and use are prohibited
except for normal home use.
(j) Hazardous/toxic wastes. On-site treatment, transfer, or
disposal is prohibited.
D. Zone B, Groundwater Protection Overlay District.
(1) Zone B is the recharge area upgradient of Zone A to the point
where it is estimated that groundwater and contaminants will take
five years to reach the pumping well(s). This is an intermediate
zone and land use measures are slightly less restrictive than Zone A
because of the longer flow times and greater contaminant dilution
and attenuation potential.
(2) The following uses are permitted:300
(a) Residential.
(b) Parks/playgrounds.
(c) Natural uses:
[1] Wildlife areas.

§ 550-41. Conservation Subdivision Overlay (CSO) District.
contemplated, a preliminary plat of the lands to be divided shall
accompany the petition for PUD approval.
H. Recordation of permit. Following approval by the Village Board, said
planned unit development agreement shall be recorded as a covenant
running with the land. Cost of recording shall be borne by the
petitioner.
A. Purpose. The Conservation Subdivision Overlay (CSO) District is
established for the following purposes:
(1) To provide an overlay district that may be used in conjunction with
an underlying residential zoning district to promote development of
conservation subdivisions.
(2) To preserve environmentally sensitive lands through permanent
preservation of open space and natural resources with housing
concentrated on portions of the site that have lower-quality natural
features.
(3) To provide open space areas that are commonly owned for passive
and/or active recreational use by residents of the development, and
where specifically established, for use by the general public.
(4) To minimize disturbance to environmentally sensitive areas,
protect biological diversity, and maintain environmental corridors
in their natural state to the extent practical.
(5) To preserve scenic views by minimizing views of new development
from existing roads.
(6) To provide buffering between residential development and
nonresidential uses.
B. Definition of conservation subdivision. A conservation subdivision is a
housing development characterized by extensive open space where
existing natural features of the land are maintained in their natural
state to the extent practical. Residential dwellings in such subdivisions
are located on portions of the site with lower-quality natural features
and should be adjacent to or overlook open space.
C. Platting methods and applicability of other regulations. Conservation
subdivisions may be created by platting methods including Certified
Survey Maps (CSMs), subdivision plats, or condominium plats. All of the
Village's land development regulations applying to each of the platting
methods shall be applicable to a conservation subdivision, except as
may be permitted in this section.
D. Uses. In a conservation subdivision, the underlying zoning district shall
determine allowable uses.
§ 550-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-41

subdivision shall be determined by applying the minimum lot area in
the underlying zoning district to the entire parcel proposed for
development. The minimum lot area in a conservation subdivision may
be less than that required in the underlying district, but shall not be less
than 10,000 square feet with sanitary sewer service, or not less than
30,000 square feet without sanitary service.
F. Setback and yards. The minimum setback and yard requirements in the
underlying zoning district may be modified in a conservation
subdivision to provide flexibility in the siting of homes relative to the
attributes of the individual lots or sites in the development. These
requirements shall be established on an individual development basis
and shall be determined prior to final plat approval. The minimum
setback and yard requirements shall be shown on the final plat or CSM.
G. Minimum living area and maximum building height. Shall be as
established in the underlying Zoning District.
H. Common open space. A conservation subdivision shall provide common
open space as follows:
(1) A minimum of 40% of the subject parcel shall be common open
space which shall be platted as one or more outlots. Wetlands,
floodplains, floodways, ponds or natural water bodies may
constitute a maximum of 60% of the minimum common open space
area.
(2) Prior to any final approval action on a conservation subdivision, the
Village Parks and Recreation Board shall review the proposed
common open space to determine if any public parklands or any
other public land dedication is necessary in conjunction with the
conservation subdivision.
(3) The ownership, maintenance, and stewardship of common open
space shall be accomplished by a homeowners' association and/or
condominium association in accord with Ch. 703, Wis. Stats. The
subdivision applicant shall provide a description of the bylaws of
the proposed association, and all documents governing the
ownership, maintenance, and use restriction for common facilities.
The association shall be established by the owner of the subdivision
developer prior to the sale of any lots or dwelling units in the
development. All documents to establish such association shall be
approved by the Village Attorney prior to their use by the
developer.
(4) No such owners' association shall be allowed to default and result
in the common open space being owned and maintained by the
public.
§ 550-41 SLINGER CODE § 550-41
1:548
(5) Each unit owner in a conservation subdivision shall have an
undividable fractional ownership interest in the common open
space outlot(s).
(6) A deed restriction shall be established to prevent subdividing any
common open space which is part of a conservation subdivision.
(7) A landscaping plan and a maintenance plan for common open space
areas shall be approved by the Planning Commission prior to final
plat approval.
(8) Any amendments to the common open space documents after their
initial approval shall be reviewed and approved by the Village
Attorney prior to such amendments taking effect.
(9) The following uses are permitted in common open space areas:
(a) Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example,
woodland, fallow field, or managed meadow).
(b) Silviculture, in keeping with established standards for
selective harvesting and sustained-yield forestry.
(c) Neighborhood open space uses such as common areas, picnic
areas, community gardens, trails and similar low-impact
passive recreational uses specifically excluding motorized offroad
vehicles, rifle ranges, and other uses similar in character
and potential impact as determined by the Planning
Commission.
(d) Active noncommercial recreation areas, such as playing fields,
playgrounds, courts and bikeways, provided such areas do not
encroach on environmentally sensitive areas. Playing fields,
playgrounds, and courts shall not be located within 50 feet of
abutting properties. Parking facilities for the same shall also be
permitted.
(e) Golf courses may comprise the open space land. Their parking
areas and any associated structures shall not be included
within the minimum open space requirement; their parking
and access ways may be paved and lighted.
(f) Water supply, water sources for the fire protection, sewage
disposal system, and stormwater detention areas designed,
landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the
open space.
(g) Easements for drainage, access, or other public purposes.

proposed conditional use. The requirements and conditions described
must be reasonable and, to the extent practicable, measurable and may
include conditions such as the permit's duration, transfer or renewal.
The Commission's approval of the proposed conditional use shall be
considered the approval of a unique request, and shall not be construed
as precedent for any other proposed conditional use.
E. Revocation. A conditional use permit shall remain in effect, provided
that the conditions of the permit are continued in the manner specified
by the permit or until the expiration of the permit as provided by its
terms. In the event the permit holder fails to comply with the conditions

Administrator upon 10 days' notice to the permit holder. The permit
holder shall be entitled to a hearing before the Village Planning
Commission on the questions of revocation of the conditional use
permit and approval of the Village Planning Commission shall be
required for the reinstatement of any conditional use permit.
F. Conditional use permits issued prior to August 5, 2019. Any conditional
use permits issued prior to the requirements established in this section
on its adoption date shall be considered as a conforming conditional
use. Any proposed change or amendment to such an existing
conditional use permit shall be processed in accord with the procedures
and requirements in this section as if it was being newly established.
A. Salvage yards.
(1) Each application shall be accompanied by a fee as set by the Village
Board, and in addition thereto, the applicant shall pay the
§ 550-46 SLINGER CODE § 550-46.1
1:558
reasonable cost of a review of the operational and restoration plans
by the Village.
(2) The applications shall be accompanied by a detailed description of
the proposed method of operation, the manner in which materials
will be stored, the equipment proposed to be used, the method of
disposition of the end products, the manner in which adjoining
property owners will be protected, the hours of operation, the
Village streets proposed to be used, the gross weight of equipment
to be used in the hauling in and out of any of the product, and
similar information as the Planning Commission may require.

performance bond in such amount and on such conditions as shall
be fixed by the Village Planning Commission.
(6) Any nonconforming salvage use which had a State of Wisconsin
salvage license prior to June 7, 1983, shall immediately apply to the
Village Planning Commission for a use and occupancy permit. The
Planning Commission shall require a plan of operation, final
restoration plan, intermediate restoration plans as deemed
necessary, and may impose such restrictions upon the use of such
site or structure as may be reasonable and not unduly burdensome
or onerous under the particular circumstances that may be
required.
B. Cellular and digital communication antennas and towers.
(1) The developer shall prepare a plan showing the number and
potential location of all antenna sites needed in the Village to
complete the communication network.
(2) All antennas shall be constructed on existing structures, such as
but not limited to water towers, public buildings, existing utility
towers, or other communication towers.
(3) If it is determined by the Planning Commission that such antennas
cannot be co-located on existing structures, freestanding tower
structures may be permitted, but such structures shall be designed
to support the proposed antennas and three additional sets of
communication antennas. The developer shall agree, in writing, to
make the structure available for co-location of similar
§ 550-46.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-46.1
1:559
communication equipment operated by other companies at a
reasonable return.
(4) The developer may be required to post a bond or cash deposit to
assure maintenance of communication equipment and its
supporting structures; and to assure that if such facilities are
abandoned, sufficient resources are available for the Village to
remove such equipment and structures.
(5) Minimum setback requirements. There shall be a setback of a
sufficient radius around the antenna structure (as measured from
the extremities of the antenna base) equal to the antenna tower
height so that its collapse will be contained on the property, except
when the applicant provides evidence from a Wisconsin-registered
structural professional engineer which allows for reduced setback
requirements.
(6) Any storage/equipment building associated with a cellular tower
shall meet the setback requirements for principal buildings in the
district in which it is located. A storage building shall not be
classified as an accessory use or building.
(7) New or modified towers shall be certified by a registered engineer
to be in accordance with structural standards for antennas by the
Electronics Industries Association.
(8) Abandoned or unused towers or portion of towers shall be removed
within 18 months of the cessation of operations at the site. In the
event that a tower is not removed within 18 months of cessation of
operations at a site, the tower may be removed by the Village and
the costs of removal assessed against the property. The
replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the
issuance of a new conditional use permit.
(9) Tower appearance and illumination.
(a) For towers not regulated by the Wisconsin Bureau of
Aeronautics or the Federal Aviation Administration, a surface
paint or finish shall be used that reduces the visibility of the
tower.
(b) Towers shall not be illuminated except as required by the
Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics or the Federal Aviation
Administration. When incorporated into the approved design of
the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking
lots, or similar areas may be attached to the tower. However,
such lights shall be directional and shall not produce glare into
residential areas.
(10) The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than warning or
equipment information is prohibited.
§ 550-46.1 SLINGER CODE § 550-46.1
1:560
(11)No new or existing telecommunications service shall interfere with
public safety telecommunications. All applications for new service
shall be accompanied by an intermodulation study which provides a
technical evaluation of existing and proposed transmissions and
indicates all potential interference problems. Before the
introduction of a new service or changes in existing service,
telecommunication providers shall notify the Village at least 10
calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the Village to
monitor interference levels during the testing process.
(12) Any newly constructed communication towers shall require
building/site landscaping in accordance with § 550-90 of this
chapter, and perimeter landscaping in accordance with the
following:
(a) For towers 200 feet in height or less, a buffer area no less than
25 feet wide shall commence at the property line. At least one
row of evergreen shrubs shall be spaced not more than five
feet apart. Shrubs should be of a variety which can be expected
to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height
within two years of planting. At least one row of evergreen
trees or shrubs, not less than four feet in height at the time of
planting, and spaced not more than 15 feet apart, shall also be
planted. Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be
of a type that would not exceed 20 feet in mature height or
would not affect the stability of the guys should they be
uprooted, and shall not obscure the visibility of the guy anchor
from the transmission building or security facilities and staff.
(b) For towers more than 200 feet, the provisions included in
Subsection B(12)(a) above shall be followed, including the
extension of the buffer area to 40 feet with an additional row of
deciduous trees not less than 2 1/2 inches caliper measured
three feet from the ground at the time of planting, and spaced
not more than 25 feet apart.
(c) Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest
practical extent. The site plan shall show any existing native
vegetation to be removed and shall indicate the type and
location of native vegetation to be replanted.
(13) A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided on each site.
Sites with personnel routinely in attendance shall be required to
install additional parking spaces based on the number of personnel
routinely on-site.
C. Where self-storage facilities may be located as a conditional use.
(1) Self-storage facilities may be less desirable than other higher
quality uses in certain commercial and industrial zoning districts.
This is due to the lack of job creation, lower quality buildings and
§ 550-46.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-46.1
1:561
site improvements, and less desirable visual appearance than other
land uses.
(2) Therefore, self-storage facilities should be located on sites which
have locational characteristics which may be adverse to
accommodating higher quality land uses. To accomplish this
objective, the Planning Commission shall review each request and
make a finding that some of the following criteria are met before
any such use is approved:
(a) Historic lack of other higher quality development
opportunities.
(b) Lack of existing or future sanitary sewer or potable water
service.
(c) Poor soil conditions not conducive to supporting larger
buildings such as low bearing capacity or high groundwater, or
contaminated soils.
(d) Poor visibility from adjacent or nearby roadways.
(e) Poor vehicular access to adjacent roadways.
(f) High traffic noise or other adverse environmental conditions.
(g) Sites where such uses would be an appropriate buffer or
transition between different land uses.
(3) Additional conditions. In the process of considering a request for
self-storage facilities, additional conditions may be required by the
Planning Commission. Such conditions may include condominium
property use restrictions and/or deed restrictions that would
describe or limit uses or activities which could occur on the
premises, architectural design features, or landscaping treatments,
and specific security measures such as fencing and lighting.
D. Outdoor sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages. The outdoor
sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages in circumstances where
a license is required under Ch. 125, Wis. Stats., may be allowed as a
conditional use as specified within the regulations of the zoning district.
Any such conditional use may be reviewed annually. Additionally, such
conditional use may be reviewed by the Planning Commission at any
time upon complaint or upon Planning Commission initiative. The
Planning Commission shall have the right to amend or further restrict
the use, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to the
conditional use holder.

Commission may grant an exception from any requirement to the extent
deemed just and proper. No exception to the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless the Village Planning Commission finds that all the
following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its
proceedings:
A. Exceptional circumstances. There are exceptional, extraordinary, or
unusual circumstances or conditions where a literal enforcement of the

preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by
other properties of the same use.

Signs
§ 550-54. Determine if sign permit and fee is required.
§ 550-55. Administration.
A. No sign shall be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended,
enlarged, converted, or structurally altered until a sign permit has been
issued in accordance with § 550-55 and a fee paid in accord with a fee
schedule established by the Village Board.
B. Temporary signs require registration in accordance with § 550-57. No
fee is required for temporary signs.
C. Certain types of signs do not require a sign permit and such signs are
described in § 550-56.
A. Approval of sign permits.
(1) The Building Inspector shall approve all sign permits. Certain signs
along state trunk highways may also require the approval of the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation.
(2) In the administration of these sign regulations, the Building
Inspector may consult with the Commission and/or the Zoning
Board of Appeals for interpretations on these regulations.306
B. Recording. The Building Inspector shall record and file all applications
for permits with any accompanying plans and documents, make
inspections of signs in the Village, and issue orders of noncompliance
for signs as may be required.
C. Computations. The following definitions shall control the computation
of sign area and sign height.
(1) Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only
one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square,
circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will
encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation,
emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which
it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or
decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets
zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display
itself.
306. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 550-54 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-55
1:573
(2) Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical
sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces
are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed
by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3) Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base of the sign at existing grade to the top of
the highest attached component of the sign. Existing grade shall be
the lower of: the grade prior to construction; or the newly
established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling,
berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating
the sign. In cases in which the existing grade is not reasonable for a
sign location, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that
the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to
the elevation of the nearest point of the center line of a public
street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the
principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
D. Sign permit application for permanent signs. A sign permit application
(provided by the Village) shall be completed and submitted with the
required fee to the Village Clerk. The application shall include the
following information:

any, and the method of construction and attachment.
(3) Site plan. Site plan, drawn to scale, of the location and position of
such sign in relation to structures and/or buildings, public right-ofway,
and any utility pedestrian easements.
(4) Master signage plan.
(a) Prior to approval of any sign permit in a commercial or
manufacturing district, particularly for multi-tenant buildings
or sites with multiple uses, the Planning Commission shall
approve a Master Signage Plan (MSP) for developments
approved after October 22, 2007. The purpose of the MSP is to
provide standards for design consistency on a site and avoid
cluttered and uncoordinated signage.

No sign except those permitted in §§ 550-55 and 550-57 shall be permitted
to face a residential or park district within 100 feet of such district
boundary.
§ 550-62. Lighting and color.
Signs shall not resemble, imitate, or approximate the shape, size, form, or
color of railroad or traffic signs, signals, or devices. Signs shall not obstruct
or interfere with the effectiveness of railroad or traffic signs, signals or
devices. Signs shall not be erected, relocated or maintained so as to prevent
free ingress to or egress from any door, window or fire escape. Signs shall
neither be placed so as to obstruct or interfere with traffic visibility, nor be
lighted in such a way as to cause glare or impair driver visibility upon public
ways. Signs may be illuminated, but nonflashing.
§ 550-63. Construction specifications.
(e) In the B-1 District, such signs shall not exceed 12 square feet
per side, or 24 square feet total, and shall be spaced a
minimum of 20 feet apart.
A. Wind pressure and dead load requirements. All signs and other
advertising structures shall be designed and constructed to withstand
wind pressure of not less than 40 pounds per square foot of area and
shall be constructed to receive dead loads as required in the Village of
Slinger Code or state or federal requirement.308
B. Supporting members or braces. Supporting members or braces of all
projecting or wall signs shall be constructed of galvanized iron,
properly treated steel, copper, brass or other noncorrosive,
noncombustible material. All projecting signs, if placed at right or other
angle to the wall or roof of any building, shall be attached by such
noncorrosive metal bolts, anchors, cable or other metal attachments as
shall insure permanent and safe construction and shall be maintained
from rust or other defects. Every means or device used for attaching
any sign shall extend through the walls or roof of the building, should
the Building Inspector determine that the safe and permanent support
of such sign so requires, and shall be securely anchored by wall plates
to the inside of the walls or to bearings on the underside of two or more

or window or so as to prevent the raising or placing of ladders against
such building by the Slinger Fire Department.
D. Plans. At the time of permit applications, plans shall be filed with the
Building Inspector for footings for signs eight feet to 20 feet, methods
of attachment of projecting signs, and engineering specifications and
calculations as required by the Building Inspector.
A. Safety. All signs shall be installed and maintained in a workmanlike
manner using equipment which is adequate and safe for the task. This
section recognizes that one of the greatest perils to the public safety is
improper performance of sign contractors in the use of adequate
equipment. As such, the Building Inspector may deny a sign permit if
the sign contractor does not have or does not arrange for use of
adequate equipment. The Building Inspector may also cite the sign
contractor for violation of this section if he fails to use proper
equipment in the maintenance of signs.
B. Electrical signs. An electrical permit shall first be obtained before an
electrical sign is installed. Electrical signs shall comply with Village,
state and NEC electrical codes. Electric sign contractors and their
employees are hereby authorized to perform the following tasks:
(1) Install exterior electric signs, ballasts or high voltage transformers
to sockets or outline lighting tubes, and may connect said signs to
primary branch circuit, if said circuit already exists outside of the
building;
(2) Install interior electric signs, but may not connect said signs to the
primary branch circuit;
(3) Maintain and replace any electric component within the sign, on its
surface or between the sign and building for exterior signs only.
This section prohibits the electric sign contractor or its employees
from performing work on electric signs in contradiction to
established electrical codes.
C. Maintenance and repair. Every sign, including but not limited to those
signs for which permits are required, shall be maintained in a safe,
presentable and good structural condition at all times, including
replacement of defective parts, burned out lighting elements, painting
(except when a weathered or natural surface is intended), repainting,
cleaning and other acts required for the maintenance of said sign. In
addition, the premises on which the sign is erected shall be kept in a
clean, sanitary and inoffensive condition, free and clear of all noxious
substances. The Building Inspector, shall require compliance with all
standards of this section. If the sign is not modified to comply with
safety standards outlined in this section, the Building Inspector shall

§ 550-65. Existing signs.
Signs lawfully existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this
chapter may be continued although the size or location does not conform
to this chapter. However, all nonconforming signs shall be deemed
nonconforming uses or structures and the provisions of Article VIII of this
chapter shall apply.
§ 550-66. Abandoned signs.
All signs or sign messages shall be removed by the owner or lessee to
the premises upon which a sign is located when the business it advertises
is no longer conducted. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign,
the Building Inspector shall give the owner a thirty-day written notice by
certified mail to remove said sign. Upon failure to comply with the first
notice, the Building Inspector shall, by certified mail, send a second notice
giving the owner an additional 48 hours to remove the sign. Upon failure
to comply with the second notice, the Village shall cause the removal to be
executed, the expenses of which shall become a lien against the property
as provided in § 66.0703(13), Wis. Stats., on the property on which the sign
is located as of the date of the removal of the sign and shall automatically
be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against
the property. All proceedings related to the collection, return and sale of
property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply.
require its removal in accordance with this section, or the sign shall
be removed under the authority of the Building Inspector, and costs
incurred shall be paid by the owner of the premises on which such sign
is located. Signs removed for maintenance and repair for over 30 days
shall be required to reapply for a sign permit before re-erecting the
sign, unless the Planning Commission has first granted an extension of
time.
D. Protection of the public. The temporary occupancy of a sidewalk or
street or other public property during construction, removal, repair,
alteration or maintenance of a sign is permitted, provided the space
occupied is roped off, fenced off or otherwise isolated.

1:586
§ 550-73. Noise.
Sirens, whistles, and bells which are maintained and utilized solely to serve
a public purpose are exempt from the sound level standards set forth in
§ 550-84 of this chapter.
§ 550-74. Special exceptions.
The Village Board is authorized to grant a special exception to waive or
modify any requirements of this chapter if, in the judgment of the Village
Board, it would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of this
chapter due to exceptional circumstances, to the extent deemed just and
proper on a case-by-case basis. The procedures and standards to be applied
are as follows.
provided the lot is on record in the County Register of Deed's Office
prior to the effective date of this chapter, and provided that the lot
is in separate ownership from abutting lands. A zoning permit for the
improvement of a lot with lesser dimensions and requisites than those
stated above shall be issued only after a variance is granted by the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
B. Substandard lots shall be required to meet the setbacks and other yard
requirements of this chapter.
A. Procedures.
(1) Petition. A party seeking a special exception shall file a petition
with the Village Clerk.
(2) Petition data required. The petition shall include all of the
following:
(a) A plot map drawn to scale of not less than 100 feet to the inch
showing the land in question, its location, the length and
direction of each boundary thereof, the location and existing
use of all buildings on such land and the principal use of all
properties within 300 feet of such land.
(b) The names and addresses of the owners of all properties within
300 feet of any part of the land included in the proposed
change.
(c) A detailed description of the intended development or use.
(d) Any further information as required by the Village Staff or
Village Board to facilitate the making of an evaluation of such
request, such as a site plan depicting proposed buildings,
parking, traffic impact, landscaping treatment, drainage,
sanitary sewer, erosion control and other factors as would be
pertinent including the impact on public facilities.
§ 550-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-74
1:587
(3) Hearing. The Village Board shall hold a public hearing upon receipt
of such petition. Notice of such public hearing shall be provided as
described in Article XIV of this chapter.
(4) Fee. The petition shall be accompanied by a fee payment as set
from time to time by the Village Board to defray the cost of
publication, notification, and holding a public hearing,
administrative expenses and expenses of Board members. The
petitioner shall also pay reimbursement to the Village for all costs
incurred for legal, planning, engineering, and administrative work
necessary to administer the application and oversee the project.
B. Basis of approval. An application for a special exception may be
approved, denied, or approved with conditions. In order to approve the
special exception, the Village Board must find that the applicant has
demonstrated all of the following:
(1) That the petition seeks approval of a structure that was
constructed pursuant to a building permit issued by the Village of
Slinger Building Inspector, in accordance with the plans filed with
the permit application and all conditions of the permit approval,
and only after completing construction was the structure found to
be in violation of the yard, building height and area, or green space
requirements of this chapter.
(2) That there are exceptional, extraordinary, or unusual
circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure,
use, or intended use, such that a literal enforcement of the
requirements of this chapter would result in a severe burden; and,
also, that such circumstances do not apply generally to other
properties or uses in the same district, or are of such a recurrent
nature as to suggest that the Zoning Ordinance should be changed.
(3) That the special exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by the applicant
and is not inconsistent with substantial property rights possessed
by other properties in the same vicinity.
(4) That the special exception will not create substantial detriment to
adjacent property or the general desirability of the Village and its
environs, and will not materially impair or be contrary to the
purpose and spirit of this chapter, or the adopted Village of Slinger
Comprehensive Plan, or the public interest.
C. Determination. The action of the Village Board shall be stated in writing
and shall include findings of facts setting forth the basis for the
decision. If a special exception is granted, or is conditionally granted, it
shall be subject to the written approval of the applicant, and upon such
approval it shall be recorded at the office of the Washington County
Register of Deeds. The decision of the Village Board shall be final and
shall not be subject to appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

[Amended 3-20-2017 by Ord. No. 02-01-2017]
§ 550-75. Existing legal nonconforming uses.
The lawful nonconforming use of a structure, land or water, existing at
the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be continued,
although the use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter,
however:
§ 550-76. Legal conforming uses on a conforming lot or legal
nonconforming lot containing legal nonconforming structures.
A. Only that portion of the land or water in actual use may be so continued.
Such uses may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted,
moved, or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or
order or so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
B. No structure containing a legal nonconforming use or, on lands
containing a legal nonconforming use, may be extended, enlarged,
rebuilt, substituted, intensified, moved, or added to except when
required to do so by law or until the legal nonconforming use has been
made to conform with this chapter.
C. Total lifetime structural repairs or alterations to a structure containing
a legal nonconforming use shall not exceed 50% of the assessed value of
the structure unless it is permanently changed to conform to the use
provisions of this chapter.
D. Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the Zoning Board
of Appeals if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the
nonconforming use with the neighboring uses.
E. If a legal nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period
of 12 months, any future use of the structure, land or water shall
conform to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
F. No lot on lands containing a legal nonconforming use, may be reduced
in size, modified, increased in size or changed in any manner except
when required to do so by law or until the legal nonconforming use has
been made to conform to this chapter.
A. A legal nonconforming structure with a conforming use existing at the
time of the adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance may be
continued although the structure's size, location, height, parking,
loading or access does not conform with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance.
B. Such structure shall not be extended, enlarged, or moved except when
required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance.

adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance may be continued
although the lot does not conform to the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance with the following conditions:
§ 550-78. Changes and substitutions.
Once a legal nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform
with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, it shall not revert back to
a legal nonconforming use or structure. The Zoning Board of Appeals
may permit the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use for
an existing legal nonconforming use. Once the Zoning Board of Appeals
has permitted the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use,
the existing use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use. The
substituted use shall be subject to all the conditions required by the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
C. A legal nonconforming structure with a legal conforming use may be
repaired, maintained, renovated, or remodeled in ways that do not
extend or enlarge the structure subject to building code and other
applicable requirements. There are no limits on the costs of such work.
D. Notwithstanding Subsections A, B, and C, above, repair, maintenance,
renovation, remodeling and restoration of such legal nonconforming
structure can be conducted under circumstances allowed by
§ 62.23(7)(hb) or (hc), Wis. Stats., in full compliance with statutes. This
Subsection D is intended to comply with § 62.23(hb) and (hc), Wis.
Stats.
A. Additions or enlargements to such structures are permitted provided
they conform to the established setback, offset, height, parking, loading
and access provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
B. Existing conforming structures on legal nonconforming lots which are
damaged or destroyed by violent wind, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold or
infestation may be restored to the size, location and use it had
immediately before the damage or destruction occurred. A larger size
than previously existed is also permitted if and to the extent necessary
for the structure to comply with applicable state or federal
requirements.

§ 550-85. Traffic noise limitations.
No owner of land adjacent to an existing freeway or adjacent to a planned
transportation corridor shall commence or cause to be commenced
construction of any structure that will be subject to traffic noise levels that
exceed the following sound level measured by a sound level meter:
A. Construction restrictions for habitable and institutional structures:
(1) No new single or two-family residential structure shall be approved
for construction (excluding substantial repair or alteration) if any
exterior hourly traffic sound level (Leq[h]) anywhere within the
proposed outdoor living area is projected to be equal to or in excess
of 67 db(A) upon completion of the structure or anytime thereafter.
(2) No new multifamily residence, dormitory, mobile home park,
transient lodging, school, hospital, nursing home or similar
structure, or substantial modification of such existing structure,
shall be approved if any exterior hourly traffic level (Leq[h])
anywhere within the proposed outdoor living area on the site is
projected to be equal to or in excess of 67 db(A) upon completion of
the structure or anytime thereafter.
(3) Construction otherwise prohibited shall be permitted if there are
no outdoor use areas on the site of the proposed structure
projected to be exposed to an hourly traffic sound level (Leq[h])
equal to or in excess of 67 db(A), provided that there is
incorporated into the design and construction of the structure such
sound attenuation measures as are necessary to reduce the
maximum interior hourly traffic induced sound level (Leq[h]) in a
habitable room to 52 db(A) upon completion of the structure or
anytime thereafter.
B. Construction restrictions for commercial and industrial structures:
(1) No new commercial or industrial structure, or substantial
modification of such existing structure, shall be approved if any

the structure or anytime thereafter.
(2) Construction otherwise prohibited shall be permitted if there are
no outdoor use areas on the site of the proposed structure (except
parking lots and storage areas) projected to be exposed to an
hourly traffic sound level (Leq[h]) equal to or in excess of 72 db(A),
provided that there is incorporated into the design and
construction of the structure such sound attenuation measures as
necessary to reduce the maximum interior hourly traffic induced
sound level (Leq[h]) in an interior work or public area to 59 db(A)
upon completion of the structure or anytime thereafter.
C. Noise attenuation plans:
§ 550-85 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-85
1:593
(1) If the Village of Slinger Planning Commission has reason to believe
that a report is necessary to determine whether a project will be
exposed to excessive traffic induced sound levels, such report shall
be made by the permit applicant prior to the approval of any
subdivision, zoning, or building permit approval. The report shall
be prepared by a registered professional engineer or other
qualified noise control consultant, and shall contain the following
information and any other information the Planning Commission
may reasonably require:
(a) The existing maximum hourly traffic sound level (Leq[h]) for a
representative sample of locations, measured in accordance
with guidelines set forth in "Sound Procedure for Measuring
Highway Noise: Final Report," dated August 1981, published
by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), Arlington, VA, or modeled according
to a methodology consistent with the methodology set forth in
the FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (Report No.
FHWA-RD-77-108);
(b) The projected future (Leq[h]) at the site resulting from future
traffic increases; and
(c) Where applicable, plans for sound attenuation measures on the
site and/or within the structure proposed to be constructed or
altered, and the amount of sound attenuation anticipated as a
result of these measures. Sound attenuation may be achieved
by separation from noise sources, berms, barriers,
landscaping, building construction materials, insulation, and
other building measures, or any combination thereof.
(2) In determining whether an applicant should be required to submit
a noise attenuation plan pursuant to § 550-85C of this chapter, the
Planning Commission shall consider the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation's Administrative Code Ch. Trans 405, Wis. Am.
Code, and the Federal Highway Administration's Procedures for
Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise, Title
23 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter J, Part 772.
D. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Village of Slinger
Planning Commission to prohibit a use or structure by reason of its
excessive hourly traffic sound level (Leq[h]) or by a decision of the
Planning Commission to require a Noise Attenuation Plan may appeal
such decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Article
XII of this chapter. Such appeal shall be made within 30 days following
the Planning Commission decision.

the district boundaries or amend, change, or supplement the regulations
established by this chapter or amendments thereto. Such change or
amendment shall be subject to the review and recommendation of the
Village Planning Commission.
§ 550-112. Initiation.

Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
A. Changes in the F-1 Floodplain District Boundaries shall not be
permitted where the change will increase the flood stage elevation in
excess of 1.0 foot. Flood stage increases exceeding 0.1 foot in height
shall not be permitted unless the petitioner has made appropriate legal
arrangements with all affected units of government and all property
owners affected by the stage increase. Petitions for floodland district
changes shall show the effects of the change utilizing both the equal
degree of hydraulic encroachment principle, and the equal degree of
hydrologic encroachment principle, and shall provide adjusted water
surface profiles and adjusted floodland limits to reflect the increased
flood elevations. It shall be the policy of the Village of Slinger that any
area removed from the floodland district shall be contiguous to lands
lying outside the floodlands, and where floodlands are removed, an
equivalent area and volume of floodland shall be added in the vicinity of
the removal.
B. Removal of land from the F-1 Floodland District shall not be permitted
unless the land has been filled to an elevation at least two feet above
the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood.

no more than 0.1 foot increase in flood stage unless appropriate legal
arrangements have been made. If the unnumbered A Zone is less than
five acres in area and where the cost of the proposed development is
less than $75,000, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) will assist the petitioner in determining the required flood
elevations.
D. No river or stream shall be altered or relocated until a floodland zoning
change has been applied for and granted in accordance with the
requirements of this section, and until all adjacent communities have
been requested to review and comment on the proposed alteration or
relocations. The flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
E. A copy of all notices for amendments or rezoning in the floodland
district shall be transmitted to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency
