CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE
VILLAGE OF PRAIRIE DU SAC
PREFACE
Democracy is a government of laws. Good democracy requires not only good laws, but laws which are
readily available in written form to all who are subject to them, to the public officials and police officers who must
administer them and to the judges and attorneys who must interpret and apply them. It is for this reason that the
Village Board of the Village of Prairie du Sac has adopted this Code of Ordinances. This Code represents the
contribution of the Village Board to the democratic and efficient administration of the government and affairs of
the Village of Prairie du Sac.

FOREWORD
We are pleased to provide this new Code of Ordinances for the Village of Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. This
codification provides a complete revision and codification of all Ordinances of a general and permanent nature of
the Village. All amended Ordinances are brought up to date. The Code also includes certain new Ordinances that
were prepared to fill gaps not covered by existing Ordinances.
The Code also includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles follow one
another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide
sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the alphabetical index at the end of
the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the
chapter.
Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are
covered by Title 1 of the Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have
been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes, state law references
and amendment notes have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions.
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the Village officials in the preparation of
this Code.

OPEN MEETING LAW GUIDE
General Requirements
1. Wisconsin's Open Meeting Law provides that all meetings of governmental bodies shall be open to all citizens
at all times. Sec. 19.81(2), Wis. Stats.
2. Meetings of local governing bodies or their subunits must be held in places reasonably accessible to the public.
3. Meetings are open to all members of the public unless specifically provided otherwise by law.
4. When members of a governmental body gather in sufficient numbers to compose a quorum, that meeting is
presumed to be convened for the purpose of conducting official business. Such a meeting is in violation of The
Open Meeting Law if proper notice was not given and the meeting is not open to the public. Sec. 19.82(2), Wis.
Stats.
Public Notice
1. WHO MUST RECEIVE NOTICE. For any meeting, the presiding officer, or his/her designee, shall give notice
to the official newspaper and to any other members of the news media who have filed a written request to receive
such notices, or if neither exists, in a manner likely to give notice to the public. Notice must also be given as
required by any other state statutes.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF NOTICE. The notice for the meeting shall include:
(a) the time, date and place of the meeting, and
(b) the subject matter of the meeting, including subject matter to be considered in closed session.
The governmental body may discuss, and if urgent, act upon matters which were not specifically referred to in the
agenda where the agenda contains a general item, such as "miscellaneous business." Where the presiding officer
has specific knowledge that matters may come before the body, they should be included on the agenda.
3. TIME FOR NOTICE. Notice must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the commencement of the
meeting unless for good cause such notice is impossible or impractical, in which shorter notice may be given. In
no case may notice be provided less than two (2) hours in advance of the meeting. Sec. 19.84(3), Wis. Stats.
4. COMMITTEES AND SUBUNITS EXEMPTION TO NOTICE REQUIREMENT. A legally constituted
subunit of a parent government body may conduct a meeting during the recess of the governing body's meeting or
immediately after the lawful meeting to act or deliberate upon a matter which was the subject of that meeting. For
this exemption to apply, the presiding officer must publicly announce the time, place and subject matter of the
subunit’s meeting in advance at the meeting of the governing body.
x
Procedure For Closed Sessions.
(1) Required notice must be given if the presiding officer or his/her designee knows that a closed session is
being contemplated. Notice is required regardless of whether a majority of members will or will not
support going into closed session at the meeting. Sec. 19.84(2), Wis. Stats.
(2) After first meeting in open session, with proper notice, or motion made and recorded, supported by
majority vote, is required to close, with the vote of each member recorded in the minutes. Sec. 19.85(1),
Wis. Stats.
(3) If the motion to go into closed session is carried, the presiding officer shall announce to those present at
the meeting (to be recorded in the minutes) the nature of the business to be considered in the closed
session and the specific exemption(s) relied upon in Sec. 19.85, Wis. Stats., under which the closed
session is permitted.
(4) Only matters contained in the presiding officer's announcement of the closed session may be considered
during the closed session.
(5) An open session, with adequate notice, must precede a closed session, even where it was decided at a
prior open session to go into a closed session at a subsequent meeting.
(6) A governmental body may vote to go into closed session at a properly convened open session, for a
permitted purpose, where specific notice of intent to consider going into closed session was not included
on the agenda at the time notice of the open session was given. However, such procedure requires that
the presiding officer or his/her designee did not contemplate or have knowledge that any of the other
members contemplated, a closed session at the time notice of the agenda was given.
Specific Exemptions Allowing Closed Sessions.
(1) Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., creates an exemption for governmental bodies deliberating after
quasi-judicial trials or hearings. However, boards of review cannot rely on this exemption, for Sec.
70.47(2m), Wis. Stats., requires all board of review meetings to be held in open session.
(2) Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law allowing the use of a
closed session when a governmental body is considering the demotion, dismissal, licensing, discipline or
tenure of a public employee or a person licensed by a board or commission. This exception permits
preliminary discussion and investigation without the necessity of providing actual notice to the individual
involved. However, before any evidentiary hearing can be conducted or formal action taken, notice must
be given to the person involved so that he or she can exercise his or her right to request an open session
for those purposes.
(3) Sec. 19.85(1)(c), Wis. Stats., sanctions the use of closed sessions where governmental bodies are
considering employment, promotion, compensation, or performance evaluation of any public employee.
Governmental bodies should exercise caution when considering performance to avoid discussing matters
that are covered by Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats.
xi
(4) Sec. 19.85(1)(d), Wis. Stats., permits the use of a closed sessions when applications for parole or
probation are being considered, or when crime detection or prevention strategy is to be discussed.
(5) Sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., allows closed sessions for the purpose of deliberating or negotiating the
purchase of public properties, the investing of public funds, or the conducting of other specified public
business, as long as competitive or bargaining reasons require a closed session. Under this exception, a
governmental body could meet in closed session for the purpose of forming negotiation strategies,
although the body must give notice that an open session will be held for the purpose of taking a vote to
convene in closed session for the purpose of discussing labor negotiation strategies.
(6) Discussions by governmental bodies considering the financial, medical, social or personal histories or
disciplinary data of specific persons which, if conducted in public, would have a "substantial adverse
effect upon the reputation of any person referred to" may be held in closed session under Sec.
19.85(1)(f), Wis. Stats. However, this exemption is unavailable where Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is
applicable.
(7) Sec. 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., allows a governmental body to confer with its legal counsel in closed
session for the purpose of obtaining oral or written advice concerning strategy to be adopted by the body
with respect to present and prospective litigation directly involving the governmental body.
(8) Closed sessions may be utilized by governmental bodies to consider requests for confidential written
advice from ethics boards under Sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats.
Limitations on Closed Sessions.
(1) Sec. 19.85(2), Wis. Stats., makes it impermissible for a governmental body to reconvene in open session
within twelve (12) hours after a closed session, unless public notice of the subsequent open session was
given at the same time and in the same manner as was required for the original open session.
(2) Final ratification or approval of a collective bargaining agreement is required to be in open session under
Sec. 19.85(3), Wis. Stats. However, a governmental body can vote to preliminarily approve bargaining
proposals in closed session, in order to reach a consensus, as long as final ratification occurs in open
session.
Ballots, Votes, and Records.
(1) Unless provided elsewhere by statute, no secret ballot may be utilized by a governmental body to
determine any election or decision, except the election of the officers of such body. This narrow
exception does not permit use of secret ballots to elect members of committees, officers of the
governmental units such as department heads, or fill vacancies on the body itself.
(2) Any member may require the ascertainment and recording of each vote.
(3) Records of motions and roll-call votes must be preserved and open for public inspection.
xii
Use of Equipment in Meetings.
(1) A governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the media's equipment.
(2) Any person may record, film or photograph a meeting in open session, provided that the use of this
equipment does not interfere with the conduct of the meeting(s).
(3) A member of a governmental body does not have the right to tape record a closed session of the board.

for the sanitary sewer or water main laid in the other street upon which such corner
lot abuts. Under any circumstance the assessment will not be less than the long way

damage be made in favor of the property, the Village Board shall assess only the
difference between such assessment of benefits and the award of compensation or
damage.

approved, the Village Board shall approve the work or improvement and by
resolution direct that the same be done and paid for in accordance with the
report finally approved.

specify that on a certain date a hearing will be held by the Village Board as to
whether the service in question shall be performed.

(a) INCOMPATIBLE EMPLOYMENT. No Trustee or other public official or
employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for
private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper
discharge of his official duties or tends to impair his independence of judgment or
action in the performance of his official duties. In the event a Trustee, official or
employee possesses a financial or personal interest in any business or transaction,
any presumption of conflict of interest with his public duties shall be removed by
his disclosure of the nature and extent of such investment to the Village Board for
the records of that authority.
(b) DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. No Trustee, other public
official or employee, shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential
information concerning the property, government or affairs of the Village, nor shall

of the local public official. This does not prohibit a local public official from
engaging in outside employment. See Section 19.59 Wis. Stats.
(d) REPRESENTING PRIVATE INTERESTS BEFORE VILLAGE AGENCIES OR
COURTS. No Trustee or other public official or employee whose salary is paid in
whole or in part by the Village shall appear in behalf of private interests before any

against the interest of the Village in any litigation to which the Village is a
party.
(e) CONTRACTS WITH THE VILLAGE. Any Trustee or other public official or
employee who has substantial financial interest in any business entity, entering into
or proposing to enter into, any transaction or contract with the Village for the sale
of real estate, material supplies or services to the Village shall disclose such
interest to the Village Board to be reported in the minutes of the appropriate Board
meeting. And in the case of a Trustee, he shall refrain from voting upon or otherwise
participating (except in the performance of a ministerial act) in the transaction
or the making of such contract or sale.
(f) DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST IN LEGISLATION.
(1) A Trustee who has a financial or other private interest in any legislation
shall disclose on the records of the Board the nature and extent of such
interest. This provision shall not apply if the Trustee disqualified himself
from voting.

interest, and who participates in discussion with or gives an official
opinion to the Board shall disclose on the record of the Board the nature
and extent of such interest.

approve such outside employment or activity if he/she finds that it does not interfere or

manner. Violation of this provision shall be grounds for removal from office of any such
officer.
History: Code of Ordinances, 1986. Sec 2-7-7 repealed and recreated. Ordinance No. 3, Series of 1995.

or receive a copy of any record as provided in Sec. 19.35(1), Wis. Stats.

(f) A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as
follows:
(1) The cost of photocopying shall be as stated in the Schedule of Fees per page,
excluding accident reports. Said cost has been calculated not to exceed the actual,
necessary and direct cost of reproduction. The cost of vehicle accident reports shall

(2) If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary
cost of photographing and photographic processing shall be charged.
(3) The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on
paper, such as films, computer printouts and audio- or video-tapes, shall be
charged.
(4) If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged.
(5) There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor
exceeds Fifty ($50.00) Dollars, in which case the actual cost shall be determined
by the legal custodian and billed to the requester. The Village will determine the
cost of locating a record by using the hourly rate as stated in the Schedule of Fees

(6) The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and may require a
cash deposit adequate to assure payment, if such estimate exceeds Five ($5.00)
Dollars.
(7) Elected and appointed officials of the Village shall not be required to pay for
public records they may reasonably require for the proper performance of their

also prominently display at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a copy of Section
2-9-4 through 2-9-6 of this Chapter. This subsection does not apply to members of the
Village Board.
SEC. 2-9-5 ACCESS PROCEDURES.
(a) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall
be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information
requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject
matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A
request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the
request is commenced under Sec. 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request
may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to
state the purpose of the request. A request may be refused because the request is received
by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2-9-4(f)(6). A requestor may
be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a
private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
(b) Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without
delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny
the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after
conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be
unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or
her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
(c) A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2-9-6. If a request is made
orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the
reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral
denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written
statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall
inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the
determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Sec.
19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.
SEC. 2-9-6 LIMITATIONS ON RIGHT TO ACCESS.
(a) As provided by Sec. 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt from inspection
under this Chapter.
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or
authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement
purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if
exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state;
2-9-5
(3) Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or
the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to
inspection; and
(4) Pursuant to Sec. 905.08, Wis. Stats., a record or any portion of a record containing
information qualifying as a common law trade secret. "Trade secrets" are defined

processes, which are used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or
processing articles, materials or information which are obtained from a person and
which are generally recognized as confidential.
(b) As provided by Sec. 43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records are exempt from
inspection under this section.
(c) In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically
exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney,
may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the
public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to
the request record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary
and given in order to obtain the information contained in them.
(2) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations after a
quasi-judicial hearing.
(3) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(b) and (c), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations
concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance,
or discipline of any Village officer or employee, or the investigation of
charges against a Village officer or employee, unless such officer or employee
consents to such disclosure.
(4) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(d), Wis. Stats., records concerning current strategy for
crime detection or prevention.
(5) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations or
negotiations on the purchase of Village property, investing of Village funds, or
other Village business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require
nondisclosure.

histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be
likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person
referred to in such history or data.
(7) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., communications between legal counsel
for the Village and any officer, agent or employee of the Village, when advice is
being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the
Village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become
involved, or communications which are privileged under Sec. 905.03, Wis. Stats.
(8) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats., requests for confidential written advice
from an ethics board, and records of advice given by such ethics board on such
requests.
(d) If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be
made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made
2-9-6
public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before
release. The custodian shall confer with the Village Attorney prior to releasing any such
record and shall follow the guidance of the Village Attorney when separating out the
exempt material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the Village Attorney there is no
feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without
unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be
withheld from disclosure.

Department of updated or added keys for the facility. It is the responsibility of the building
owner(s) to keep the area around the Emergency Key Box clear of obstructions including,
but not limited to, vegetation, paint, or clutter.
(e) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INVENTORY LIST, LOCATION AND CONTENTS.
Owners of buildings which are required to have and maintain one or more Material Safety
Data Sheets (MSDS) by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA)
Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200 or as directed by the Fire Chief shall have a Hazardous
Materials Inventory List in a location and cabinet approved by the Fire Chief or his/her
appointed representative. The Hazardous Materials Inventory List shall include an
alphabetical list of hazardous materials, location and approximate quantity on site. The
cabinet shall also include Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) of all chemicals located on

the Wisconsin Statutes, except as hereinafter provided. Water service to such property shall
not be restored until the cross-connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with the
5-4-3
provisions of this ordinance. If it is determined by the Water Utility that a cross-connection
or an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate action,
and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Administrator of the Village of Prairie du
Sac and delivered to the customer's premises, service may be immediately discontinued. The

§5-7-7 Penalty
SEC. 5-7-1 PURPOSE AND AUTHORIZATION
The Village Board has determined that in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the community, it is in the best interest of the citizens that the Village operate and
maintain a street lighting system and has further determined that the operation and maintenance
of such utility benefits each and every improved property within the Village. The Village Board
has therefore determined that it is fair, appropriate and reasonable that the costs of such operation
and maintenance be paid on a fair and reasonable basis by all of improved lots in the Village so
benefitted and the cost should be charged and collected from all such benefitted lots, except for
those exempted herein, through the imposition of charges as provided in this ordinance. In
promulgating the regulations contained in this chapter, the Village is acting pursuant to authority
granted by Wisconsin Statutes, including, but not limited to, Section 66.0627.
SEC. 5-7-2 DEFINITIONS
The following terms shall have the following meanings:
(a) “Improved Lot” means each tax parcel of land that has located thereon improvements
such as a building, garage, shed, storage facility, or any other type of structure providing
housing, storage, or any type of service of use. Improved Lots may have located thereon
Residential Unit(s) and/or Non-Residential Unit(s).
(b) “Residential Unit(s)” means single-family, two-family, and multifamily dwelling units.
The number of Residential Units shall equal the number of such dwelling units located on
an Improved Lot. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Improved Lot having
located thereon a multifamily structure containing three (3) or more dwelling units, and
where such individual units are not invoiced directly by the Village for public water and
sanitary sewer service, then in these events the Improved Lot shall be considered as
having located thereon a single Non-Residential Unit.
(c) “Non-Residential Unit(s)” means industrial, commercial, institutional, and the three or
more multifamily units described in (b) above, located on an Improved Lot.
5-7-2
SEC. 5-7-3 CHARGES
(a) The street light system service consists of all street lighting facilities owned and/or operated
by the Village and all street lighting facilities for which the Village purchases and supplies
electrical energy. In order to carry out the purposes identified, it is determined that it would
be just and equitable to recover some or all of the cost of operating the street light system
service on an equitable basis from each Improved Lot located within in the geographical
boundaries of the Village.
(b) The basis for computation of the charge for street light system services to Improved Lots
within the Village is established under this section; and such charges are based on the
total number of Residential Units and/or Non-Residential Units located on each Improved
Lot. All charges established pursuant to this chapter shall be fair and reasonable. A
schedule of current charges shall be maintained and on file in the office of the Village
Clerk.
(c) Charges shall be imposed to recover all or a portion of the costs of owning and operating
the street light system services. Such charges are those authorized from time to time by
the Wisconsin Public Service Commission and are invoiced to the Village of
Prairie du Sac by the Prairie du Sac Electric Utility. This amount shall be the known as
the Recovery Amount. The Recovery Amount shall be determined for each calendar
year, based upon the total amount invoiced to the Village for the period January through
December of such year. The total amount of the Recovery Amount for such year shall be
determined as of December 29 of such year insofar as is practicable. Once so
determined, the total Recovery Amount shall constitute the amount to be recovered from
Improved Lots for the following calendar year for street lighting services provided in
such year.
(d) Once the total Recovery Amount has been determined as provided for in (c) above, it
shall be divided by the total of (i) the number of Residential Units located on all
Improved Lots in the Village and (ii) the number of Non-Residential Units located on
Improved Lots in the Village, multiplied by a factor of 2.0. The resultant is herein
referred to as the Base Charge per Unit. (BC=RA/(R + 2NR)).
(e) The Base Charge to each Improved Lot shall equal (i) the sum of the Base Charge for
each Residential Unit thereon and/or (ii) the sum of the Base Charge for each
Non-Residential Unit thereon, multiplied by a factor of 2.0.
(f) Base Charges shall be invoiced on a monthly basis, with each monthly invoice being for
one-twelfth of the total Base Charge due from the Improved Lot.
SEC. 5-7-4 BILLING
Bills for street light system services charges shall be mailed to the recipient designated by the
owner of the tax parcel or the lessee to which the bill relates, provided that such mailing shall not
relieve the owner of rental property from liability for the charges in the event payment is not
made. The owner of any tax parcel which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine
the appropriate records of the utility to determine whether such rates and charges have been paid
by such tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which the records
are kept during normal business hours.
SEC. 5-7-5 PAYMENT, LIEN, LATE PAYMENT PENALTY
(a) Street light system charges shall be payable upon receipt. Street light system charges
shall not be payable in installments. If a charge remains unpaid for a period of 20 days
after it is due and payable said charge shall be deemed delinquent. Such delinquent
charge shall be subject to a late payment penalty shall be added. Said late payment
penalty shall be one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the delinquent charge per month.
5-7-3
(b) On October 15 in each year the Village Administrator shall give notice to the owner or
occupant of all Improved Lots to which street light system services have been provided prior
to that date and which are outstanding and in arrears at that time. The notice shall include
the following information:
(1) The amount of arrears, including any penalties assessed;
(2) That, if not paid by November 1, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of
arrears shall be added to that amount;
(3) That, unless paid by November 15, the arrears with added penalty will be levied
against that property and placed on the tax roll as a lien against the property;
(c) If payment is not received prior to November 15, the delinquent charge(s) will be forwarded
to the county treasurer for placement on the tax roll.
SEC. 5-7-6 APPEAL
(a) A Street light system charge may be appealed to the Public Works/Utilities Committee.
An appeal can be undertaken by filing a written appeal with the Village Clerk prior to the
due date of the charge or within 30 days of payments. However, no appeal can be taken
unless the disputed charges have been paid in full. The written appeal shall specify all
grounds for challenge to the amount of the charge and shall state the amount of charge
that the appellant considers being appropriate. Failure to appeal within 30 days of
payment shall deprive the Public Works/Utilities Committee of jurisdiction to hear the
appeal.
(b) In considering an appeal, the Public Works/Utilities Committee shall determine whether
the Street light system charge is fair and reasonable and, in the event the appeal is
granted, whether or not a refund is due the appellant and the amount of the refund. The
Public Works/Utilities Committee shall conduct a formal or informal hearing and obtain
sufficient facts upon which to make a determination. The decision of the Public
Works/Utilities Committee shall be based upon the evidence presented to it. The Public
Works/Utilities Committee shall notify the appellant in writing of its determination.
SEC. 5-7-7 PENALTY
A person violating this Chapter shall, upon conviction, pay forfeiture not to exceed $500 for each
offense, in addition to the costs of prosecution, which are allowed by law. Each day during which
a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.

SEC. 4-2-2 SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR.
(a) CONSTRUCT. It shall be the duty of the Village to construct public sidewalks along or
upon any existing public street in the Village of Prairie du Sac and to pay the entire cost of
construction thereof. Public sidewalks shall be located only along such streets as designated
by the Village Board. The Village Board may, at its discretion, substitute multiuse paths for

bicycling activity is anticipated. Carriage walks or similar type sidewalks shall not be
considered a public sidewalk.
(b) MAINTAIN. It shall be the duty of the Village to repair and perpetually maintain, and as
necessary repair and replace, public sidewalks along or upon any public street in the Village
of Prairie du Sac. It shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner to keep each

has approved otherwise. Any person or other entity found to have damaged, removed or
altered any public sidewalk without the permission of the Village Board shall be subject to
the cost of reversing such damage, removal or alteration. For purposes of this subsection (b),
the words “multiuse path” shall be synonymous with the words “public sidewalk.”
(c) PERMIT REQUIRED. No person shall hereafter lay, remove, replace, or repair any public
sidewalk within the Village unless the person is under contract with the Village to do such
work or has obtained a permit therefor from the Director of Public Works at least seven (7)
days before work is proposed to be undertaken. No fee shall be charged for such permits.
For purposes of this subsection (c), the words “multiuse path” shall be synonymous with the
words “public sidewalk.”
(d) SPECIFICATIONS. All public sidewalks hereafter shall be repaired, rebuilt and constructed
in accordance with the following specifications, except where the Director of Public Works
considers one or more of the specifications impractical for a repair or rebuild:
4-2-2
(1) Subgrade. The subgrade shall be prepared by excavating to the line, grade and cross
section as established by the Director of Public Works. Soft and unsuitable material
shall be removed and replaced with crushed stone or other satisfactory material, and
the subgrade shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted and moistened
immediately before the concrete is placed. When so specified by the Director of
Public Works, a sub-base of crushed stone, gravel or other approved porous material
shall be placed under the sidewalk. On embankments the subgrade shall extend at
least one (1) foot beyond each edge of the sidewalk.
(2) Material. All concrete for sidewalk shall conform to the requirements of Section
501 of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Standard Specifications,
latest addition, and shall be Grade A or A-FA.
(3) Forms. When using forms, concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood or
metal of sufficient strength to resist springing, tipping or other displacement during
the process of depositing and consolidating the concrete. Wood forms shall be
surfaced plank of at least two (2) inches thickness except for sharply curved
sections. Metal forms shall be of approved section. The forms shall be of full depth
of the required walk and shall be of such design as to permit secure fastening. Forms
shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled before the concrete is placed against them.
Concrete shall be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade, deposited just above the
finished grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar to the
surface and to prevent honeycombing. The concrete shall then be struck off level
with the top of the forms and finished with wooden flats.

tool. Sidewalks shall be constructed within the limits of the street right-of-way, and
unless otherwise specifically indicated, there shall be at least six inches of strip of
street right-of-way left between the abutting property line and the nearest edge of

land uses shall be not less than five (5) feet in width and five (5) inches in thickness
except within driveway approaches where the minimum thickness shall be seven (7)
inches.
(6) Finishing. Before the last finish has set, the sidewalk shall be steel troweled and
brushed in transverse direction. Before the final finishing, the surface shall be
checked with a ten (10) foot straight edge and any areas departing more than
one-eighth (1/8) inch from the testing edge shall be corrected by adding or removing
concrete while the concrete in the walk is still plastic.
(7) Jointing. Transverse, full depth, one-half (1/2) inch thick expansion joints of premolded

walk, curb line, building or driveway approach, and at buildings, walls, poles and
stop boxes. The expansion joint material shall be placed in a neat and workmanlike
manner with its upper edge slightly below the finished sidewalk surface.
Contraction joints for controlled cracking, at least three-eighths (3/8) inch in
thickness and a depth of one-fifth of the total thickness of the concrete, shall be
placed at intervals of approximately four (4) feet. All joints shall be at right angles

(8) Curing. As soon as any of the concrete work hereinbefore mentioned has been
finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent excessive marring of the surface, it
shall be cured and protected against rapid drying. Failure to comply with this
requirement shall be deemed sufficient cause for suspension or replacement of the
work. Curing shall be accomplished by the "Impervious Coating," "Wet Fabric" or
"Paper" methods. For impervious coating or membrane curing, only those materials
meeting requirements of AASHTO M148 shall be used. Said specifications are
hereby adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein. Sidewalks shall be kept free
from all traffic at normal temperatures for forty-eight (48) hours and in cold weather

(c) PROTECTION OF PUBLIC.
(1) Every opening and excavation shall be enclosed with sufficient barrriers. Sufficient
warning lights shall be kept on from sunrise to sunset. Such lights shall be spaced so
as to give adequate warning of the existence of the opening and of piled excavated
materials. No open flame warning pots shall be used. Except by special permission

vehicles or property of any kind.
(d) REPLACING STREET SURFACE. In opening any public street, public alley, public
sidewalk, public way, public easement, or public ground, the paving materials sand, gravel
and earth or other material moved or penetrated and all surface monuments or hubs must be

backfill material. All rubbish shall be immediately removed. In refilling the opening, the
earth must be puddled or laid in layers not more than six (6) inches in depth and each layer
rammed, tamped or flushed to prevent after-settling. When the sides of the trench will not
stand perpendicular, sheathing and braces must be used to prevent caving. No timber,
bracing, lagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any trench. The Village may elect
to have the opening for any street or sidewalk repaired by the Village, in which case the cost
4-2-5
of making such repair and of maintaining it for one year shall be charged to the person
making the street opening.
(e) NOTICE. It shall be the duty of the permittee to notify the Superintendent of Public Works

prior to backfilling and or restoring the surface.
(f) VALIDITY OF PERMIT. Unless the work shall be commenced within thirty (30) days of
the issuance of the permit, the permit shall be void, and a new permit must be obtained and

within a period of ten (10) days or such longer period as determined by the Superintendent
of Public Works, the Village may restore the surface and bill the permittee therefor.

protection of property, life, health, or safety without obtaining an excavation permit,
provided that such person firm or corporation shall apply for an excavation permit not later
than the next business day.
(i) EXCAVATION IN NEW STREETS LIMITED. Whenever the Village Board determines to

permit shall be issued to open or excavate said street for a period of five (5) years after the
date of improvement or repaving unless in the opinion of the Village Board an emergency
exists which makes it absolutely essential that the permit be issued.

determined by the Streets and Storm Sewers Committee that a
public nuisance exists, it shall forthwith order the immediate
abatement thereof. Unless the property owner abates the nuisance
as directed within five (5) days after such hearing, the Forester
shall proceed to abate the nuisance and cause the cost thereof to be

privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned, possessed, controlled or
exercisable by the Grantee or any successor pertaining to the construction, operation,

Chapter, the franchise agreement, or with applicable law, or its officers have
been convicted of a felony;
(2) The quality of the Grantee’s service, including signal quality, response to
consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or

Village may revoke the Grantee’s franchise and terminate the franchise agreement
pursuant to the revocation procedures set out in Section 5-1-8.

interest, continue to operate the cable system under the terms and conditions of this
Chapter and the franchise agreement and to provide the regular cable service and any of
the other services that may be provided at that time.
SEC. 5-1-9 OTHER REMEDIES
(a) Lesser Remedies. Nothing shall prohibit the Village from invoking lesser remedies than
revocation for violations of the provisions of this Chapter or the franchise agreement,
including imposing monetary damages as set out in Subsection (c) below.
(b) Notice and Opportunity to Cure Prior to Imposition of Monetary Damages. In the event
that the Village determines that the Grantee has failed to perform any material obligation
under this Chapter or the franchise agreement, the Village may make a written demand
on the Grantee that the Grantee cure such breach and inform the Grantee that continued
breach may be cause for the imposition of monetary damages. If the breach is not cured
to the satisfaction of the Village within thirty (30) days following such demand, the
Village may impose monetary damages on the Grantee as set out in Subsection (c).
(c) Monetary Damages. If after notice to the Grantee and opportunity for hearing, the
Village determines that the Grantee has failed to perform any material obligation under
this Chapter or the franchise agreement, or fails to do so in a timely manner, the Village
may at its option, and in its sole discretion assess monetary damages against the Grantee
as provided in this Subsection (c). This provision for assessment of damages is intended
to be separate and apart from the Village’s right to enforce the provisions of the
construction and performance bonds provided for in this Chapter and is intended to be in
addition to any other remedies. This provision is intended to provide compensation to
the Village for actual damages.
(1) For failure to comply with any of the customer service standards adopted by the
Village in this Chapter or set out in the franchise agreement, the Grantee shall
pay to the Village the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for each day the
Grantee fails to comply.
(2) For failure to furnish, maintain, or offer cable services to any potential
subscriber within the territorial limits of the Village in accordance with Section
5-1-11
5-1-13 of this Chapter or upon order of the Village, the Grantee shall pay to the
Village the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for any such occurrence.
(3) For failure to obtain or file evidence of required insurance or other required
financial security, the Grantee shall pay to the Village the sum of Three Hundred
Dollars ($300.00) for any such occurrence.
(4) For failure to provide access to data documents, records or reports to the Village
as required by this Chapter, the Grantee shall pay to the Village the sum of One
Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for any such occurrence.
(5) For failure to comply with applicable construction, operation, or maintenance
standards, the Grantee shall pay to the Village the sum of Three Hundred Dollars
($300.00) for any such occurrence.
(6) Failure to comply with a rate decision or refund order issued by the Village, the
Grantee shall pay to the Village the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for
any such occurrence.
SEC. 5-1-10 PURCHASE OF SYSTEM BY VILLAGE
(a) Purchase of System by Village on Revocation. If the Village revokes the franchise for
cause, the Grantee shall first offer the system for sale to the Village at an equitable price
under the following procedures:
(1) If the determination of an equitable price cannot be negotiated or determined by
the Village and the Grantee, the price shall be determined by an impartial
appraisal procedure pursuant to Ch. 788, Wis. Stats., wherein the Grantee and
the Village shall each choose an appraiser and the appraisers chosen shall choose
a third appraiser and the price determined by such appraisers shall be considered
the equitable price at which the system will be offered to the Village. The
determination of the price of the system shall be decreased by the amount of any
and all damages sustained by the Village in connection with revocation,
including without limitation, payment made by the Village to another person or
entity to operate the system for a temporary period after revocation. The cost of
the appraisal procedure shall be shared equally by the Village and the Grantee.
(2) The Village shall have ninety (90) days commencing on the day the equitable
price of the system is determined either through negotiation or the appraisal
procedure to exercise its option to purchase. If the Village does not exercise its
option to purchase, and the system is not sold to another operator who has
obtained a franchise from the Village, the Grantee, upon request by the Village,
shall promptly remove all its facilities from the franchise area. While transfer of
the system and franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered, the Grantee
may be required to continue service to the public.
(b) Purchase of System by Village on Non-renewal. If the Village determines not to renew a
Grantee’s franchise, the Grantee shall first offer the system for sale to the Village at fair
5-1-12
market value, determined on the basis of the system valued as a going concern but with
no value allocated to the franchise itself. The following procedures shall be followed:
(1) If the determination of fair market value cannot be negotiated or determined, the
value shall be determined by an impartial appraisal procedure pursuant to Ch.
788, Wis. Stats., wherein the Grantee and the Village shall each choose an
appraiser and the appraisers chosen shall choose a third appraiser and the valuation
determined by such appraisers shall be considered the fair market value at
which the system will be offered to the Village. The determination of the value
of the system shall be decreased by the amount of any damages sustained by the
Village in connection with non-renewal, including without limitation, payment
made by the Village to another person or entity to operate the system for a
temporary period after non-renewal. The cost of the appraisal procedure shall be
shared equally by the Village and the Grantee.
(2) The Village shall have ninety (90) days commencing on the day the fair market
value of the system is determined either through negotiation or the appraisal
procedure to exercise its option to purchase. If the Village does not exercise its
option to purchase, and the system is not sold to another operator who has
obtained a franchise from the Village, the Grantee, upon request by the Village,
shall promptly remove all its facilities. While transfer of the system and
franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered, the Grantee may be required
to continue service to the public.
SEC. 5-1-11 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL
(a) Transfer of Franchise. Any franchise granted under this Chapter shall be a privilege to
be held for the benefit of the public. Any franchise so granted cannot, in any event, be
sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of by any method, including, but not
limited to, forced or voluntary sale, merger, or consolidation, either in whole or in part,
without the prior written consent of the Village, and then only under such reasonable
conditions as the Village may establish. Such consent as required by the Village, shall
be given or denied no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following any
request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld. Prior consent shall not be required
when transferring the franchise between wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same entity.
(b) Notice to Village on 20% Change of Ownership or Control. A Grantee shall promptly
notify the Village in writing of any proposed change in, or transfer of, control of the
Grantee. For the purpose of this Subsection, a change in, or transfer of, control shall
occur on the acquisition or transfer by any person of twenty (20) percent or more of the
beneficial ownership interest in the Grantee.
(c) Consent of Village Required on 51% Change of Ownership or Control. In the event that
any person or group of persons acquires or transfers fifty-one (51) percent or more of the
beneficial ownership interest in the Grantee, Grantee's franchise shall be subject to
cancellation unless and until the Village shall have consented in writing to the
acquisition or transfer. The Village shall give or deny consent no later than one hundred
and twenty (120) days after receiving written notice of the acquisition or transfer. The
5-1-13
Village's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the Village
may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee
shall assist the Village in any such inquiry.
(d) Grantee’s Responsibility. In seeking the Village’s consent to any change in ownership or
control, the Grantee shall have the responsibility to do the following:
(1) To show to the Village’s satisfaction, whether the proposed purchaser, transferee,
or assignee (the "proposed transferee"), which in the case of a corporation,
shall include all directors and all persons having a legal or equitable interest of
fifty-one (51) percent or more of the voting stock, (1) has ever been convicted of
a felony or is presently under an indictment, investigation or complaint charging
a felony; (2) has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of competent
jurisdiction; or (3) has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative
proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system.
(2) To establish to the Village’s satisfaction, the financial solvency of the proposed
transferee by submitting all current financial data for the proposed transferee
which the Grantee was required to submit in its franchise application, and such
other data as the Village may request, where the same shall be audited, certified
and qualified by a certified public accountant.
(3) To establish to the Village’s satisfaction, that the legal, financial and technical
capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable it to maintain and
operate the cable system for the remaining term of the franchise under the
existing franchise terms.
(e) Effect of Village’s Consent to Transfer. The consent or approval of the Village to any
transfer by the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Village
in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms
and conditions of any franchise. The Grantee shall not be released from its obligations
under this Chapter and the franchise agreement without the express written consent of
the Village.
(f) Transfer Document to be Filed with Village. A Grantee, upon transfer, shall within sixty
(60) days thereafter file with the Village a copy of the deed, agreement or other written
instrument evidencing such sale, transfer of ownership or control or lease, certified and
sworn to as correct by the Grantee.
(g) Village’s Right to Purchase System. The Village shall be entitled to a right of first
refusal of any written offer to purchase the Grantee’s system, which offer the Grantee
has accepted subject to the Village's rights under this Chapter. The price to be paid by
the Village shall be the price of such offer on the same terms and conditions as such
offer. The Village shall notify the Grantee of its decision to purchase within ninety (90)
days of the Village's receipt from the Grantee of a copy of the offer.
5-1-14
SEC. 5-1-12 FRANCHISE AREA
A Grantee’s franchise area shall be the territorial limits of the Village of Prairie du Sac as they
may exist now and in the future.
SEC. 5-1-13 EXTENSION OF SERVICE
(a) Developed Areas. In developed areas of the Village, the Grantee shall, on request of a
potential subscriber, extend service to the potential subscriber pursuant to the following
requirements:
(1) Without regard to density of dwelling units, the Grantee shall extend and make
cable television service available to any dwelling unit within three hundred (300)
feet of existing cable plant.
(2) Where the dwelling unit is not within three hundred (300) feet of existing cable
plant, the Grantee shall provide to any potential subscriber desiring service an
estimate of the cost to extend service to the potential subscriber. The Grantee
shall extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The Grantee and
the potential subscriber shall share the cost of the extension as follows: the
Grantee shall pay one hundred (100) percent of the cost of the first three hundred
(300) feet of the extension and shall pay sixty (60) percent and the potential
subscriber forty (40) percent of the cost of the next three hundred (300) feet of
the extension, up to a maximum of six hundred (600) feet. For that part of an
extension that is longer than six hundred (600) feet, the Grantee may charge the
potential subscriber for the Grantee’s actual cost of that portion of the extension.
Within one year, any amount paid by a subscriber for an extension under this
subsection shall be refundable to that subscriber in the event the area
subsequently reaches a density level of seventeen (17) dwelling units per strand
mile. In no event shall the amount of the refund exceed the amount paid by the
subscriber for the extension.
(b) New Subdivisions/Newly Developed Areas. The Grantee shall, at its expense, extend its
system so that cable service is available in all new subdivisions or newly developed areas
in the Village. The Village may waive this requirement on a project basis on good cause
shown by the Grantee.
(1) In a new subdivision or developing area where utility and cable facilities are to
be above ground, the Village will forward to the Grantee an approved
engineering plan of each project. The Grantee shall commence the design and
construction process upon receipt of the plan. Upon notification from the
Village that the first home in the project has been approved for a building permit,
the Grantee shall have three (3) months to complete construction, unless the
Village agrees to extend this time period.
(2) In a new subdivision or developing area where utility and cable facilities are to
be placed underground, the Village shall give the Grantee at least thirty (30)
days advance written notice of the date on which open trenching will be
5-1-15
available for the Grantee’s installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and
laterals to be provided at the Grantee’s expense. The Grantee shall provide
specifications as needed for trenching and shall place its facilities in the trenches
on the date specified in the notice. Costs of trenching and easements required to
bring cable service to the new subdivision shall be non-discriminatory and shall
be paid by the Grantee.
(c) Special Agreements. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the Grantee
from serving areas not covered under this Section upon agreement with developers,
property owners, or residents, provided that five (5) percent of the gross revenues
derived from such service within the franchise area are returned to the Village as
required under Section 5-1-18 of this Chapter.
SEC. 5-1-14 ACCEPTANCE AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF FRANCHISE
(a) Effective Date. Any franchise awarded under this Chapter shall take effect thirty (30)
days after the effective date of the franchise agreement between the Village and the
Grantee provided that the Grantee has accepted the franchise pursuant to Subsection (b).
(b) Acceptance. To accept a franchise granted under this Chapter, a Grantee must file any
required bonds, funds and proof of insurance, as well as written notice of acceptance,
with the Village Administrator.
(c) Written Notice of Acceptance. The Grantee’s written notice of acceptance shall include
a certification that the Grantee agrees to the following:
(1) Grantee to Have No Recourse. The Grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever
against the Village for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of any
provision or requirement of this Chapter or its regulation or from the Village's
exercise of its authority to grant additional franchises.
(2) Acceptance of Power and Authority of Village. The Grantee expressly
acknowledges that in accepting the franchise it has relied upon its own
investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the Village to
grant this franchise.
(3) Inducements Not Offered. The Grantee acknowledges by acceptance of the
franchise that it has not been induced to enter into this franchise by any
understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or written, by or on
behalf of the Village concerning any term or condition of this franchise that is
not included in this Chapter.
(4) Grantee Accepts Terms of Franchise. The Grantee acknowledges by the
acceptance of the franchise that it has carefully read its terms and conditions and
it is willing to and does accept all the obligations of such terms and conditions
and further agrees that it will not set up as against the Village the claim that any
provision of this Chapter as adopted, is unreasonable, arbitrary, invalid or void,
5-1-16
but shall be required to accept the validity of the terms and conditions of the
franchise in their entirety.
SEC. 5-1-15 RATE REGULATION
(a) Village Reserves Right of Rate Regulation. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection
(b), below, the Grantee shall establish rates for its services which shall be applied on a
nondiscriminatory basis in the franchise area. Pursuant to federal law, the Village
reserves the right to assume regulation of rates paid by cable subscribers; such rate
regulation shall be performed by the Village Board in accordance with FCC Rules and
Regulations “Part 76, Subpart N.” As specified by the FCC’s Rules (Part 76, Subpart N),
such rate regulation shall cover basic service rates and customer premises installations
and equipment rates (including charges for, but not be limited to, converter boxes,
remote control units, connections for additional television receivers and other cable
home wiring). The Village reserves the right to further regulate rates pursuant to any
additional powers granted to it by either the FCC or federal or state law.
(b) Service Disconnection. A subscriber shall have the right to have its service disconnected
without charge, except for actual costs incurred by the Grantee or other charges that are
allowable under FCC regulations, which shall include the removal of any equipment
owned by the Grantee from the subscriber’s residence. Such disconnection shall be
made as soon as practicable and in no case later than thirty (30) days following written
notice to the Grantee of same. No Grantee shall enter into any agreement with a
subscriber which imposes any charge following disconnection of service, except for
reconnection and subsequent monthly or periodic charges, and those charges shall be no
greater than charges for new customers. This Section shall not prevent a Grantee from
refusing service to any person because of the Grantee’s prior accounts with that person
which remain due and owing.
SEC. 5-1-16 PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
(a) Discriminatory Practices Prohibited
(1) A Grantee shall not refuse cable television service or otherwise discriminate
against any person or organization who requests such service on the basis of
race, color, religion, national origin, creed or sex. A Grantee shall not, as to
rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations or in any other respect, make
or grant any unreasonable preference or advantage, nor subject any person to any
prejudice or disadvantage. The Grantee shall comply at all time with the Cable
Act and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and all
executive and administrative orders relating to non-discrimination which are
hereby incorporated and made part of this Chapter by reference.
(2) This Section shall not be deemed to prohibit promotional rates for service
introductions or temporary promotional discounts. This Section does not
preclude a Grantee from offering special services or rates to senior citizens, or
services to commercial subscribers at rates different from those charged
residential subscribers, which shall include, but not be limited to, charges for
5-1-17
installation on a time and material basis. The Grantee may also enter into
separate contracts with multiple dwelling unit buildings and may charge
discounted rates for services based upon single point billing or other contractual
considerations.
(b) Fairness and Equal Access. A Grantee’s system shall be operated in a manner consistent
with the principles of fairness and equal access to its facilities, equipment, channels,
studios and other services for all citizens, businesses, public agencies or other entities
having a legitimate use for the system and no one shall be arbitrarily excluded from its
use. Allocation of use of such facilities shall be made according to the rules or decisions
of regulatory agencies affecting the same, and where such rules or decisions are not
effective to resolve a dispute between conflicting users or potential users, the matter
shall be submitted for resolution by the Village.
(c) Equal Employment. A Grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity
requirements of federal, state and local laws and regulations in effect on the date of the
franchise grant, and as amended from time to time.
(d) Discontinuation of Service. If a subscriber fails to pay any proper fee or charge for any
service provided by the Grantee, the Grantee may discontinue said service, provided that
the unpaid bill is at least forty-five (45) days past due and the subscriber has been given
at least ten (10) business days prior notice of the intention to discontinue service. If the
Grantee receives payment of all outstanding fees and charges, including any late charges,
before any service has been discontinued, then the Grantee shall not discontinue said
service. After any service has been discontinued, upon request of the subscriber
accompanied by payment in full of all fees or charges due the Grantee and the payment
of an appropriate reconnection charge, if any, the Grantee shall promptly reinstate said
service. Subscribers shall retain the right to deactivate their terminals, but shall continue
to be responsible for charges until the Grantee is notified to terminate service. The
subscriber shall not be charged any fee for the cancellation or downgrading of cable
service, except in accordance with applicable FCC regulations.
(e) Rights of Residents.
(1) An owner or operator of an apartment building, condominium, nursing home,
mobile home park, or any other rental facility may not interfere with or charge a
fee for the installation of cable system facilities for the use of a lessee of said
property or premises, except that such owner or operator may require:(1)
installation to conform to reasonable conditions necessary to protect the safety,
appearance and functioning of the premises; (2) the Grantee, occupant, or tenant
to pay for the installation, operation, or removal of such facilities; and (3) the
Grantee, occupant, or tenant to agree to indemnify the owner or operator for any
damages caused by the installation, operation or removal of such facilities.
(2) It shall be unlawful for the Grantee to compensate or offer to compensate any
person, or for any person to demand or receive compensation from the Grantee,
for the placement upon the premises of such person of Grantee's facilities
necessary to connect such person's premises to the distribution lines of Grantee
to provide cable service to said premises.
5-1-18
(3) Except where there is a bulk rate agreement between a landlord and the Grantee,
a landlord may not discriminate in the amount of rent charged to tenants or
occupants who receive cable service and those who do not.
SEC. 5-1-17 ACCEPTANCE FEE
Upon the grant of a new franchise, the Grantee shall reimburse the Village for all reasonable
costs -- including but not limited to attorney and consultant fees -- incurred by the Village
relating to the grant of the new franchise.
SEC. 5-1-18 FRANCHISE FEE
(a) Annual Franchise Fee. A Grantee shall pay to the Village an annual franchise fee in the
amount designated in the franchise agreement. Such franchise fee shall not be less than
5% of the Grantee's annual gross revenues, or such other maximum amount as allowed
by law. In the event that a change in either state or federal law would allow the Village
to increase the franchise fee above five (5) percent of the Grantee's annual gross
revenues, the Grantee shall not be liable for such increase until the Village shall give
Grantee written notice of such change in the law. The franchise fee payment shall be in
addition to any other payment owed to the Village by the Grantee and shall not be
construed as payment in lieu of municipal property taxes or other state, county or local
taxes.
(b) Payment Schedule. The franchise fee shall be paid on a bi-annual basis according to the
following schedule: revenues for January through June shall be reflected in an August
15th payment and revenues for July through December shall be reflected in a February
15th payment. Unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement, the payment
period shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise or any renewal date.
(c) Financial Statement to be Provided by Grantee. With each February 15th franchise fee
payment, a Grantee shall furnish to the Village an audited statement, reflecting the total
amount of the gross revenues and all payments, deductions and computations for the
period covered by the franchise fee payment. The Village shall have the right to conduct
an independent audit of the Grantee’s records, and if such audit indicates a franchise fee
underpayment of five (5) percent or more, the Grantee shall assume all reasonable costs
of such audit.
(d) Interest on Delinquent Payments. If any payment is not made as required, interest on the
amount due shall accrue from the date of the required submittal at an annual rate of
twelve (12) percent. The Grantee shall pay an additional compensation to the Village if
the payment is late by forty-five (45) days or more. Such additional compensation shall
be equal to an additional six (6) percent per annum in order to defray those additional
expenses and costs incurred by the Village by reason of the delinquent payment.
(e) Acceptance by the Village. No acceptance of any payment by the Village shall be
construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Village may have
5-1-19
for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this Chapter or for the
performance of any other obligation of the Grantee.
(f) Alternative Fee Basis. In the event the franchise fee payment established under this
Chapter is ruled unconstitutional or unenforceable, the Village may impose and collect
an equivalent charge on any legally permissible basis, provided such charge does not
exceed the previously allowed limit on franchise fee payments.
SEC. 5-1-19 CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS
(a) Additional Standards May be Imposed. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
prohibit the Grantee and Village from agreeing to exceed the customer service standards
set out in this Chapter or the establishment or enforcement of any state or local law or
regulation concerning customer service or consumer protection that imposes customer
service standards or consumer protection requirements that exceed the customer service
standards set out in this Chapter or address matters not addressed in this Chapter.

customer.)
(iv) The Grantee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the close of business
on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If the Grantee’s representative
is running late for an appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the
appointment as scheduled, the customer will be contacted. The appointment will be
rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the customer.
(e) Repair Standards. The Grantee shall maintain a repair force of technicians who, under
normal operating conditions, are capable of responding to subscriber requests for service
within the following time frames:
(i) System Service Interruption: Under normal operating conditions, within two (2)

percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis.
(iii) Inferior Reception Quality: Within forty-eight (48) hours, including weekends,
of receiving a request for service identifying a problem concerning picture or
sound quality.
The Grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under
the provisions of this Section when a technician arrives at the service location or
5-1-21
contacts the customer by telephone and begins work on the problem. In the case
of a subscriber not being home when the technician arrives, response shall be
deemed to have taken place if the technician leaves written notification of
arrival.
(f) Notification of Service Interruption to Village Administrator. The Grantee shall
promptly notify the Village Administrator, in writing, or, if appropriate, by oral
communication, of any significant interruption in the operation of the system. For the
purposes of this Section, a “significant interruption in the operation of the system” shall
mean any interruption of sound or picture on one (1) or more channels of a duration of at
least twenty-four (24) hours to at least 5% of the subscribers.
(g) Subscriber Credit for Service Interruptions. Upon service interruption of the
subscriber’s cable service, the following shall apply:

SEC. 5-2-56 INTERCEPTOR AREA BENEFIT CONNECTION CHARGE.
(a) INTRODUCTION. It is the general public policy of the Village that new users
within the Village shall reasonably participate in the cost of existing interceptor
facilities at the time their lands actually receive sanitary sewer service.
Interceptor facilities are generally defined as all interceptors and related facilities
such as manholes and appurtenances, pumping stations and force mains. In
determining what constitutes reasonable participation toward such cost, the
Village shall be guided by the principle that the area to be served shall bear its
proportionate share of such costs. The cost of interceptor facilities in which new
users are required to participate are (i) cost reasonably and necessary incurred to
construct the sewage facilities to serve the new areas; and (ii) the cost of
providing excess capacity in the intercepting sewers until such time as the future
users in the new areas connect to the sanitary sewer system. Intercepting sewers
have an anticipated physical life of in excess of 50 years. This requires that they
be constructed of sufficient capacity to serve present users and future users. The
capacity required to serve future users is referred to as excess capacity. It is
more economical to construct interceptors with excess capacity as opposed to the
construction of parallel sewers, particularly because such interceptors are
initially constructed in largely undeveloped lands. It is reasonable that future
users, as well as present users, pay the total cost of the interceptor systems that
serve them. It would be unfair and unreasonable for a future user to pay only the
cost incurred at the time of the initial construction and not pay costs associated
with providing the excess capacity. The investment in excess capacity is made
for the future user’s benefit; and is not available for other uses by the Village.
Since future users make no payment until they connect to the sanitary sewer
system, only a part of the total cost of the interceptors can be collected when first
placed in service. The cost to be recovered at the time of initial construction
should be recovered through an “Interceptor Area Benefit Connection Charge”
against the new areas served.
(b) COMPUTATION OF INTERCEPTOR AREA BENEFIT CONNECTION
CHARGE. The cost of constructing sanitary interceptors varies with location
because of varying labor and material costs and general economic conditions.
Because each intercepting sewer has its unique service area, the cost to serve any
particular property varies according to the property's location relative to the
interceptor and the area that can be served by the interceptor. To reflect these
factors, the “Interceptor Area Benefit Connection Charge” (the “Charge”) shall
be computed in the following manner:
(1) The potential ultimate service area of the new interceptor shall be
determined primarily through the use of land use projections, with strong
reliance on adopted land use plans of any governmental authority have
appropriate jurisdiction thereof, and consistent with the regulations for
staging of interceptors as provided for in NR 110, Wis. Admin. Code.
The potential ultimate service area shall exclude wetlands or lands
excluded by duly adopted regional plans or land use plans.
(2) The capital cost of constructing the interceptor shall be determined.
When a new interceptor connects to an existing interceptor, a
proportionate share of the current replacement cost of the existing
interceptor facility, based upon stated use, shall be included as a capital
cost of the new interceptor.
5-2-17
(3) The total capital costs of constructing the new interceptor shall be
divided by the potential ultimate service area of the interceptor to arrive
at a cost per thousand square feet of area served. This rate shall be the
initial charge.
(4) The initial rate comprising the Charge shall be adjusted annually to
recover costs associated with providing excess capacity and to reflect the
benefit conferred upon and received by the new user. The amount of the
annual adjustment is such that the new user will pay an amount that
would build an equivalent sewer at the time the new user connects to the
system; and the Village will recover cost equivalent to its initial
investment.
(c) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT TO INTERCEPTOR AREA BENEFIT
CONNECTION CHARGE. The Charge shall be annually adjusted, based upon
the “Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index” (the “Index”), which
Index most closely reflects construction costs. The factors used in determining
construction costs include labor costs involved in constructing interceptors, such
as common labor, cement finisher, carpenter and medium equipment operator,
plus fringe benefits. They also include construction materials such as 3,000 psi
ready mixed concrete, 24-inch reinforced concrete pipe, 2 x 10 S4S (lowest
grade) lumber and paving asphalt. The base index is 100 for the year 1913.
Each interceptor shall be assigned a base index equal to the Index at the time of
construction of the interceptor. That base index is used in conjunction with the
most current index to adjust the initial Charge. The following example is
provided by way of explanation:
A Final Plat is approved by the Village Board, which Plat
contains a total area of 100 gross acres. The Plat contains 150
lots averaging 0.5 acres in size; streets and outlots constitute 15
acres; an environmental corridor and wetlands constitute 3 acres;
and a neighborhood park constitutes 5 acres. The Charge will be
assessed on 97 acres of the Final Plat (excludes the
environmental corridor/wetlands area). The Charge will be
collected upon approval of the Final Plat. Assume the Charge
was $13.98 per 1,000 square feet upon adoption of this
Ordinance (as listed under Sect 5-2-56(d)). The Index at the
time of adoption of this Ordinance was 6916. If the current
Index is 7220, then the current Charge is $14.59 per 1000/square
feet. Therefore, the total Charge for this 100-acre development
is $61,647.42.
(d) ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERCEPTOR AREA BENEFIT CONNECTION
CHARGES. The following Charges are established for the year 2004 in the
following amounts and for the following described interceptors; and such
charges shall be adjusted each calendar year thereafter, as provided for herein,
by means of a resolution duly adopted by the Village Board prior to December
31 of the year preceding the calendar year for which the adjustment is made.
Interceptor IABC Charges
(1) West Side Interceptor $13.98/1000 sq. feet (as of 3/2004)
(2) 13th Street Interceptor $13.98/1000 sq. feet (as of 3/2004)
(3) Water Street Interceptor $13.98/1000 sq. feet (as of 3/2004)
(e) APPLICATION OF INTERCEPTOR AREA BENEFIT CONNECTION
CHARGE. In collecting the Charges, the following shall apply:
5-2-18
(1) The Charge is imposed upon all lands, including municipally owned
lands, park lands, conservancy lands, lands designated as permanent
open space, as well as any other undeveloped areas; and the only lands
to be excluded there from are wetlands and lands permanently declared
as undevelopable by duly adopted plans of governmental authorities
having appropriate jurisdiction thereof.
(2) The Charge shall be computed on a net area basis for plats and certified
surveys, excluding public roads.
(3) In any case not covered by the policy statements contained in this
Section 5-2-56, the Village Board shall determine whether or not the
Charge shall be imposed as well as the amount thereof.
(f) USE OF INTERCEPTOR AREA BENEFIT CONNECTION CHARGE. The
Charges collected pursuant to this Section 5-2-56 shall be deposited into the
Village’s Sewerage Capital Funds Project Account and used primarily to pay for
the cost of cost of construction of additional sewerage facilities to serve all
users, or for debt service thereon.
(g) PAYMENT. The Charge shall be paid to the City Clerk upon the earlier of the
following events: (i) issuance of a permit for the connection of a building sewer
to a public sewer owned by the Village, which public sewer conveys wastewater
to the Interceptor in question; or (ii) the date of approval by the Village Board of
the Final Plat or the Certified Survey Map of a subdivision of a lot, parcel or
tract of land (which lot, parcel or tract is or will be served by the Interceptor in
question); and in this latter event, no later than the date of actual recording of the
Final Plat or Certified Survey Map at the Register of Deeds Office. A penalty of
1% per month shall be assessed on all such charges not paid at that time; and
such penalty shall continue until payment is made in full.

on the termination of the use of water, the payment of all charges levied against the
depositor, and the return of the wheel and reducer.
SEC. 5-5-28 SERVICE CONNECTIONS (OR WATER LATERALS).
(a) No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock
or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the
service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such
other insulation as may be approved by the superintendent. Service pipes passing through
curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space
or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space
between the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked
with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made impervious to
moisture.
(b) In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury
by carefully hand tamping the ground filling, free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or
other injurious material, around and at least six (6) inches over the pipe.
(c) All water supplies shall be of undiminished size and use copper (Type K) pipe
from the street main in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve
the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an
equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or
appliances operating simultaneously. All such service shall comply with the provisions
of the State Plumbing Code and shall be inspected by the Village Building Inspector.

SEC. 5-5-29 SERVICE PIPING FOR METER SETTINGS.
(a) In cases where a new customer whose service is to be metered installs the
original service piping or where an existing metered customer changes his service piping
for his own convenience, or where an existing flat rate customer requests to be metered,
the customer shall, at his expense, provide a suitable location and the proper connections
for the meter. The water superintendent should be consulted as to the type and size of
meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or other suitable place
within the building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a
union, and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to
the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the
superintendent (he may require a horizontal run of eighteen (18) inches in such pipe line)
which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line.
(b) No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service.
SEC. 5-5-30 TURNING ON WATER.
The water cannot be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized employee of
the utility. When a plumber has completed a job, he must leave the water turned off. This
does not prevent him from testing his work.
5-5-5
SEC. 5-5-31 FAILURE TO READ METERS.
(a) Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two (2) successive attempts, the
fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or
the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again
read, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or
cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill
for the amount of the minimum bill paid preceding month. Only in usual cases or where
approval is obtained from the customer shall more than two (2) consecutive estimated
bills be rendered.
(b) If the meter is damaged (see Surreptitious Use of Water) or fails to operate, the
bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is some reason why
the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be
estimated by some equitable method.
SEC. 5-5-32 COMPLAINT METER TESTS.
If a customer requests, the utility shall promptly make an accuracy test in addition to the
periodic or installation test if twenty-four (24) months or more has elapsed since the last
complaint test of the same meter in the same location. If less than twenty-four (24)
months has expired, there will be a charge as listed in the Schedule of Fees, payable in
advance. If the meter is found fast in excess of two (2%) percent, any payment that was
made for the test will be refunded and there will be an adjustment for past billings. (See
Wis. Adm. Code PSC Sections 185.61 through 185.78.)

and shut off the water in case of a leak on the consumer’s premises.
SEC. 5-5-35 INSTALLATION OF METERS.
Meters will be furnished and placed by the utility and are not to be disconnected or
tampered with by the consumer. All meters shall be so located that they shall be
protected from obstructions and permit ready access thereto for reading, inspection, and
servicing, such location to be designated or approved by the Director of Public
Works/Utilities. All piping within the building must be supplied and maintained by the
consumer. Where additional meters are desired by the consumer, he shall pay for all

and which at the time of the request for new service remains outstanding and not in
dispute.
(b) EXISTING RESIDENTIAL SERVICE. The utility may require a cash deposit or
other guarantee as a condition of continued service if, and only if, either or both the
following circumstances apply:
(1) Service has been shut off or discontinued within the last twelve (12)
months for violation of these rules and regulations or for nonpayment of a
delinquent bill for service which is not in dispute.
(2) Credit information obtained by the company subsequent to the initial
application indicates that the initial application for service was falsified or
incomplete to the extent that a deposit would be required under these rules and
regulations.
(c) COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SERVICE. If the credit for an applicant
for commercial or industrial service has not been established to the satisfaction of the
5-5-7
utility, he may be required to make a deposit or otherwise guarantee to the utility
payment of bills for service.
(d) CONDITIONS OF DEPOSIT. See Wis. Adm. Code, Chapter PSC 185.36(4).
(e) REFUNDS OF DEPOSITS. The utility shall review the payment record of each
residential customer with a deposit on file at not less than twelve (12) month intervals
and shall not require or continue to require a deposit unless a deposit could be required
under the conditions stated above. In the case of a commercial or industrial customer the
utility shall refund the deposit after twenty-four (24) consecutive months of prompt

reasonable written notice of the need therefor if such new or additional deposit could
have been required under the circumstances when the initial deposit was made. Service
may be refused or disconnected for failure to pay a deposit request as provided in the
rules. When service has been disconnected for failure to make a deposit, or for failure to
pay a delinquent bill, or for failure to comply with the terms of a Deferred Payment
Agreement, and satisfactory arrangements have been made to have service restored, a
reconnection charge as specified elsewhere in these rules, shall be paid by the customer
as a condition to restoration of service.

guarantor satisfactory to the company, whereby payment of a specified sum not
exceeding the cash deposit requirement is guaranteed. The term of the guarantee
contract shall be two (2) years, but shall automatically terminate after the
customer has closed his account, or at the guarantor’s request upon thirty (30)
days written notice to the utility.

with reasonable opportunity to remedy the situation.
(3) Failure to comply with deposit or guarantee arrangements as provided
for in these rules and regulations.
(4) Diversion of service around the meter.
(b) DISCONNECTION FOR DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.

disconnect notice which may be included with the bill for service. For the
purposes of this rule, the due date shall not be less than twenty (20) days after
issuance.
(2) The utility may disconnect without notice where a dangerous condition
exists for as long as the condition exists. Service may be denied to any customer
for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of the rules and
regulations of the Public Service Commission or of these rules and regulations,
or if a dangerous or unsafe condition exists on the customer’s premises.
(3) The utility shall notify the Sauk County Department of Health and Social
Services at least five (5) calendar days prior to any scheduled disconnection of
residential service of the customer or responsible person has made a written
request for this procedure. The utility shall apprise customers of this right upon
application of service. If service to a residential customer which has been
disconnected has not been restored within twenty-four (24) hours after
disconnection, the utility shall notify the appropriate county Sheriff’s
Department of the billing name and service address and that a threat to health
and life might exist to persons occupying the premises.
(c) DEFERRED PAYMENT AGREEMENT.
(1) The utility shall offer Deferred Payment Agreements to residential
customers. The Deferred Payment Agreement shall provide that service will not
be discontinued for the outstanding bill if the customer pays a stated reasonable
amount of the outstanding bill and agrees to pay a stated reasonable portion of
the remaining outstanding balance in installments until the bill is paid. In
determining what amounts are “reasonable,” the parties shall consider the:
a. Size of the delinquent account.
b. Customer’s ability to pay.
c. Customer’s payment history.
d. Time that the debt has been outstanding.
e. Reasons why the debt has been outstanding.
f. Any other relevant factors concerning the circumstances of the
customer.
(2) In the Deferred Payment Agreement it shall state immediately preceding
the space provided for the customer’s signature and in boldface print at least two
(2) sizes larger than any other used thereon, the following:
“IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT SIGN.
IF YOU DO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
DISPUTE THE AMOUNT DUE UNDER THE AGREEMENT EXCEPT FOR
THE UTILITY’S FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO FOLLOW THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.”
(3) A Deferred Payment Agreement shall not include a finance charge.
(4) If an applicant for service has not fulfilled the terms of a Deferred
Payment Agreement, the utility shall have the right to disconnect service or
5-5-9
refuse service in accordance with these rules under such circumstances, it shall
not be required to offer subsequent negotiation of a Deferred Payment
Agreement prior to disconnection.
(5) Any payments made by the customer in compliance with a Deferred
Payment Agreement, or otherwise, shall be first considered made in payment of
the previous account balance with any remainder credited to the current bill.
(d) DISPUTE PROCEDURES.
(1) Whenever the customer advises the utility’s designated office prior to
the disconnection of service that all or part of any billing as rendered is in
dispute, or that any matter related to the disconnection is in dispute, the company
shall investigate the dispute promptly and completely, advise the customer of the
results of the investigation, attempt to resolve the dispute, and provide the
opportunity for the customer to enter into a Deferred Payment Agreement when
applicable in order to settle the dispute.
(2) After the customer has pursued the available remedies with the utility, he
may request that the Public Service Commission’s staff informally review the
disputed issue and recommend the terms of settlement.
(3) Any party to the dispute after informal review may make a written
request for a formal review by the Commission. If the Commission decides to
conduct a formal hearing on the dispute, the customer must pay fifty (50) percent
of the bill in dispute or post a bond for that amount on or before the hearing
date. Failure to pay the amount or posted the bond will constitute a waiver of
the right to a hearing. Service shall not be disconnected because of any disputed
matter while the disputed matter is being pursued under the disputes procedure.
In no way does this relieve the customer from the obligation of paying charges
which are not disputed.
5-5-10

SEC. 5-6-1 PURPOSE AND NECESSITY; AUTHORIZATION.
The Board of Trustees for the Village of Prairie du Sac ("Village") finds that the management of
stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the Wisconsin River and other
bodies of water adjacent to the Village is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the
Village, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively
manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the Village by, amount other
things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface
water runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage,
and create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and
adjacent to the Village. A system for the collection and disposal of stormwater provides services
to all properties within the Village and surrounding areas, including those properties not currently
served by the system. The cost of operating and maintaining the Village stormwater management
system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof
should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the
system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the Village Board hereby
exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater
management services. In promulgating the regulations contained in this chapter, the Village is
acting pursuant to authority granted by chapters 61 and 66 of the Wisconsin Statutes, including,
but not limited to, sections 61.34, 61.36, 61.39, 66.0809, 66.0811, 66.0821.
SEC. 5-6-2 CREATION.
There is hereby established a stormwater utility in the Village of Prairie du Sac. Operation of the
stormwater utility shall be under the supervision of the Public Works/Utilities Committee of the
Village Board.

SEC. 6-1-7 REGULATION OF LENGTH OF LAWN AND GRASSES.
(a) PURPOSE. This section is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated
with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the
Village of Prairie du Sac.
(b) PUBLIC NUISANCE DECLARED. The Village Board finds that lawns, grasses and
noxious weeds on lots or parcels of land which exceed eight (8) inches in length adversely
affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and other
discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can
be hidden in the grass, interferes with the public convenience and adversely affects
property values of other land within the Village. For that reason, any lawn, grass or weed
on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds eight (8) inches in length is hereby declared
to be a public nuisance, except for property located in a designated floodplain area and/or
wetland area or where the lawn, grass or weed is part of a natural lawn approved pursuant
to Section 6-1-6 above.
(c) NUISANCES PROHIBITED. No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public
nuisance as defined in subsection (b) above to remain on any premises owned or controlled
by him within the Village.
(d) INSPECTION. The Weed Commissioner or his designee shall inspect or cause to be
inspected all premises and places within the Village to determine whether any public
nuisance as defined in subsection (b) above exists.
(e) ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE.
(1) If the Weed Commissioner or his designee shall determine with reasonable
certainty that any public nuisance as defined in subsection (b) above exists, he
shall immediately serve written notice that the Village proposes to have the lot
grass or lawn cut so as to conform with this Section and Section 6-1-5.
(2) The notice shall be served at least five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing, if
so requested under (f), and shall be mailed or served on the owner of the lot or
parcel of land, or, if he is not known and there is a tenant occupying the property,
then to the tenant, of the time and place at which the hearing will be held.
(3) If a notice has been so served as aforesaid and if the owner has not requested a
hearing as provided for in (f) below or the Public Works/Utilities Committee, after
hearing, has determined that such a public nuisance exists, then, in any such
events, any further violations of Sec. 6 1 7 occurring during the balance of the
calendar year within which the violation occurred, shall result in a doubling of the
fines hereinafter imposed and such owner is deemed to be a repeat offender.
(f) DUE PROCESS HEARING. If the owner believes that his grasses or weeds are not a
nuisance, he may request a hearing before the Public Works/Utilities Committee. The
request for said hearing must be made in writing to the Village Administrator’s office
within the five (5) days set forth in the Weed Commissioner’s notice. Upon application for
the hearing, the property owner must deposit a fifty dollar ($50.00) bond. If a decision is
rendered in the property owner’s favor, the fifty dollars ($50.00) will be returned to the
property owner. If the property owner fails to appear for the hearing or of the decision is
rendered against the property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited and applied to the cost
of Village personnel abating the nuisance, if necessary. When a hearing is requested by the
owner of the property, a hearing by the Public Works/Utilities Committee shall be held
within five (5) days from the date of the owner’s request. The property in question will not
6-1-7
be mowed by the Village until such time as the hearing is held by the Public
Works/Utilities Committee. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his
attorney, may present witnesses in his own behalf and may cross-examine witnesses
presented by the Village as well as subpoena witnesses for his own case. At the close of
the hearing, the Public Works/Utilities Committee shall make its determination in writing
specifying its findings, facts, and conclusions. If the Public Works/Utilities Committee
determines that a public nuisance did exist, the Committee shall order the Weed
Commissioner to mow the property in question unless the property has been mowed by the
owner within forty-eight (48) hours of the Public Works/Utilities Committee’s decision. If
the owner does not abate the nuisance within the described forty-eight (48) hours, the
Weed Commissioner shall cause the same nuisance to be abated and cost in excess of the
forfeited fee assessed accordingly.
(g) VILLAGE’S OPTION TO ABATE NUISANCE. In any case where the owner, occupant
or person in charge of the property shall fail to cut his lawn, grass or weeds as set forth
above, then, and in that event, the Village may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as
follows:
(1) The written notice required in Subsection (e) shall inform said person that in the
event of his failure to abate the nuisance within the prescribed time, the Village
shall abate the same and the cost thereof shall be assessed to the property owner as
a special charge.
(2) The Village shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject’s
property and shall charge the expenses of so doing at a rate as established by
resolution by the Village Board. The charges shall be set forth in a statement to the
Village Administrator who, in turn, shall mail the same to the owner, occupant or
person in charge of the subject premises. If said statement is not paid in full within
thirty (30) days thereafter, the Village Administrator shall enter the charges in the
tax roll as a special tax against said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be
collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate, or as provided under Sec.
66.615(3)(f), Wisconsin Statutes.
(h) FINE. Any person violating the provisions of Sec. 6 1 7(b) hereof shall pay a forfeiture of
$75.00 for each violation, and each day that the grass exceeds the eight (8) inch limit as
specified in (b) above shall be deemed a separate violation. All such forfeitures shall be
recoverable by the Village in the manner provided for forfeitures generally. Such
forfeiture is due in all cases, unless the Public Works/Utilities Committee has determined
pursuant to (f) above that no public nuisance existed as of the date the notice required
under (e) was given.

SEC. 7-2-19 FORFEITURE AND REVOCATION OF LICENSES FOR ESTABLISHMENTS
PROVIDING ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.
(a) LEGISLATIVE INTENT. The Village Board does hereby find:
(1) The Village Board of the Village of Prairie du Sac has authority under
Wisconsin Statutes Section 125.10(1) to adopt regulations governing the
sale of alcoholic beverages, which regulations are in addition to those set
forth in Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 125, and
13
(2) The Village Board has authority under its general police powers set forth
in Wisconsin Statutes Section 61.34(1) to act for the good order of the
municipality and for the health, safety and welfare of the public; and may
carry out its powers by regulation and suppression; and
(3) The Village Board does not intend by adopting this ordinance to regulate
obscenity, since nudity in itself is not obscene, it therefore declares its
intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live,
totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns; and
(4) Bars and taverns featuring live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing
have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal and
other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and order of the communities,
to depreciate the value of real property, to harm the economic welfare of
the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the
communities, and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public
health, safety and general welfare of the citizens; and
(5) The Village Board recognizes the U.S. Supreme Court has held that nude
dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to
some limited protection under the First Amendment, and the Village
Board further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most
precious and highly protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with
full protection of those rights.
(6) However, the Village Board is aware, based on the experiences of other
communities, that bars and taverns in which live, totally nude, nonobscene,
erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects
which the Village Board believes are detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Prairie du Sac; and
(7) Among these secondary effects are (i) the potential increase in prostitution
and other sex-related offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses, (ii)
the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars
and taverns featuring nude dancing exist, (iii) health risks associated with
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and (iv) the potential
infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct; and
(8) The Village Board desires to minimize, prevent and control these adverse
effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of the Village of Prairie du Sac; protect the citizens from
increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values
and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban
blight; and
14
(9) The Village Board has determined that enactment of an ordinance
prohibiting live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing in bars and
taverns licensed to serve alcoholic beverages promotes the goal of
minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects
associated with such activity.
(b) DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Section, the term “licensed establishment”
means any establishment licensed by the Village Board to sell alcoholic beverages
pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 125.
(c) NUDE DANCING IN LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED. It is
unlawful for any person to perform or engage in, or for any licensee or manager
or agent of the licensee to permit any person, employee, entertainer, or patron to
perform or engage in any live act, demonstration, dance or exhibition on the
premises of a licensed establishment which:
(1) Shows his or her genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, anal clef or cleavage
with less than a fully opaque covering; or
(2) Shows any portion of the female breast below a point immediately above
the top of the areola; or
(3) Shows the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.
(d) EXEMPTIONS. The provisions of this Section do not apply to the following
licensed establishments; theaters, performing arts center, civic centers, and dinner
theaters where live dance, ballet, music and dramatic performances of serious
artistic merit are offered on a regular basis and in which the predominant business
or attraction is not the offering to customers of entertainment which is intended to
provide sexual stimulation or sexual gratification to such customers and where the
establishment is not distinguished by an emphasis on, or the advertising or
promotion of, employees engaging in nude erotic dancing.
(e) PENALTIES. Any person, partnership, or corporation who violates any of the
provisions of this Section shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100.00,
and not more than $500 per violation occurs and continues. In addition, violation
of this ordinance constitutes sufficient grounds for suspending, revoking, or nonrenewing
an alcohol beverage license under Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 125.
(f) SEVERABILITY. If any part of this Section is found to be unconstitutional or
otherwise invalid, the validity of the remaining sections will not be affected.
(g) EFFECTIVE DATE. This Section shall take effect upon passage and publication
as required by law.
SEC. 7-2-20 PENALTIES.
15
(a) Forfeitures for violations of Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 125 shall conform to the
forfeiture penalty permitted to be imposed for violations of the comparable state
statutes, including any variations or increases for subsequent offenses.
(b) Any person who shall violate any provision of this Chapter of the Code of
Ordinances of the Village of Prairie due Sac, Wisconsin, except as otherwise
provided in subsection (1) herein, or who shall conduct any activity or make any
sale for which a license is required without such license, shall be subject to a
forfeiture as provided in the general penalty section of this Code.
(c) Nothing herein shall preclude or affect the power of the sentencing court to
exercise additional authorities granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.
SEC. 7-2-21 FEES.
The fees for all licenses described in this Chapter 2 shall be established by a majority
vote of the Village Board, from time to time, and set forth in a Schedule of Fees. All

notice must be sent by registered mail to, or served upon, the applicant
within ten (10) days of the Village Clerk’s denial of the matter. The

procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest
or conviction of at least two (2) offenses which are substantially related to the
licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding the license
application. Because a license is a privilege, the Village Clerk and the Village
Board reserves the right to consider the severity, and facts and circumstances of
the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a license.
Further, the Village Board and the Village Clerk, at their discretion, may, based
upon an arrest or conviction record of two (2) or more offenses which are
substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately
preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one (1) year or more.

SEC 9-2-18 POSSESSION OF SYNTHETIC CANNABOID PROHIBITED
(a) Findings. The Village Board of the Village of Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, has
determined that herbal preparations powdered or sprayed with a chemical
synthetic cannabinoid are available for sale in the Sauk County area that claim to
produce intoxicating effects similar to THC or marijuana. While the substances
are not yet categorized as illegal controlled substances under Wisconsin or
federal law, several other countries, states and municipalities have already taken
action to prohibit these substances due to increased overdoses and other negative
health concerns. While these synthetic cannabinoid substances are often
marketed as benign and legal alternatives to marijuana, they are potentially
dangerous to users as the substances can create potency from 3 up to 100 times
greater than marijuana, produce severe adverse health conditions such as
hallucinations, paranoia, seizures, and vomiting based on reported emergency
room experiences in areas of the country where use is more prevalent, and further
that long term health effects of use of these substances are not yet known. It has
been determined that the effects of these substances are a health, safety, and
welfare concern to the citizens of the Village of Prairie du Sac;
(b) Possession, Use and Sale are Prohibited. It shall be illegal for any person to use,
possess, transport, purchase, attempt to purchase, sell, publically display for sale
or attempt to sell, give trade or barter any one or more of the following chemicals
whether under the common street names of “Spice,” “K2,” “Genie,” “Yucatan
Fire,” “fake” or “new” marijuana, or by any other name, label or description:
(1) Salviadivinorum or salvinorum A; all parts of the plant presently
classified botanically as salvia divinorum, whether growing or not, the
seeds thereof; any extract from any part of such plant, and every
compound, manufacture, salts derivative, mixture or preparation of such
plant, its seeds or extracts;
(2) (6aR, 10aR)-9-(hydroxymethyl)-6, 6dimethyl-3-(2methyloctan-2-yl)-6a,
7, 10, 10a-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chromen-1-ol some trade or other names:

not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00, exclusive of costs.

SEC 9-2-19 CHILD SEX OFFENDER RESTRICTIONS
(a) FINDINGS. The Village Board of the Village of Prairie du Sac,
Wisconsin, has determined that there is a risk that persons convicted of a
sexual offense against a child may re-offend in locations close to where
children tend to congregate. Due to the high rate of recidivism for child
sexual offenders, reducing the opportunity and temptation is important to
minimizing the risk of re-offense. Accordingly, there is a need to protect
children where they congregate or play in public places. Therefore, it is
the intent of this Ordinance is to serve the Village’s compelling interest
to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the
children of the Village of Prairie du Sac by prohibiting convicted sexual
offenders from loitering or being present in specified areas around
locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers.
In addition to schools and daycare centers, the Village finds and declares
that children congregate or play at child-oriented facilities, such as parks
and playgrounds and libraries. This Ordinance also recognizes that
convicted sexual offenders must reenter the community and the Village
of Prairie du Sac accepts that it has a responsibility to convicted sexual
offenders and the surrounding area municipalities to ensure that its
regulatory measures are not aimed at prohibiting convicted sexual
offenders from being part of this society. This Ordinance is not intended
to be a criminal penalty.
(b) DEFINITIONS. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in

preserve in the long-term agricultural lands, agricultural uses, and open space, as detailed and for
such timeframe specified in the Comprehensive Plan, Sauk Prairie Intergovernmental Cooperation
Agreement, and Sauk County Farmland Preservation Plan. The A-P district allows for a wider range
of Agricultural and Related Land Uses than the A-T and A-H districts, where lands so zoned may be
converted for urban development sooner than A-P zoned areas. The A-P district is a certified
farmland preservation zoning district under Chapter 91, Wisconsin Statutes.
(2) Allowable Land Uses (per Article 3). Allowable principal, accessory, and temporary land uses
permitted by right and by conditional use permit in the A-P district are indicated in Figure 10-1-0307.

Districts
ARTICLE 2: ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 2-3
(3) Density, Intensity, and Bulk Regulations (per Article 4). Structures and site development shall comply
with the Density, Intensity, and Bulk regulations for the A-P district in Figure 10-1-0402(a) and
Figure 10-1-0402 (b), and shall be subject to the general density, intensity, and bulk regulations of
Article 4.
(4) Overlay District Requirements (per Article 5). All lots, uses, structures, and site features within one
or more Overlay Zoning Districts shall be subject to the use and bulk requirements of all applicable
Overlay Zoning District requirements in addition to those of the underlying A-P district. Where A-P
and Overlay District requirements conflict, or the requirements of different overlay districts conflict,
the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
(5) Other Requirements.
a. Building and Site Design Standards. Land uses and development shall conform with applicable
building and site design requirements of Section 10-1-0602. Agricultural uses and structures are
exempt from these requirements.
b. Landscaping and Green Space Regulations. Land uses and development shall conform with
applicable landscaping requirements of Section 10-1-0701. Except for screening requirements

d. Signs. All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of Article 9.
e. Nonconforming lots, uses, structures, and sites. Any non-conforming situation shall comply with
the requirements of Article 12.
(b) A-H Agricultural Holding District.
(1) Description and Purpose. The A-H Agricultural Holding District is intended to preserve lands in
agricultural lands and open space until ripe for planned urban development. The Comprehensive
Plan and Sauk Prairie Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement specify the desired type of urban
development and permitted timeframe for such development in areas zoned A-H. Rezoning from AH
to another district, extension of public utilities and services, and annexation to the Village must
occur in advance of urban development. Because lands in the A-H district are not expected to
develop with urban uses as soon as lands zoned A-T, a slightly broader range of Agricultural and
Related Land Uses is allowed in the A-H district.
(2) Allowable Land Uses (per Article 3). Allowable principal, accessory, and temporary land uses
permitted by right and by conditional use permit in the A-H district are indicated in Figure 10-1-
0307. Allowable uses shall be subject to the use regulations applicable to all land uses (Section 10-1-

Overlay Zoning District requirements in addition to those of the underlying A-H district. Where AH
and Overlay District requirements conflict, or the requirements of different overlay districts
conflict, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
(5) Other Requirements.
a. Building and Site Design Standards. Land uses and development shall conform with applicable
building and site design requirements of Section 10-1-0602. Agricultural uses and structures are
exempt from these requirements.
b. Landscaping and Green Space Regulations. Land uses and development shall conform with
applicable landscaping requirements of Section 10-1-0701. Except for screening requirements
specifically required by Article 3, agricultural uses and structures are exempt from these
requirements. All Permanently Green Space Areas and Protected Natural Resource Areas as
defined in this Chapter shall be subject to the requirements of Article 7.
c. Performance Standards. Land uses and development shall comply with applicable performance
standards of Article 8. Except where the application of performance standards in Article 8 is
specifically made applicable to agricultural and single- and two-family residential uses in this
Article, agricultural and single- and two-family residential uses and structures are exempt from
these requirements (but residential subdivisions are not exempt).

lands and open space for near-term urban development. As detailed the Comprehensive Plan and
Sauk Prairie Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement, annexation and urban development may
occur in areas zoned A-T at any time at the request of property owners. Rezoning from A-T to
another district, extension of public utilities and services, and annexation to the Village must occur in
advance of urban development. Because the A-T district is contiguous to developed lands within the
Village, the range of allowable land uses in advance of urban development is the narrowest of the
agricultural districts.
(2) Allowable Land Uses (per Article 3). Allowable principal, accessory, and temporary land uses
permitted by right and by conditional use permit in the A-T district are indicated in Figure 10-1-0307.
Allowable uses shall be subject to the use regulations applicable to all land uses (Section 10-1-0301
and 10-1-0302) and those applicable to the individual uses established in Section 10-1-0310.
(3) Density, Intensity, and Bulk Regulations (per Article 4). Structures and site development shall comply
with the Density, Intensity, and Bulk regulations for the A-T district in Figure 10-1-0402(a) and
Figure 10-1-0402 (b), and shall be subject to the general density, intensity, and bulk regulations of
Article 4.
(4) Overlay District Requirements (per Article 5). All lots, uses, structures, and site features within one
or more Overlay Zoning Districts shall be subject to the use and bulk requirements of all applicable
Overlay Zoning District requirements in addition to those of the underlying A-T district Where A-T
and Overlay District requirements conflict, or the requirements of different overlay districts conflict,

Even if a land use may be indicated as permitted by right or requiring a conditional use in a particular district,
such a land use may not necessarily be permitted or permissible on any or every property in such district. No
land use is permitted or permissible on a property unless it can be located or implemented on it in full
compliance with all of the applicable standards and regulations of this Chapter, or unless an appropriate
variance has been granted pursuant to Section 10-1-1309.
(a) Principal Land Uses Permitted by Right. Principal land uses listed as permitted by right (designated

(p) Large Retail and Commercial Service Developments.
(1) Description. A Large Retail and Commercial Service Development is a development comprised of

multiple such enterprises within which the total combined Gross Floor Area of all indoor retail
and/or commercial activities, associated enclosed storage, and associated outdoor display exceeds
20,000 square feet. The requirements of this Section are applicable to all new Large Retail and

parking, or storage areas that are part of an approved Large Retail and Commercial Service
Development shall require an amendment to the Conditional Use Permit.
b. Subsequent changes to individual land uses listed as permitted uses within the applicable zoning
district are permitted without amendment to the Large Retail and Commercial Development
Conditional Use Permit, unless said Conditional Use Permit placed restrictions on change of use.
c. Subsequent individual land uses allowed only Conditional Use Permit in the zoning district may
be allowed only under subsequent Conditional Use Permit for the specific use, regardless of
whether said use entails modifications to the building and/or site layout.
d. Large Retail and Commercial Service Developments are subject to all of the use and other
regulations of the applicable zoning district or other parts of this Chapter and Large Retail and
Commercial Developments shall comply with all of the requirements of Section 10-1-0605.

Section 10-1-0310: Detailed Land Use Descriptions and Regulations
The land use categories employed by this Chapter are defined in this Section. Land use categories which are
not listed in this Chapter are not necessarily excluded from locating within any given zoning district. Section
10-1-1310 empowers the Zoning Administrator to make interpretations on matters regarding specific land use
proposals which are not addressed by this Chapter.
(a) Residential Land Uses.
(1) Single-Family Detached. A Single-Family Detached dwelling unit is designed for and occupied by not
more than one family and having no roof, wall, or floor in common with any other dwelling unit.
This dwelling unit type consists of a fully detached Single-Family residence which is located on an
individual lot. The dwelling unit must be a site built structure built in compliance with the State of
Wisconsin Uniform Dwelling Code (UDC), or may be a manufactured dwelling (modular home) as
permitted by the UDC or a manufactured home that has received a Federal Manufactured Housing
Certificate label.
Regulations:
a. The minimum Gross Floor Area floor shall be 700 square feet, exclusive of an attached garage,
carport, or open deck.
b. The dwelling must be attached to a finished, permanent foundation, such as a poured concrete
slab or basement meeting UDC requirements.
c. The dwelling unit roof shall have a pitch of at least 3 feet in rise for every 12 feet in run, except
by Conditional Use Permit.
d. This dwelling unit type may not be split into two or more dwelling units, except for In-Family
Suites meeting the requirements of this Article.
e. Minimum Required Parking: 2 spaces.
(2) Two-Family (Duplex). This dwelling unit type consists of a single structure with two separate
residences, each having a private individual access, and no shared internal access within the building.
Duplexes can be constructed as attached side-by-side units each with a ground floor and roof, or as a
two-story structure with one unit above the other. Where side-by-side, each duplex dwelling unit may
share the same lot or be located on a separate lot per the applicable standards that follow.
Regulations:
a. The structure must be in complete compliance with the State of Wisconsin Uniform Dwelling
Code (UDC).
b. A building code required fire rated wall must separate the two dwelling units from the lowest
level to flush against the underside of the roof.
c. Individual sanitary sewer and public water laterals and utility meters are required for each
dwelling unit.
d. For duplexes proposed to be built as or converted to zero-lot line structures:
1. The common wall between the units shall meet UDC requirements from the basement floor
to the top of the roof. Compliance shall be confirmed by the building inspector.
2. The developer shall provide, with the Zoning Permit or Building Permit application, a signed
agreement or covenant specifying maintenance standards for the common wall, maintenance
and replacement standards for exterior surfaces of the building to maintain a neat and
harmonious appearance over time, maintenance standards for any common sewer lateral and
any other common features, and restrictions against construction of detached single family
residences on any of the affected lots in the event either or all sides of the zero lot line

construction dwelling are destroyed. Such agreement or covenant shall also provide that it
may not be terminated, amended or otherwise altered without the approval of the Village
Board. Such agreement shall be subject to Zoning Administrator approval, and then
recorded by the developer against all affected properties and continually maintained by the
property owners.
3. See also Figures 10-1-403(b) and 10-1-403(d).
e. Minimum Required Parking: 2 spaces per dwelling unit.
(3) Townhouse. A Townhouse consists of three to eight attached Single-Family residences, each having
a private, individual access. Each dwelling unit shares at least one common wall with an adjacent
dwelling unit. Each townhouse unit may share the same lot or be located on a separate lot per the
standards that follow.
Regulations:
a. Any Townhouse structure shall meet the design standards for Multi-Family Residences as
established in Section 10-1-0602, and are subject to Site Plan Review as established in Section 10-
1-1307.
b. Only one townhouse structure is permitted per zoned lot unless approved as part of a Group

accommodate the collocation of two additional antenna arrays similar in size and function to that
placed on the tower by the applicant. Collocation sites need not be available on the tower as
initially placed or constructed, provided that the tower will support the later addition of the
required number of collocation sites. The holder of each permit shall make the collocation sites
required hereunder available for the placement of technologically compatible antenna arrays and
equipment upon contractual provisions that are standard in the industry and at prevailing market
rates allowing the permit holder to recoup the cost of providing the collocation sites and a fair
return on investment.
e. Each communication tower and associated equipment shall, to the extent determined possible by
the Zoning Administrator, match the color of existing facilities and be installed in a fashion to
lessen the visual impacts of such installation. Accessory buildings, if required, shall be
constructed to be compatible with the surrounding or adjacent buildings by virtue of their
design, materials, textures, and colors.
f. In conjunction with the installation of new communication towers and ground mounted
buildings or equipment totaling 300 square feet or greater, the applicant shall provide a
bufferyard meeting the requirements of Section 10-1-0701(c)(4) along all property borders
abutting residentially zoned property. Other landscaping requirements of Article 7 shall also
apply.
g. A new or amended conditional use permit and site plan shall be required for a “substantial
modification” to an existing communication tower. Neither a conditional use permit nor site
plan approval shall be required for any modification including collocation that is not defined as a
“substantial modification,” but a building permit shall be required.
h. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a communications tower, the applicant shall
provide a written agreement stating that if the communications tower, antennas, or transmitters
are unused for a period exceeding 12 months, the applicant shall remove the tower, antennas, or
transmitters upon written request from the Zoning Administrator at no cost to the Village within
60 days of such request. If such listed items are not removed within 60 days of such notification,
the Village may remove the items at the expense of the holder of the conditional use permit.
Within 30 days of the date on which the tower use ceases, the permit holder shall provide the
Village with written notice of the cessation of use. A performance bond or deposit of $20,000
shall be required to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements for removal of the
communications tower and equipment.
i. The owner of any communications tower shall maintain insurance against liability for personal
injury, death, or property damage caused by the use, maintenance, operation and/or failure of
the communications tower and accessory structures with a single combined limit of not less than
$1,000,000.00 per occurrence. The policy shall contain a provision that it may not be canceled or
materially modified without the approval of the Village. The owner shall provide the Village with
a certificate of such insurance before issuance of a building permit and upon each policy renewal
thereafter.
j. Upon written inquiry from the Village, the recipient of a conditional use permit under this
subsection shall have the burden of presenting credible evidence establishing the continued
compliance with the approved plans and all conditions placed upon the conditional use permit.
Failure to establish compliance with the approved plans and all conditions placed upon the
conditional use permit shall be grounds for revocation of the permit. If the Village determines
that it is necessary to consult with a third party to ascertain compliance with conditions on a
conditional use permit, all costs and expenses associated with such consultation shall be borne by
the holder of subject conditional use permit, except for travel expenses. Failure to pay such costs

Airport District Density, Intensity, and Bulk Standards
ARTICLE 4: DENSITY, INTENSITY, BULK REGULATIONS 4-1
ARTICLE 4: DENSITY, INTENSITY, BULK REGULATIONS
Section 10-1-0400: Purpose
The purpose of this Article is to establish base density, intensity, and dimensional requirements for each
Standard Zoning District. These measures include minimum lot areas and lot widths; measures of intensity of
allowable improvements such as residential densities, building coverage, building height, landscape surface
ratios and floor area ratios, and the allowable locations of structures and other improvements within a zoned
lot though minimum setback and separation requirements. The actual development potential of any site is
determined by a variety of other factors, including but not limited to: 1) the area and configuration of the site;
2) the proportion of the site containing protected natural resources; 3) applicable design standards found
elsewhere in this Chapter.
Section 10-1-0401: How to Use This Article
(a) This Article contains the base standards which determine the maximum amount of development
permitted on a given site, excluding consideration for applicable natural resource protection and design
requirements and necessary public right-of-way. This Article recognizes inherent potential differences
between agricultural, residential, and nonresidential land uses, and thus regulates their development in
slightly different manners. Requirements for Agricultural and Conservancy Zoning Districts are found in
Figures 10-1-0402(a) and 10-1-0402(b). Requirements for Residential Zoning Districts are found in
Figures 10-1-0403(a) and 10-1-0403(b). Requirements for Business, Office, Manufacturing, Institutional
and Airport Zoning Districts are found in Figures 10-1-0404(a) and 10-1-0404(b). Planned Unit
Development District and Traditional Neighborhood Development District requirements are addressed
in Article 10 and Article 11 respectively.
(b) The density, intensity and bulk regulations set forth in this Article collectively represent the minimum
standards and maximum potential for site utilization in a given district. Other regulations set forth in this
Chapter and elsewhere in this Title may effectively reduce the density, intensity, and bulk of structures
permitted on a given property.
Section 10-1-0402: Agricultural and Conservancy District Density, Intensity, and Bulk Standards
Except where expressly indicated, all lots and improvements within the Agricultural and Conservancy districts
shall comply with the standards prescribed in Figures 10-1-0402(a) and 10-1-0402(b). Allowable Yard Setback
Adjustments, Intrusions into Required Yards, and Exceptions to Maximum Height are found in Section 10-1-
0411 through Section 10-1-0415. Substandard Lots, Nonconforming Uses, Nonconforming Structures, and
Nonconforming sites legally created before establishment of these requirements are addressed in Article 12.
Section 10-1-0403: Residential District Density, Intensity, and Bulk Standards
All lots and improvements within Residential zoning districts shall comply with the standards prescribed in
Figures 10-1-0403(a) and 10-1-0403(b). Allowable Yard Setback Adjustments, Intrusions into Required Yards,
and Exceptions to Maximum Height are found in Section 10-1-0411 through Section 10-1-0415. Substandard
Lots, Nonconforming Uses, Nonconforming Structures, and Nonconforming sites legally created before
establishment of these requirements are addressed in Article 12.
Section 10-1-0404: Business, Manufacturing, Institutional, and Airport District Density, Intensity,
and Bulk Standards
All lots and improvements within Business, Manufacturing, Institutional, and Airport zoning districts created
under the provisions of this Chapter shall comply with the standards prescribed in Figures 10-1-0404(a) and
10-1-0404(b). Allowable Yard Setback Adjustments, Intrusions into Required Yards, and Exceptions to

Section 10-1-0411: Yard Setback Adjustments
(a) Limitations on Yard Setback Adjustments.
(1) No yard shall be reduced in area or dimension so as to make such yard less than the minimum
required by this Chapter. If an existing yard is less than the minimum required, it shall not be reduced
further, except where exempted by the provisions of this Section.
(2) No required yard or lot area allocated to satisfy the minimum yard or lot area requirements for one
building or structure shall be used to satisfy the minimum yard or lot area requirement for another
building or structure.
(b) Side and Rear Yard Adjustments for Bufferyards. In instances where a bufferyard required per
Section 10-1-0701 exceeds the minimum required setback width, the minimum required bufferyard width
shall prevail. Absolutely no intrusions by a structure, outdoor storage, or paved motor vehicle
accommodation areas are permitted within any required bufferyard.
(c) Front Yard Setback and Corner Lot Street Side Setback Adjustment. The front yard setbacks shall
be adjusted as follows when the described conditions or circumstances exist:
(1) For lots located adjacent to a street with an Officially Mapped or existing right-of-way equal to or
exceeding 100 feet, 40 feet of setback is required to address anticipated future conditions of noise
and air quality.
(2) The required front yard setback for a principal structure may be reduced on any lot where more than
50 percent of the same type of principal structure on the same block face does not meet the required
front yard setback. In such instances, the required front yard setback for the proposed structure shall
be the average of all the same-type principal structures on said block face.
Section 10-1-0412: Intrusions into Required Yards
(a) The minimum setbacks listed in Figures 10-1-0402(b), 10-1-0403(b), and 10-1-0404(b) establish the

ARTICLE 5: OVERLAY DISTRICTS 5-1
ARTICLE 5: OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Section 10-1-0500: Purpose
The purpose of this Article is to establish Overlay Zoning Districts wherein certain additional requirements
are superimposed on the underlying Standard Zoning Districts set forth in Article 2 of this Chapter. Each
Overlay District is intended to address a special land use circumstance beyond those addressed by the
underlying zoning district. Special requirements include mandatory protections against natural hazards,
mandatory protections of valued natural resources, special design guidelines, and measures to ensure
compatibility with airport flight operations. Each Overlay District is intended to implement one or more
aspects of the Comprehensive Plan, ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements, or both.
Section 10-1-0501: How to Use this Article
(a) A given property may lie within one or more Overlay Districts, based on its geographic location. The
provisions of this Article shall be consulted before issuance of any building permit, site plan approval,
conditional use permit, zoning permit, zoning change, or land division to ensure the intended use meets
all of the requirements of any applicable Overlay District.
(b) For each Overlay District established in this Article, a definition of the resource or geographic area is
provided, followed by the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing the resource or
geographic location, the method of delineating the boundaries of the Overlay District (also as typically
depicted on the Official Overlay Zoning District map), and the associated development regulations or
references.
Section 10-1-0502: Overview of Overlay Zoning Districts
(a) For the purpose of this Chapter, the following Overlay Districts are described:

Sac Code of Ordinances in addition to requirements of the underlying Standard Zoning District, any
other applicable Overlay District, and other requirements of this Chapter.
Section 10-1-0504: SP Shoreland Protection District
(a) Description and Purpose. The Sauk County Shoreland Protection Ordinance fulfills Wisconsin
shoreland protection mandates through its Shoreland District and Shoreland-Wetland District. Pursuant
to Wisconsin Statutes, all territory annexed by the Village after May 7, 1982 is subject to the Sauk County
Shoreland Protection Ordinance, unless the Village were to adopt a shoreland protection ordinance as
restrictive or more restrictive than the County’s. The Village has elected not to adopt a separate
ordinance. Therefore, within applicable lands annexed after May 7, 1982, the Village enforces the
provisions of the Sauk County Shoreland Protection Ordinance. Sauk County continues to be responsible
for administration of the Sauk County Shoreland Protection Ordinance for all territory outside of the
Village limits, including within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction.
(b) Shoreland Protection District Boundaries. The SP Shoreland Protection District includes all territory
within the Sauk County Shoreland District.

of the Sauk County Shoreland Protection Ordinance, as from time to time amended by Sauk County,
The Village shall administer such regulations within applicable lands annexed to the Village after May
7, 1982, the County shall administer such regulations in the unincorporated area, and there shall be
no such regulations for all lands within the Village on May 7, 1982
(2) The requirements of the underlying Standard Zoning District, other Overlay Districts and other
requirements of this Chapter shall also apply. Where requirements of this Section and other
provisions of this Chapter conflict, the most restrictive shall apply.
Section 10-1-0505: LWR Lower Wisconsin Riverway District
(a) Description and Purpose. Lands, shorelands, and waterways under the jurisdiction the Lower
Wisconsin State Riverway shall be subject to all requirements established under Wisconsin Statutes and
administered by the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway Board. Any applicant for a building permit or
zoning permit shall first be required to demonstrate compliance with all applicable Lower Wisconsin
State Riverway procedures and requirements before the Village issues such permit(s).
Section 10-1-0506: WHP Wellhead Protection District
(a) Description and Purpose. The Village and its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction depend exclusively on
ground water for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and activities can seriously
threaten or degrade ground water quality. The purpose of this Section is to institute land use regulations
and restrictions to protect the Village’s municipal water supply and well fields, and to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents, employees, and visitors of the Village. The restrictions
imposed in this Section are in addition to those of the underlying Standard Zoning District or any other
provisions of this Chapter. This Section is established under the authority of Sections 62.23(7)(a) and (c),
Wisconsin Statutes and NR 811 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code.
(b) WHP Wellhead Protection District Boundaries. The regulations of this Section shall apply to land
surrounding Wells #2, #3, and #4, within wellhead protection district boundaries as mapped on the
Official Overlay Zoning Map.

Section 10-1-0600: Purpose
The purpose of this article is to establish regulations that address the exterior design and appearance of
structures and the relationship of structures to other structures, paved areas, landscaping areas, and other
required site design elements on the same building site or adjoining building sites.
Section 10-1-0601: Single Family and Two Family Housing Variety Standards
(a) General. Within the Village, no two Single-Family Detached dwellings or Two-Family (Duplex)
dwellings of similar front elevation or facade shall be repeated on any abutting lots or within 5 lots on
either side of the street on which the dwellings front, including lots which are directly across the street
from one another. Front elevations or facades shall be deemed to be similar when there is no substantial
difference in roof lines; and no substantial change in windows of either size, location or type; and either
no change in the color of materials used or no substantial change in the kind of materials, except where
such buildings are part of a unified development and similar building designs are approved by the Village.
(b) Roof Lines. The following differences in the roof lines of Single-Family Detached dwellings or Two-
Family dwellings as seen from the front of the dwelling shall be deemed sufficient to render buildings
containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be considered dissimilar:
(1) Changing gable roofs to hip roofs.
(2) Providing an intersecting gable roof on the main gable roof, if the height of the intersecting roof is at
least 50 percent of the height of the main roof.
(3) Providing an intersecting hip roof on the main hip roof, if the height of the intersecting hip roof is at
least 50 percent of the height of the main roof.
(4) Providing a shed roof when used as a front porch roof for a minimum of 50 percent of the entire
width of the house, excluding area of the garage.
(5) If the front soffit is increased significantly and is combined with columns at least 6 inches in width or
other architectural features of a similar magnitude which reach the roof line of the highest story.
(6) Rotating gable roofs 90 degrees on the building.
(7) On a tri-level residence or other building type that has 3 independent major roof areas, the changing
of 2 out of 3 roof lines.
(c) Windows. The following differences in the size, location or type of windows shall be deemed sufficient
to render buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar:
(1) Changing from single windows to a multiple window arrangement.
(2) Changing from multiple window arrangement to single windows.
(3) Changing the type of windows (e.g., a casement to double hung).
(4) Providing a bay or bow window variation in the area of the predominant window.
(5) Where, because of its size, location or design, one window is the predominant window on the front
elevation or facade, if the size, location or type of that window is changed to render the dwelling
dissimilar, then no other window need be changed.
(d) Construction Material or Color. The following differences in construction material between adjacent
Single-Family dwellings or Two-Family dwellings as seen from the front of the dwellings shall be deemed
sufficient to render buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar.

existing buildings in the area, or a different character if identified in the Village’s Comprehensive Plan.
No building shall be permitted where any exposed façade is constructed or faced with a finished material
that is aesthetically incompatible with other building facades in the area or which presents an unfinished
appearance to the public and surrounding properties. Building elevations clad with a singular exterior
surface material shall provide some additional architectural design element(s) to break up the plane of the
wall. This may be done by the addition of window(s), gable-end wall treatments, siding design and accent
panels, or other architectural design treatments consistent with the principal building design. The
following exterior construction materials shall generally not be considered of suitably high quality for
street side facades and other high visibility areas: non-decorative concrete block or cinder block, nondecorative
concrete foundation walls or panels, non-decorative plywood, asphaltic siding, or other
materials using exposed fastener systems or non-decorative surfaces as determined by the Plan

ARTICLE 7: LANDSCAPING AND PRESERVATION STANDARDS 7-1
ARTICLE 7: LANDSCAPING AND PRESERVATION STANDARDS
Section 10-1-0700: Purpose
The purpose of this Article is to establish landscaping requirements and other regulations intended to
preserve and maintain vegetation within in a manner that promotes the natural resource protection, aesthetic,
and public health goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
Section 10-1-0701: Landscaping Requirements
(a) Applicability. Any use for which site plan approval is required under Section 10-1-1307 shall provide
landscaping in accordance with the regulations of this Section, including expansions and/or renovation
of existing buildings. Except for screening requirements specifically required by Article 3, agricultural
uses and structures are exempt from these requirements. The Plan Commission may grant, via the site
plan approval process, modifications to the regulations in this Section for other uses in one or more of
the following circumstances:
(1) Where insufficient site area remains to fully comply with all provisions of this Section, in cases of a
redevelopment project or an expansion of an existing building, parking lot, or other site
improvements.
(2) Where other aspects of building or site design clearly exceed the associated requirements of this
Chapter, including where public art, gathering places, or other aesthetic amenities are incorporated.
(3) Where, due to unique circumstances associated with the site or project, the strict application of the
regulation would result in landscaping that would be overcrowded, impair the prospects of landscape
survival, and/or negatively affect the safety or functionality of the site or project.
(b) Required Landscape Plan. All proposed landscape plantings to be located on the subject property shall
be depicted on a landscape plan as to their location, type, and size at time of planting and maturity.
(c) Landscape Planting Requirements. Landscaping, “living plants,” shall be provided based on the
following requirements for street frontages, paved areas, building foundations, buffer yards, and general
yard areas. These requirements are additive to each other and any other landscaping or screening
requirements in this Chapter. By approval of the Plan Commission or Joint Committee, required
landscaping points may be shifted between areas (e.g., paved areas to building foundations), or may be
reduced if compensating landscape treatments for which points are not credited are provided. Credit for
existing landscape plantings that are retained and protected with the development of the site, and for
restoration or reestablishment of native flora, shall be allowed. The point system is described in greater
detail in subsection (d), below.
(1) Street Frontages. One large deciduous tree shall be planted for each 50 feet of property line along a
public street right-of-way and private streets. Said trees shall be planted in the public terrace
equidistant from the curb and the normal sidewalk line or on the private site within 10 feet of the
property line adjoining the public right-of-way. Tree or shrub planting in any public right-of-way or
on any public land in the Village shall be governed by Title 4, Chapter 4 of the Code.

(2) Paved Areas. Within the B-R, M-L, M-G, and AIR zoning districts, 100 points of landscaping shall
be planted for each 2,500 square feet of hard and gravel surfaced area, except for any airport runway
or taxiway area. Within all other zoning districts, 100 points of landscaping shall be planted for each
1,500 square feet of hard and gravel surfaced area. Hard and gravel surfaced areas do not include
rooftops, but do include other such areas within the ground plane including but not limited to
parking stalls, driveways, trash enclosure pads, loading docks, sidewalks, plazas and patios. Plants
required in this subsection shall be installed within landscaped islands within the hard surfaced area
or within 15 feet of its edges, and shall include large deciduous trees unless otherwise approved by
the Plan Commission or Joint Committee.

(3) Building Foundations. Within the B-R, M-L, M-G, and AIR zoning districts, 100 points of
landscaping shall be planted for each 50 lineal feet of exterior building wall that is visible from a
public right-of-way or residentially zoned property. Within all other zoning districts, 100 points of
landscaping shall be planted for each 75 lineal feet of exterior building wall for buildings of 20,000
square feet or less and for each 100 lineal feet for larger buildings. Plants required by this Section
must be installed within 20 feet of the building foundation, and shall not include large deciduous
shade trees.

(4) Bufferyards.
A bufferyard and bufferyard vegetative screen shall be provided (a) along the boundary of any
commercial, storage and disposal, transportation, manufacturing, and non-residential use when
established or substantially expanded adjacent to any residentially zoned property; (b) around general
storage areas per Section 10-1-0807(h); and (c) in other locations as may be required under this
Chapter. Bufferyards and bufferyard landscaping shall comply with the following.
a. The plantings shall be designed to provide an all-season screen with opacity (measured as a
percentage of the vertical plane along the bufferyard boundary from the ground to a height of 6
feet as viewed from the adjacent property) in accordance with individual land use regulations in
Article 3 of this Chapter.
b. The standard minimum width of a buffer yard shall be 25 feet. No vehicle accommodation area
other than a bike/pedestrian way, nor any outdoor storage area or structure shall be permitted in
a required bufferyard. The minimum structural and pavement setbacks established elsewhere in
this Chapter be increased to the extent necessary to meet the bufferyard screening requirements
of subsection (a) above.

Section 10-1-0701: Landscaping Requirements through Section 10-1-0701: Landscaping Requirements
ARTICLE 7: LANDSCAPING AND PRESERVATION STANDARDS 7-5
c. The Plan Commission or Joint Committee may require additional bufferyard width to the extent
necessary to meet the opacity requirements in subsection (a) above, if site topography, proposed
screening type, or other site requirements such as utility easements and stormwater management
facilities warrant. The Plan Commission or Joint Committee may also authorize a reduction to
the minimum width of the bufferyard to less than 25 feet if it determines that a lesser width is
both adequate to fulfill the intent of this Section and necessary owing to exceptional site
constraints beyond the control of the owner. The provision of necessary utility easements or
stormwater management structures necessary to serve the site shall not be sufficient cause to
reduce the bufferyard screening requirement.
d. Bufferyard landscaping shall have a minimum height of three feet at time of planting.
e. The use of landscaped berms in lieu of or in addition to the required vegetative screen may be
approved by the Plan Commission or Joint Committee, provided the slope of the slope of berm
is less than one vertical foot for every four feet of berm width measured at the at the base and
does not interfere with utilities or stormwater management.
f. The use of a decorative opaque fence or wall not exceeding six feet tall constructed of materials
compatible with the building on the site and adjacent uses may be approved by the Plan
Commission or Joint Committee in addition to or in lieu of bufferyard plantings. Unless the
opaque fence or wall is four feet or less in height and/or of exceptional quality (i.e. stone, brick),
at least 50 percent of tree and shrub plantings normally required to meet the bufferyard screening
requirement in subsection (a) should be planted between a property line the screening fence or
wall.

(5) General Yard Areas. Within the B-R, M-L, M-G, an AIR zoning districts, 100 points of landscaping
shall be planted for each 4,000 square feet of total lot area, excluding those areas under a rooftop,
hard or gravel surfaced area, required bufferyard, or being reserved for a future phase of
development. Within all other zoning districts, 100 points of landscaping shall be planted for each
3,000 square feet of total lot area, excluding those areas under a rooftop, hard or gravel surfaced area,
required bufferyard, or being reserved for a future phase of development. Landscaping required by
this standard shall be placed where appropriate on the site, but generally in those areas not covered
by other provisions of this Section.

(6) Other Green Space Areas. Green space areas not used for landscape plantings other than natural
resource protection areas shall be graded and seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable seed
mix, restored to native vegetation, or maintained in crop production if approved by the Plan
Commission or Joint Committee. Mulch of plantings or planting beds is acceptable provided that
such mulching consists of organic or natural materials. Mulches shall be installed so that they will not
erode, fall, be plowed or otherwise transported into walks, drives, streets or other hard surfaced
portions of the site.
(7) Natural Resource Protection Areas. Landscaping in required natural resource protection areas,
including those related to floodplains, wetlands, shorelands, woodlands, and wellhead protection
areas, shall be prohibited, except for restorative planting and maintenance necessary to maintain
native plantings in their natural state.
(d) Landscaping Points and Minimum Installation Sizes. All landscaping requirements are expressed in
landscape points. Each plant type is worth a certain number of landscape points that can be used to fulfill
the landscape requirements of this Section. Point values are determined by size at maturity, growth rate,
and other plant characteristics. Minimum permitted installation sizes for each plant category are provided
to ensure that landscaping provides its aesthetic and screening functions at the time of installation and to
improve the survival rate of the plants. The schedule of landscaping points and minimum permitted
installation sizes shall be in accordance with the following:

(n) Depiction on Required Site Plan. The configuration and location of any and all proposed access drives
on a property shall be depicted on any required Site Plan (per to Section 10-1-1307).
Section 10-1-0809: Off-Street Parking and Traffic Circulation Standards
(a) Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of this Section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public
rights-of-way so as to promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum
requirements for the provision of off-street parking and circulation in accordance with the utilization of
various sites. The requirements of this section shall not apply to agricultural uses, but shall apply to all other
uses and zoning districts as indicated where vehicles for employees, patrons, residents, guests, sale or rent
are kept.
(b) Depiction on Required Site Plan. Any and all parking and traffic circulation areas proposed to be
located on a property shall be depicted as to their location and configuration on the Site Plan, if required
for the development of the property (Section 10-1-1307). Each and every on-site parking space designed to
serve as required parking shall not be located farther than 300 feet of shortest walking distance from the
various areas or uses it is designated to serve, unless an exception is granted as part of a Conditional Use
Permit approval. A garage stall shall be considered a parking space.
(c) Use of Off-Street Parking Spaces. The use of all required off-street parking spaces shall be limited to the
parking of licensed vehicles, which shall also all be operable in residential zoning districts. The use of
parking spaces for other purposes shall only be permitted if sufficient off-street parking spaces remain
available for vehicular parking per the minimum requirements of this section as applied to the associated
land use.
(d) Traffic Circulation and Traffic Control. Site circulation shall be designed to provide for the safe and
efficient movement of all traffic entering, exiting, and on the site. Circulation shall be provided to meet the
individual needs of the site with specific mixing of access and through movements, and shall be depicted
on any required Site Plan. Circulation patterns shall conform with the general rules of the road and all
traffic control measures shall meet the requirements of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
(e) Installation and Maintenance of Off-Street Parking and Traffic Circulation Areas. All off-street
parking and traffic circulation areas shall be completed prior to building occupancy and shall be maintained
in a dust-free condition at all times. In no instance or manner shall any off-street parking or traffic
circulation area be used as a storage area.
(f) Off-Street Parking and Traffic Circulation Design Standards.
(1) Surfacing and Marking. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas (except for residential and
agricultural uses in the ETZ) shall be paved with a hard, all-weather surface. Each hard parking
surface intended for 6 or more parking stalls shall be striped in a manner which clearly indicates
required parking spaces.
(2) Curbing or Tire Bumper. All off-street parking areas designed to have head-in parking within 6½ feet
of any lot line shall provide a tire bumper or curb of adequate height and which is properly located to
ensure that no part of any vehicle will project beyond the pavement edge. Curbing or other adequate
barriers may also be required where necessary to properly direct stormwater flows, protect pedestrian
movement, protect pavement edges, or protect landscaped areas, as part of the Site Plan review
process.

(3) Lighting. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas serving 6 or more cars shall be lit so as to
ensure the safe and efficient use of said areas during the hours of use, with said illumination level
shall not exceeding the standards of Section 10-1-0811.
(4) Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway that is
wide enough and designed to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking
space without directly backing or maneuvering a vehicle into a public right-of-way. All off-street
parking and traffic circulation facilities shall be designed with an appropriate means of vehicular
access to a street or alley, in a manner which least interferes with traffic movements. Off-street
parking spaces for residential uses may be stacked or in front of one-another for the same building
unit. Parking spaces located behind an enclosed garage and located directly off a through aisle shall
be a minimum of 30 feet deep.
(5) Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required off-street parking or traffic circulation shall
comply with the requirements of Article 9.
(6) Handicapped Parking Spaces. Parking for the handicapped shall be provided at a size, number,
location, and with signage as specified by State and Federal regulations.
(7) Parking Space Design Standards. Other than parking required to serve the handicapped, the
minimum required length of parking spaces shall be 18 feet, and the minimum required width is 9
feet (7 ½ feet for end spaces). All parking spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of at least 7
feet.
(8) Snow Storage. Required off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall not be used for snow
storage.
(9) Parking Lot Design Standards.
a. Horizontal widths for driveways serving parking lots shall be not less than 24 feet for two-way
driveways and 12 feet for one way driveways. Additional design standards apply to Group
Developments (See Section 10-1-0604) and Large Retail and Commercial Service Developments
(See Section 10-1-0605).
b. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the requirements of the paved area landscaping
requirements in Section 10-1-0701.
(g) Calculation of Minimum Required Parking Spaces. The Minimum Parking Requirements stated for
each land use in Section 10-1-0310 shall be used to determine the minimum required number of off-site
parking spaces which must be provided on a property. Requirements are generally tied to the capacity of the
use; the Gross Floor Area of the use; or the number of employees which work at a property during the
largest work shift. The term "capacity" as used herein means the maximum number of persons that may be
accommodated by the use as determined by its design or by State Building Code regulations, whichever
number is greater. References herein to "employee(s) on the largest work shift" means the maximum
number of employees working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time period during
which this occurs, and regardless of whether any such person is a full-time employee. The largest work shift
may occur on any particular day of the week or during a lunch or dinner period in the case of a restaurant.
In all cases, one reserved parking space shall be provided for each vehicle used by the operation during
business hours. Said spaces shall be in addition to those required by Section 10-1-0310. Where said parking
needs of any land use exceed the minimum requirements of this Chapter, additional parking spaces
sufficient to meet the average maximum weekly peak-hour parking space demand shall be provided by said
land use.
(h) Limit on the Maximum Number of Required Parking Spaces. No Site Plan may be approved, for a
Multi-Family residential or non-residential use, which contains more than 120 percent of the development’s
minimum number of required parking spaces, except as granted through a Conditional Use Permit.

ARTICLE 8: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 8-18
(1) Where determinations can be made by the Zoning Administrator using equipment normally available
to the Village or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made
before notice of violations is issued.
(2) Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the Village to
maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations,
procedures shall be available for causing corrections or apparent violations of performance
standards, for protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable administration and
enforcement of performance standard regulations, and for protecting the general public from
unnecessary costs for administration and enforcement.
a. The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice, by certified mail or other means, ensuring a
signed receipt for such notice to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violations. The
notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the Zoning
Administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the
alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
b. The notice shall state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or to correct the alleged
violation to the satisfaction of the administrative official within the time limit set constitutes
admission of violation of the terms of this Chapter. The notice shall further state that upon
request of those to whom it is directed, technical determination as described in this Chapter will
be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall be charged

appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the determination will
be paid by the Village.

ARTICLE 9: SIGN REGULATIONS 9-2
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall review the submitted application for compliance with the
requirements of Section 10-1-0901(b). The application shall not be considered complete until all of
the requirements of Section 10-1-0901(b) are satisfied.
(2) Upon the receipt of a complete application, in cases where the requested sign does not require an
approval or recommendation from another body under another requirement of this Chapter, the
Zoning Administrator shall review said application for compliance with the requirements of the
remainder of this Section, and shall, in writing, approve or deny a sign permit based on the submitted
application within 10 working days of the acceptance of the complete application and payment of the
required fee.
(3) Upon the receipt of a complete application, and in cases where the requested sign requires an
approval or recommendation from another body under another requirement of this Chapter, such as
a Conditional Use Permit approval, the Zoning Administrator shall review said application for
compliance with the requirements of the remainder of this Section, and shall within 10 working days
of the acceptance of the complete application and payment of the required fee notify the applicant of
such additional recommendation or approval and schedule the item on appropriate meeting
agenda(s). Following all necessary approvals, the Zoning Administrator shall then, in writing, approve
or deny a sign permit based on the submitted application and such additional body’s
recommendation or action within 10 working days of action by the final body with approval or
recommending authority.
(4) Denial of a sign permit shall not result in total or partial reimbursement of permit fees paid.
(d) Basis for Granting. In deciding whether or not to grant a sign permit, the Zoning Administrator shall
determine whether the proposed sign is in compliance with the provisions of this Section; whether the
sign is in compliance with all provisions of the Prairie du Sac Code of Ordinances, including those related
to traffic safety, traffic visibility, sign setbacks, and structural integrity; whether a Conditional Use Permit
or other Village approval has or has not be granted for the sign, if such approval is required under this
Chapter; and, to the extent not in conflict with any of the above factors, the recommendation of any
other local governmental body or interested party.
(e) Enforcement and Revocation.
(1) Upon Class I notice and after a public hearing conducted by the Village Board, any permit may be
revoked by the Village Board in the event that the applicant has failed to comply with the provisions
of this Section or any conditions that may have accompanied the permit at the time of granting.
(2) Any sign permit granted by the Zoning Administrator shall be null and void and automatically
revoked in the event that construction, installation, or manufacture of the sign has not been
commenced within 180 days from the date of the issuance of such permit. If work authorized by
such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 90 days any time after the work is
commenced, the original permit shall become null and void. A new permit shall first be obtained to
complete the work, and a new permit fee shall be required.
(3) The sign(s) subject to any revoked permits shall be removed by the licensee, sign owner, or property
owner within 45 days of such revocation.
(4) Revocation shall not result in total or partial reimbursement of permit fees paid.
(f) Appeals. Any person affected by a decision of the Zoning Administrator may petition for a hearing
before the Zoning Board of Appeals under the provisions of Article 13. The filing of such petition
automatically stays removal of any sign involved and already legally erected until the Zoning Board of
Appeals decides whether to sustain, modify or withdraw the notice.

and specific requirements, including allowances for other signs in these districts under certain circumstances. In the event of any conflict, Section 10-
1-0906 controls.
Section 10-1-0907: Temporary Signs
(a) Normal Requirements for Temporary Signs. Temporary signs may be erected without a sign permit,
subject to the following provisions:
(1) Any one business, residence, or other principal use on a lot is permitted to display no more than one
temporary on-premise sign at a single time, except that number shall be increased to the indicated
number in the following circumstances:
a. Two, for construction sites where a building permit has been issued where required under the
Building Code, to be removed within 14 days following construction.
b. Two, when there is a garage sale, community event, and other permitted temporary event
unrelated to an on-going business operation, with such signs installed and removed within one
day of the sale or event.
c. There is no limit on the number of temporary window signs, and temporary window signs shall
not count against the maximums in this subsection (1). Window coverage of all temporary and
permanently mounted window signs shall not exceed the percentage in Section 10-1-0903(d)(1).
d. As otherwise allowed by state or federal law.
(2) All temporary signs shall be anchored and supported in a manner which reasonably prevents the
possibility of the signs becoming hazards to the public health and safety.
(3) A mobile, portable, or advertising vehicle sign is not a permitted temporary or permanent sign.
(4) Except where specifically approved by the Zoning Administrator, no temporary sign may be placed
in or over any public right-of-way. Where the Zoning Administrator approves a sign location in the
public right-of-way, he or she may require the sponsoring person, firm, organization, or corporation
to provide a certificate of liability insurance in an amount specified by the Zoning Administrator
based on the degree of public liability the sign installation creates. All liability policies shall name the
Village as an “additional insured.”

Section 10-1-0908: Structural Requirements through Section 10-1-0908: Structural Requirements
ARTICLE 9: SIGN REGULATIONS 9-18
(5) Each temporary sign shall be removed within 14 days of the activity, event, sale, or lease that it
promotes, except where otherwise indicated in this Section or under state or federal law.
(6) Except where exempted by state or federal law, temporary signs shall not exceed 12 square feet area
and six feet in height in residential districts in non-construction situations, 48 square feet in area and
eight feet in height in nonresidential districts in non-construction situations, and 96 square feet on
construction sites except that construction signs associated with construction of each individual
single family residence may not exceed 24 square feet.
(b) Alternative Approach to Temporary Signs. In the event that the requirements of subsection (a)
present restrictions on temporary signage that a property owner or business operator finds particularly
difficult to implement, such owner/operator may request that the Village waive or alter one or more
temporary sign requirements of that subsection. The process to make such a request for alteration or
waiver shall be through the Site Plan approval process specified under Section 10-1-1307. The materials
submitted with the application for Site Plan approval shall indicate and illustrate the particular
requirement(s) that the applicant desires to see waived and modified, the details of the proposed
temporary signage and all other signage on the property, and the proposed signage location(s) on a
professionally-prepared, scaled set of building elevations and/or site plan. Conditions of Site Plan
approval may limit the type, size, location, number, appearance, materials, lighting, and other aspects of
signage in a manner that differs from the applicant’s request, and may limit the number, type, size, or
locations of other types and locations of signs that are normally allowed under this Article.
Section 10-1-0908: Structural Requirements
(a) All signs shall be constructed and mounted so as to comply with State Building Codes.

placing of ladders against such building in the event of fire.
(d) All signs shall in no instance create a traffic visibility or other safety hazard.
(e) All signs shall be designed and constructed to withstand winds during typical Wisconsin storm events.
(f) Except for governmental signs and signs for single-family residential uses, all freestanding signs over 10
feet in height shall have footings for support of such sign which extend not less than 42 inches below the
existing ground level.
(g) No projecting sign shall be designed and constructed in which the attachment to such wall extends above
a point of bearing with the roof rafters.
(h) No illuminated sign shall be erected at any location which is not designed and constructed to meet the
following requirements:
(1) All signs shall be constructed and maintained to conform with State Electrical Codes and shall bear
UL labels. All sign permit applications in which electrical wiring and connections are proposed shall
be submitted to the Electrical Inspector. The Electrical Inspector shall examine the plans and
specifications submitted for the proposed sign and may require additional information relating to the
proposed electrical installation from the applicant. If the Electrical Inspector determines that the
proposed installation complies with local ordinances relating to the electrical wiring and construction,
then the Electrical Inspector shall approve the application and submit the approved application to

Section 10-1-0909: Maintenance Requirements
(a) All signs and structures appurtenant thereto shall be maintained in a neat and proper state of appearance.
(b) Proper maintenance shall be the absence of loose materials (including peeling paint, paper or other
material), the lack of excessive rust, the lack of excessive vibration or shaking, and the presence of the
original structural integrity of the sign, its frame and other supports, its mounting, and all components
thereof.
(c) The repainting, changing of parts, and preventive maintenance of signs which completely conform to the
requirements of this Section, and result in absolutely no change in the appearance of the sign from that

shall be deemed a nonconforming use or structure; and the provisions of Section 10-1-1203 shall
apply. Nonconforming signs may be maintained. No nonconforming on-premise sign shall be altered
or moved to a new location without being brought into compliance with the requirements of this
Article. Refer also to Section 10-1-0910 (b), below.
(2) Business signs on the premises of a nonconforming use or building may be continued, but new signs
for such uses shall not be allowed, nor shall expand in number, area, height, or illumination. New

message of a marquee or community information sign; or changing the face of an off-premise
advertising sign.
c. A tenant sign which comprises part of a Group Development sign may be replaced to
accommodate a new tenant sign without triggering the need to bring the entire Group
Development sign, or any of its parts, into compliance with the provisions of this Article.
(2) All non-conforming signs found not to be in compliance with the provisions of this Article shall be
removed within 30 days of receiving written notice of noncompliance and removal from the Zoning

Requirements
ARTICLE 10: PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 10-1
ARTICLE 10: PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
Section 10-1-1000: Purpose
The PUD Planned Unit Development district is established to encourage, promote and provide improved
environmental design by allowing for greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in the development of land,
while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of this Chapter and the Comprehensive Plan. To
this end, the PUD District allows diversification and variation in the relationship of uses, structures, open
spaces and heights of structures in developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive
unified projects. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic development with regard to
public services and to encourage and facilitate preservation of open land. The PUD District is not intended to
circumvent the intent of other zoning districts or this Chapter.
Section 10-1-1001: Allowable Uses in a PUD District
Any principal or accessory use permitted by right or allowed as a conditional use in any of the other Standard
and Overlay Zoning Districts of this Chapter may be permitted in the PUD District, subject to the criteria as
established in Section 10-1-1004 below; and provided such uses are expressly identified in the approved and
recorded Specific Implementation Plan associated with the particular development, and the General
Development Plan. Any uses not identified in the Specific Implementation Plan, the General Development
Plan, or both as being allowed uses shall be construed as being prohibited in the PUD District.
Section 10-1-1002: PUD Density, Intensity, Bulk and Design Requirements
(a) Flexibility. In the PUD District there shall be no predetermined specific lot area, lot width, height, floor
area ratio, yard and other dimensional and usable open space requirements, off-street parking
requirements, landscaping requirements, lighting requirements, signage requirements, and building and
site design requirements; but such requirements shall be made a part of an approved and recorded
Specific Implementation Plan and shall be, along with the General Development Plan, construed to be
and enforced as part of this Chapter. In the event that such requirements are not, in the determination of
the Zoning Administrator, adequately specified in an approved Specific Implementation Plan, the
requirements of this Chapter in the affected categorical areas shall prevail.
(b) Design Standards. Development within the PUD District shall achieve excellence in the design of the
built environment; shall generally exceed site, building, landscape, lighting, signage, and other aesthetic
standards of this Chapter; and shall conform with the design standards applicable to the type of
development or geographic area as included in the Comprehensive Plan or other adopted Village design
guidelines.
(c) Off-Street Parking. In the PUD District, the Village shall be guided by the principles set forth in Section
10-1-0809 of the Code and the minimum parking space requirements for individual land uses in Article 3
of this Chapter, but shall have the flexibility to establish specific parking requirements for the PUD
District that deviate therefrom; provided the best interests of the Village are promoted thereby. Such
requirements so established shall be made a part of the approved recorded Specific Implementation Plan
and shall be, along with the General Development Plan, construed to be and enforced as a part of this
Chapter. In the event that such requirements are not, in the determination of the Village Administrator,
adequately specified in an approved Specific Implementation Plan, the requirements of this Chapter in
the affected categorical areas shall prevail.
(d) Landscaping Standards. In no case shall a PUD be exempt from the Overlay Zoning District
requirements of this Chapter pertaining to floodplains, shorelands-wetlands, and wellhead protection. For
landscaping standards, the Village shall be guided by the principles set forth in Article 7, but shall have
the flexibility to establish specific landscape and open space requirements that deviate therefrom;

provided the best interests of the Village are promoted thereby. Such requirements so established shall be
made part of the approved recorded Specific Implementation Plan and shall be, along with the General
Development Plan, construed to be and enforced as a part of this Chapter. In the event that such
requirements are not, in the determination of the Village Administrator, adequately specified in an
approved Specific Implementation Plan, the requirements of this Chapter in the affected categorical areas
shall prevail.
(e) Performance Standards and Signage. In the PUD District, the Village shall be guided by the principles
set forth in Article 8: Performance Standards, and Article 9: Sign Regulations, but shall have the flexibility
to establish specific requirements for the PUD District that deviate there from; provided the best
interests of the Village are promoted thereby and that said deviations do not violate federal or state
requirements. Specific PUD requirements so established shall be made a part of the approved and
recorded Specific Implementation Plan and shall be, along with the General Development Plan,
construed to be and enforced as a part of this Chapter. In the event that such requirements are not, in the
determination of the Village Administrator, adequately specified in an approved Specific Implementation
Plan, the requirements of this Code in the affected categorical areas shall prevail.
(f) Land Division. Any land division in a proposed PUD District shall comply with Title 10, Chapter 3 of
this Municipal Code.
Section 10-1-1003: Procedural Requirements for the Planned Unit Development District
(a) Pre-application Conference. Prior to the official submission of a petition for the approval of a PUD
District, the owner or the owner’s agent shall meet with the Zoning Administrator to discuss the scope
and proposed nature of the contemplated development, who may, at his or her discretion, refer the
matter to the Plan Commission or Joint Committee for its input.
(b) Petition for Rezoning Approval. Following the pre-application conference, the owner or the owner’s
agent may file a petition with the Zoning Administrator for approval of a zoning change to the PUD
District. Such petition shall be accompanied by payment of a PUD review fee as established from time to
time by action of the Village Board. The procedure for rezoning to a PUD District shall be as required

approval and recording of a Specific Implementation Plan, and only for the land area covered by such
Specific Implementation Plan.
(e) Recording. Upon final approval of the application and adoption of a zoning change to the PUD District
by the Village Board, the General Development Plan, as approved, shall be recorded by the developer
within 90 days following such approval, in the Sauk County Register of Deeds’ office. Within 30 days of
its recording, the applicant shall provide the Village with a digital copy of the recorded General
Development Plan, along with proof of its recording. Detailed construction and engineering plans need
not be completed at the time the rezoning is approved, but the approval and recording of such General
Development Plan shall be conditioned upon the subsequent submittal, approval and recording of more
specific and detailed plans as part of the Specific Implementation Plan.
Section 10-1-1004: Basis for General Development Plan (GDP) Approval
In reviewing a PUD District/General Development Plan application, the following criteria shall be applied
with specific consideration as to whether or not it is consistent with the spirit and intent of this Chapter,
whether or not it is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans and guidelines affecting
the PUD area, whether or not it has been prepared with professional advice and guidance, and whether or not
it produces significant benefits in terms of environmental design.
(a) Character and Integrity of Land Use. In a PUD District, the uses proposed and their intensity and
arrangement on the site shall be of a visual and operational character which:
(1) Are compatible to the physical nature of the site and surrounding land uses.
(2) Would produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and ecological desirability, economic
stability, community sustainability, and functional practicality compatible with the comprehensive

Section 10-1-1100: Purpose
(a) The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) zoning district is intended to allow desirable and
innovative development activities and variation in the relationship of uses, structures and open spaces in
neighborhood developments conceived and implemented as cohesive, unified projects. This zoning
district is intended to promote the development of land consistent with the following traditional
neighborhood design principles:
(1) Creates an environment that promotes human interaction, a healthy civic life, a sense of place, and a
high-quality living environment;
(2) Compact and reflects the character of historic development patterns in the Village;
(3) Designed for the human scale and for walkability;
(4) Provides a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic, and open space uses in close
proximity to one another, along with a vertical mixing of uses in multi-story buildings;
(5) Provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and
incomes;
(6) Incorporates a system interconnected streets with sidewalks and paths that offer multiple routes for
motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists within and through the neighborhood;
(7) Retains, to the extent reasonably practical, existing buildings with historical or architectural features
that enhance the visual character of the community;
(8) Incorporates significant environmental features into the design; and
(9) Is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
Section 10-1-1101: Minimum TND District Size
Each mapped TND zoning district shall be a minimum of 20 acres in Gross Site Area, except that an
individual TND project may be smaller than 20 acres if it is anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan to be part
of a contiguous TND-zoned area of 20 acres or greater.
Section 10-1-1102: Allowable and Required Uses in a TND District
(a) Any land use that is permitted by right or as a conditional use, accessory use, or temporary use in any of
the other zoning districts in this Chapter, or mix of uses, may be permitted within a TND subject to the
criteria listed below. All SIPs shall specify the range of proposed and approved land uses in that particular
TND, which when approved shall be construed to be and enforced as part of this Chapter. The total
Gross Site Area in the TND devoted to commercial and institutional uses shall not exceed 25 percent of
the Gross Site Area of the entire TND. Each TND shall include a carefully planned and integrated mix
of land uses with varied development densities throughout the project, as provided below:
(1) Residential Use Areas. Each TND shall include at least one area intended for predominately
residential use. The overall mix of residential uses within each Large TND shall resemble the mix of
existing housing types and tenure within the entire Village. Each TND shall include at least two of
the following types of residential uses:
a. Single-Family detached dwellings, on a mix of lot sizes throughout the neighborhood.
b. Duplexes, townhouses, and row houses.
c. Multi-Family dwellings.

places and focal points for the project. The highest development density within the TND shall occur
in and adjacent to the mixed-use area(s). Figure 10-1-1102(a) shows one example of a mixed-use area.
At least 90 percent of the dwelling units within the TND shall be within ¼ mile from a mixed-use
area within or outside of the project. Each TND shall include at least one mixed-use area, unless the
Comprehensive Plan identifies the location of a mixed-use area on a nearby site and the “90 percent”
criterion in the previous sentence will be met. The mixed-use area shall include an appropriate mix of
the following uses:
a. Neighborhood commercial uses, such as services, retail, restaurants, and accommodations.
b. Attached residential dwellings, including duplexes, townhouses, rowhouses, Multi-Family,
second-story residential units, live/work units, and special needs housing.
c. Civic or institutional uses, such as places of worship; educational facilities; or usable, developed
common open space like a town square.
(3) At Least One Common Green Space Area. At least 15 percent of the Gross Site Area of the TND
must remain as permanently protected common green space. At least 90 percent of the dwelling units
within the TND shall be within ¼ mile from a protected common green space area. Permanently
protected common green space areas include public parks, environmental corridors, trails, protected
natural areas, and private parks that are permanently restricted from non-recreational development,
but do not include private yards, stormwater management basins, or stormwater conveyance
channels. Small neighborhood parks, playgrounds, and squares should be integrated into the project,
while large outdoor recreation areas should generally be located at the periphery.

installed by the developer, unless otherwise approved by the Village. Clear and well-lighted walkways
shall connect building entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk and to any associated parking areas.
Curb bulb-outs, median refuges, and other related techniques should be incorporated along collector
streets and at key intersections to shorten the pedestrian crossing distance. Between-lot walkways or
paths may be required where necessary to maintain the continuity of the pedestrian circulation
system.
(3) Bicycle Circulation. Facilities for bicycle travel shall be included in the project and installed at the
developer’s expense, unless otherwise approved by the Village. Such facilities may include off-street
bicycle and multi-use paths, striped bicycle lanes on streets per Figure 10-1-1104(a), signed bicycle
routes, or some combination. Any existing bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved,
enhanced, or relocated if necessary. Selected bicycle routes and facilities shall implement the
recommendations in the Comprehensive Plan. All businesses, civic uses, and Multi-Family dwelling
units shall provide adequate bicycle parking areas and facilities.
(4) Motor Vehicle Circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be designed to efficiently move motor
vehicle traffic via multiple routes and to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic
calming features such as curb extensions, traffic circles, medians, and on-street parking are
encouraged slow traffic speeds. Arterial streets should generally not bisect a TND. Minor streets
within the TND are intended to be used primarily for access to abutting properties, and are usually
not subject to access controls. Collector streets within the TND are intended to carry traffic from
minor streets to arterial streets, include the principal entrance street to a residential use area, and may
be subject to access controls. Alleys are special public ways affording secondary access to the rear of
abutting properties, and may be public or private based on the approved TND. Minimum street
design standards for a TND shall be in accordance with Figure 10-1-1104(a), (b), and (c).
(5) Street Layout. The TND shall maintain the existing street grid, where present, and restore any
disrupted street grid where feasible. The orientation of streets shall be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, enhance the visual impact of common open spaces and prominent buildings,
create lots that facilitate passive solar design, minimize street gradients, and minimize the use of
double frontage lots. All streets shall extend through the project or terminate at other streets, except
streets may temporarily “dead end” when such streets will connect to future phases or other sites
outside the TND and minor streets may permanently terminate in a cul-de-sac only where site
conditions require a cul-de-sac and there will be a through connection via a pedestrian way or bicycle
path at the end.
(6) Parking and Loading Requirements. All TNDs shall meet the parking and loading requirements
found elsewhere in this Chapter, except that the Village may allow adjacent on-street parking within a
TND to apply toward the minimum parking requirements. For Multi-Family residential buildings and
in mixed-use areas, shared use parking lots and structures are encouraged, off-street parking lots may
not be adjacent to or opposite from a street intersection, and parking lots and structures shall be
located to the rear or sides of buildings. The edges of parking lots, landscaped islands, and all other
areas not used for parking or vehicular circulation shall be landscaped and curbed per the
requirements in Section 10-1-1104(d). Examples of these parking lot placement and landscaping
standards are included in Figure 10-1-1104(d). Reduction of impervious surfaces through the use of
pervious pavement, interlocking pavers, and similar techniques is encouraged, particularly for remote
parking lots and parking areas for periodic uses.

Section 10-1-1105: Architectural Requirements
A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to give each building or group of
buildings a distinct character, while maintaining a compatible design theme throughout the TND. More
specific design standards that shall be met are as follows:
(a) Existing Structures. Existing structures, if determined to be historic, architecturally, or culturally
significant, shall be protected from demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or land
development, to the extent reasonably practical. The U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation of Historic Properties shall be used as criteria for renovating significant structures.
(b) New Structures.
(1) General Design. New buildings shall be of consistently high and lasting quality throughout the
project. The bulk and height of each building shall property relate to and flow from surrounding
buildings, and shall be in proper proportion to the size of the lot on which it is to be placed. The
style, materials, and design of new buildings may be organized around a consistent design theme that
may draw from a local vernacular architectural style and/or natural building materials common to the
region. However, design monotony shall be avoided (see Figure 10-1-1105(a)). Unless otherwise
approved by the Village to carry out a particular design theme of exceptional quality, no two principal
buildings within four lots on either side of the street on which the buildings front shall have a similar
front facade. Front facades shall be deemed to be similar where there is:
a. No substantial difference in roof lines or form; and
b. No substantial change in window size, location, or type; and
c. No or minimal change in material colors.

dwellings and attached dwellings, and six stories for commercial, Multi-Family, or mixed use
buildings.
(3) Entries and Facades. Similar architectural features, materials, and the articulation of a building façade
shall be continued on all sides visible from a public street. The front façade of the principal building
shall face onto the street yard of a public street (not directly toward a parking lot) and shall parallel
the line of the street to create a continuous edge. As buildings are moved closer to the street and to
each other, special attention should be paid to design details and landscaping. Porches, entry bays,
covered walkways or stoops, hooded front doors, or other similar architectural elements shall define
the front entrances to all dwelling units; such features shall generally be closer to the street than the
remainder of the dwelling. Porches are recommended to be a minimum of six feet deep to enhance
aesthetics and function. For nonresidential buildings, a minimum of 50 percent of the public street
façade(s) on the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting of window or door openings, and
entries shall face the public street. Figure 10-1-1105(b) provides examples of required treatments of

(4) Garages. Garages accessed from the public street, where garage doors face a public street, shall
occupy no more than 50 percent of the front façade of the house. Residential garages shall be set
back a minimum of two feet to the rear of the main front façade of the dwelling structure (not
including porches or other projections) to ensure that the garage does not dominate the view from
the street. Where the house does not include a front porch or similar projection from the main living
area of the house, garages shall be set back a minimum of four feet to the rear of the main front
façade. Garage setbacks along alleys shall either be between two and eight feet from the alley rightof-
way to allow proper turning radii but no driveway parking, or at least 16 feet to allow driveway
parking without encroaching into the alley. Garage placement alternatives and standards are
illustrated in Figure 10-1-1105(c).

Section 10-1-1106: Additional TND District Requirements
(a) Street Trees. An average minimum of one deciduous tree per 50 feet of public street frontage shall be
required to be planted by the developer, except if otherwise approved by the Village. Street tree
placements may be clustered or adjusted to achieve a particular design objective or account for traffic
visibility, curb openings, street lighting, and other obstructions. Street trees shall generally be located
between the sidewalk and the curb and within the landscaped area of a boulevard. If placement of street
trees within the right-of-way will interfere with pre-existing utility lines, trees may be planted within the
private street yard adjacent to the sidewalk.
(b) Landscaping Standards. In no case shall a TND be exempt from the Overlay District requirements of
this Chapter. For landscaping standards, the Village shall be guided by the principles set forth in Article 7,
but shall have the flexibility to establish specific landscape and open space requirements that deviate
therefrom; provided the best interests of the Village are promoted thereby. Such requirements so
established shall be made part of the approved recorded Specific Implementation Plan and shall be, along
with the General Development Plan, construed to be and enforced as a part of this Chapter. In the event
that such requirements are not, in the determination of the Village Administrator, adequately specified in
an approved Specific Implementation Plan, the requirements of this Chapter in the affected categorical
areas shall prevail.
(c) Performance Standards and Signage. In the TND District, the Village shall be guided by the
principles set forth in Article 8: Performance Standards, and Article 9: Sign Regulations, but shall have
the flexibility to establish specific requirements for the TND District that deviate there from; provided
the best interests of the Village are promoted thereby and that said deviations do not violate federal or
state requirements. Specific TND requirements so established shall be made a part of the approved and
recorded Specific Implementation Plan and shall be, along with the General Development Plan,
construed to be and enforced as a part of this Chapter. In the event that such requirements are not, in the
determination of the Village Administrator, adequately specified in an approved Specific Implementation
Plan, the requirements of this Code in the affected categorical areas shall prevail.
(d) Land Division. Any land division in a proposed TND District shall comply with Title 10, Chapter 3 of
this Municipal Code.
Section 10-1-1107: Procedural Requirements for the Traditional Neighborhood Development District
The procedural requirements for the TND District shall be identical to those of the PUD Planned Unit

ARTICLE 12: NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, STRUCTURES AND SITES 12-1
ARTICLE 12: NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, STRUCTURES AND SITES
Section 10-1-1200: Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to establish requirements for the following nonconforming situations:
substandard lots, nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming sites created legally
prior to August 18, 2011. Nonconforming signs are addressed further in Article 9.
Section 10-1-1201: Nonconforming and Substandard Lots
(a) Upon and after August 18, 2011, no lot shall be created which does not meet the lot dimensional
(density, intensity, and bulk) requirements of the associated zoning district, per Article 4.
(b) A lot of record existing on August 18, 2011, but not meeting the lot dimensional (density, intensity, and
bulk) requirements of the associated zoning district per Article 4, may be utilized as a building site for a
permitted use (but not for a conditional use) in the associated zoning district, if all of the following apply:
(1) Such lot has never been developed with one or more of its structures placed partly on an adjacent lot
or parcel.
(2) Such lot is developed to comply with this Chapter and other applicable chapters of the Municipal
Code.
Section 10-1-1202: Nonconforming Uses
(a) Continuance of a Nonconforming Use.
(1) Any nonconforming use lawfully existing on August 18, 2011 or any amendment to it may be
continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as specified in this
Section.
(2) A use first regulated as a conditional use following August 18, 2011 which was approved as a legal
land use—either permitted by right or as a conditional use—prior to August 18, 2011 shall be
considered as a legal, conforming land use so long as any previously approved conditions are
followed. Any modification of the previously approved plans or conditions of use shall require
application and Village consideration under the requirements of this Chapter.
(3) Any prior legal use made nonconforming by a modification to the Official Zoning Map after August
18, 2011 may be granted legal conforming use status by changing the zoning district of the affected
property to an appropriate district through a zoning map amendment, or by allowing that use within
the then-current zoning district through a zoning text amendment. Any such requested amendments
shall be subject to the standards and procedures prescribed by Section 10-1-1301 or 10-1-1302.
(b) Modification of a Nonconforming Use.
(1) A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, or reconstructed, unless the use is
first changed to a use permitted in the district in which the use is located, or otherwise qualifies under
subsection (d).
(2) Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by site plan approval of the Plan Commission or, if
in the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction, by the Joint Committee.
(c) Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use. When any nonconforming use of any structure or land is
discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use
of said structure or land shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.
(d) Maintenance and Repair of a Nonconforming Use. The ordinary maintenance and repair of a
nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations which do not

exacerbate the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this Chapter.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, whenever a nonconforming use is damaged to the extent of
more than 50 percent of the then-current equalized assessed value of the use and associated structure,
such use shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the total structural repairs or alterations in a conforming
structure containing a nonconforming use shall not during its life exceed 50 percent of the equalized
assessed value of said structure at the time of the first known structural repair or alteration, unless the use
within said structure is permanently changed to a conforming use.
Section 10-1-1203: Nonconforming Structures
(a) Any structure lawfully existing on August 18, 2011 may be continued at the size and in a manner of
operation existing upon such date, except as provided in this Section.
(b) Any lawful nonconforming structures existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this Chapter
may be continued, although its size or location does not conform with the lot dimensions and access
provisions of this Chapter. Any lawful nonconforming structures may be allowed to be extended,
enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, provided that said extension, enlargement,
reconstruction, movement or alteration complies with the setback and building requirements of the
specific zoning district, except for the existing nonconformance. However, the nonconforming feature of
a lawful nonconforming structure shall not be allowed to become more nonconforming by being
extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except as permitted under Section 10-1-
411 or when required to do so by law, or order, or to comply with the provisions of this Chapter, or with
the approval of the appropriate Zoning Board of Appeals.
(c) A damaged or destroyed nonconforming structure may be restored or replaced to the size, location, and
use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, without any limits on the costs of
the repair, reconstruction, or improvement if all of the following apply:
(1) The nonconforming structure was damaged or destroyed on or after August 18, 2011.
(2) The damage or destruction was caused by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or
infestation.
The size of any such restored or replaced structure may be larger than the size it was immediately before
the damage or destruction only if necessary for the structure to comply with applicable state or federal
requirements.
(d) Unsafe Structures. Nothing in this Chapter shall preclude the Zoning Administrator or any other
authorized local official from initiating remedial or enforcement actions when a lawful nonconforming
structure is declared unsafe or presents a danger the public health, safety, or welfare.
(e) Future Modification. When any lawful nonconforming structure in any district is modified so as to be
in conformance with the provisions of this Chapter, any future modification of said structure shall be in
conformance with the provisions of this Chapter.
(f) Ordinary Maintenance. Ordinary maintenance repairs, including repairs reasonably necessary to
prevent the deterioration of a structure, and remodeling of a nonconforming structure are permitted, as
well as necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not extend, enlarge, or intensify the
nonconforming structure. Ordinary maintenance repairs and remodeling include internal and external
painting, decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the installation of heating, electricity,
plumbing (including fixtures) or insulation, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other nonstructural
components.
(g) Alterations. Structural alterations may be made to a building containing lawful nonconforming
residential units, provided such alterations do not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of

the building. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a conforming garage may be added if none previously
existed. However, after August 18, 2011, such buildings shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended
without bringing the enlargement, expansion or extension into compliance with the provisions of the
Chapter unless a variance is granted under Section 10-1-1309, or in the Extraterritorial Zoning
Jurisdiction, Section 10-1-1310 and except as permitted under this Section.
(h) Timing of Building Permit. Any structure for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior
to August 18, 2011 or an amendment to it which will become nonconforming under the provisions of
this Chapter or that amendment thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans,
provided construction is started within 365 calendar days after issuance of the permit for Single- and
Two-Family residential construction and within 365 calendar days after issuance of a permit for all other
development, and construction is completed within 730 calendar days (2 years) after the start of
construction. If all such conditions are met, the structure shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming
structure.
Section 10-1-1204: Nonconforming Site
(a) Definition. A nonconforming site is one in which a principal use has been established prior to August
18, 2011 and on which one or more site development standards such as minimum landscape surfaces,
bufferyards, plantings, or minimum parking have not been met or cannot be met owing to the
configuration of the site or existing structures whether conforming or nonconforming.
(b) Blanket Variance. A blanket variance for any and all requirements of this Chapter is hereby
automatically granted to all development sites in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of
August 18, 2011. Rationale: The “blanket variance” provision of this Section is intended to prevent the creation of certain
nonconforming sites subject to the requirements of this Chapter. This Section is intended to ensure that sites approved prior to
the adoption of this Chapter do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered
nonconforming.
(c) After August 18, 2011, additional site development that results in enlargement, expansion or extension of
uses or structures will not be allowed to occur without bringing the site into full compliance with all
nonconforming site development standards or into compliance to the extent practical without removal of
lawful structures in accordance with the following Subsections (d) through (i) below.
(d) On lots where the site configuration and undeveloped area are sufficient to comply with nonconformities
in site design; no enlargement, expansion, or extension of a use or structure shall be permitted if it makes
compliance with site regulations of the Chapter impossible, even if said enlargement, expansion, or
extension of the use or structure would otherwise be permissible.
(e) Enlargements, expansions or extensions that would result in creation of one or more nonconformities,
render a nonconforming site incapable of being brought into full or greater compliance with
nonconforming site requirements, or increase the degree of existing nonconformities with the site
development standards of this Chapter shall not be permitted, unless a variance is granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals under Section 10-1-1309, or in the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction, Section 10-1-
1310.
(f) On lots with adequate configuration and area to bring the site into full or greater compliance with site
design standards, said compliance shall be required at the time of any property improvement,
modification, enlargement, or expansion requiring site plan review by the Plan Commission or Joint
Committee. The degree to which the property shall be made to comply with substandard site design
elements shall be proportional to degree of property improvement per the following:
(g) Total additions or expansions to structures on nonconforming sites shall require correction of existing
nonconformities of on-site improvements in accordance with the following:

Section 10-1-1204: Nonconforming Site through Section 10-1-1204: Nonconforming Site
ARTICLE 12: NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, STRUCTURES AND SITES 12-4
(1) Renovations that do not result in expansions or result in expansions of the total gross square footage
of the existing structure(s) and/or outdoor storage areas less than 50 percent of the existing
structural and/or outdoor storage area within any continuous five year period shall require a
corresponding percentage increase in compliance with the site improvements required by this
Chapter until the site achieves 100 percent compliance. (Example: A property with a permitted,
expandable use currently has only 50 percent of the required landscaping. An addition to the
structure equaling 20 percent of the combined area of the existing structures and outdoor
operations/storage uses on a site is proposed. Therefore, as a condition of approval, an additional 20
percent of landscaping required for the whole site must be added. In this instance, 70 percent of the
landscaping requirement would be met upon completion of the improvements).
(2) Complete replacement of existing structures or expansions of the existing structures that result in a
total of 50 percent or greater increase of total gross square footage within any continuous five year
period require the entire property to meet all of the site improvement requirements of this Title. The
same requirements also apply to increased or new outdoor areas used for outdoor
operations/storage.
(h) On lots where the configuration and undeveloped area of the nonconforming site provides insufficient
space to bring the site into full compliance with all site requirements but nevertheless provides space to
reduce the degree of one or more nonconformities, the Plan Commission or Joint Committee shall make
a determination as to the manner and degree to which each site nonconformities shall be brought into
conformance.

(3) Written justification for the proposed map amendment, consisting of the reasons why the applicant
believes the proposed map amendment is in harmony with recommendations of the Comprehensive
Plan and other review criteria of this Section.
(4) Any required fee as stated in the Schedule of Fees (Section 10-1-1318).
(d) Review Criteria for Amendments to the Official Zoning Map. Applicants, the Zoning Administrator,
Plan Commission (or the Joint Committee if within the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction), and Village Board
shall use the following criteria when reviewing an application to amend the Official Zoning Map:
(1) The proposed amendment to the Official Zoning Map is consistent with the recommendations of
the Comprehensive Plan.
(2) The proposed Official Zoning Map amendment is consistent with the purpose and intent of this
Chapter as expressed in Article 0?
(3) The Official Zoning Map amendment addresses at least one of the following that are not properly
addressed on the current Official Zoning Map:
a. A mistake was made in mapping on the Official Zoning Map. That is, an area is or has developed
in a manner and purpose different from that for which it is mapped. If this reason is cited, it
must be demonstrated that the discussed inconsistency between actual land use and designated
zoning is not intended, as the Village may intend to stop an undesirable land use pattern from
being perpetuated.
b. Factors have changed, such as the availability of new data, the presence of new roads or other
infrastructure, additional development, annexation, or other zoning changes, making the subject
property more appropriate for a different zoning district.
c. Growth patterns or rates have changed, thereby creating the need for an amendment to the
Official Zoning Map.
(4) The proposed amendment to the Official Zoning Map maintains the desired consistency of land
uses, land use intensities, and land use impacts as related to the environs of the subject property.
(5) No land in the A-P zoning district shall be rezoned to any other district, unless following a public
hearing the Village Board finds that all of the following criteria have been met:
a. The land is better suited for a use not allowed in the A-P district.
b. The rezoning is consistent with the Sauk County Farmland Preservation Plan and the
Comprehensive Plan.
c. The rezoning will not substantially impair or limit current or future agricultural use of
surrounding parcels of land that are zoned for or legally restricted to agricultural use.
d. If the rezoning is intended to enable a dwelling unit without first amending the Farmland
Preservation Plan and the Comprehensive Plan, the Village Board shall find that the following
additional criteria are met:
1. The dwelling unit must be on a separate lot meeting the minimum lot size of the approved
zoning district and a maximum lot size of not greater than 5 acres.
2. The farm from which such lot is divided shall be not fewer than 35 acres.
3. Total number of dwelling units on any farm as it was configured on August 18, 2011 shall
not exceed an overall density of one dwelling unit per 35 acres, with no rounding permitted.
For example, a 160 acre farm as of that date shall be allowed to accumulate no greater than
four total dwelling units (160 / 35 = 4.57 = 4).

written agreement of the applicant) shall constitute approval of the application. Prior to taking final
action, the Village Board may request additional information from outside experts, the applicant, or
any other source it deems necessary to allow evaluation of the amendment against the criteria of
Subsection (d).
(2) The Village Board may act to approve or reject an amendment to the Official Zoning Map by a
simple majority of a voting quorum, except that if the amendment is defined as a down zoning under
Section 66.10015(1)(as) of Wisconsin Statutes, then approval of that amendment shall require a 2/3
vote of the full Village Board, or by a simple majority of the full Village Board if the down zoning is

Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits through Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-7
(c) Fees. The Village may require a fee may for a zoning permit. A double fee may be charged by the Zoning
Administrator if work is started before a permit is applied for and issued. Such double fee shall not
release the applicant from full compliance with this Chapter nor from prosecution for violation of this
Chapter.
Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits
(a) Purpose. The development and execution of this Chapter is based upon the division of the Village into
zoning districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings
and structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there
are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as
unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of
the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the
particular use at a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed
in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location, development and operation of
such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses.
(b) Initiation of Conditional Use Permit. Any person, firm, corporation or organization having a freehold
interest or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may
become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable in
the land for which a conditional use is sought may file an application to use such land for one or more of
the conditional uses in the zoning district in which such land is located.
(c) Application for Conditional Use Permit. No application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be placed
on any agenda as an item to be acted upon unless the Zoning Administrator has certified acceptance of a
complete application. A proposed Conditional Use Permit may be placed on any agenda as a discussiononly
item, with the permission of the Zoning Administrator, without a complete application. Prior to
publication of the required Notice of Public Hearing, the applicant shall provide the Zoning
Administrator one easily reproducible electronic copy of the complete application, and paper copies if
required by the Administrator. Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(1) A completed Conditional Use Permit application form furnished by the Zoning Administrator,
including names and addresses of the applicant, owner of the site, architect, professional engineer,
and other professionals involved with the application.
(2) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the Conditional Use Permit is proposed,
and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names
and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current records of
the Register of Deeds. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow
shall be provided.
(3) A written description of the proposed conditional use describing the type, duration, and density of
activities, buildings, and structures proposed for the subject property and their general locations.
(4) A site plan of the subject property if proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to any
applicable requirements of Section 10-1-1307. If the conditional use will make use of existing site
improvements, a site plan need only be of sufficient detail to confirm the portion of the site used by
the conditional use.
(5) If the proposed conditional use is a Large Retail and Commercial Service Development as defined in
Section 10-1-0302(p), all additional information required under Section 10-1-0605.
(6) Written justification for the proposed conditional use consisting of the reasons why the applicant
believes the proposed conditional use is appropriate, particularly as evidenced by compliance with the
VILLAGE OF PRAIRIE DU SAC ZONING ORDINANCE OCTOBER 3, 2019
Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits through Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-8
approval criteria set forth in this Section. The applicant must demonstrate that the application and all
applicable requirements of this Chapter will be satisfied.
(7) Any other plans and information deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator, the Plan
Commission (or the Joint Committee if within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) to ensure that
the requirements of this Chapter are or will be fulfilled.
(8) Any required fee as stated in the Schedule of Fees (Section 10-1-1330).
(d) Review Criteria for Conditional Use Permit.
(1) If the applicant meets, or agrees to meet, all of the applicable requirements specified in this Chapter
and conditions imposed by the Plan Commission (or the Joint Committee if within the
Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction), the Commission (or Committee) shall under Section
62.23(7)(de)2.a. of Wisconsin Statutes grant the Conditional Use Permit. The Village may require
written agreement from the applicant in a form prescribed by the Village Attorney.
(2) Any decision to grant or deny the Permit must be supported by substantial evidence, as that term is
defined in Section 62.23(7)(de)1.b. of Wisconsin Statutes. Any condition or modification must be
related to the purpose of this Chapter, reasonable, measurable to the extent practicable, and based on
substantial evidence.
(3) To the extent consisted with Subsections (1) and (2), no Conditional Use Permit shall be granted
unless the Plan Commission (or Joint Committee if within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction)
finds that the use authorized thereby meets the following criteria:
a. The proposed conditional use (the use in general, independent of its location) is in harmony with
the vision, purpose, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the Comprehensive Plan, this
Chapter, and any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to
official notice by the Village.
b. The proposed conditional use, in its proposed location and as depicted on the required site plan,
will not result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on nearby property, the character of the
neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public
property or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety, or general welfare,
either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the
implementation of the provisions of this Chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, or any other plan,
program, map, or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the
Village or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide development.
c. The proposed conditional use will maintain the desired consistency of land uses, land use
intensities, and land use impacts as related to the environs of the subject property.
d. The proposed conditional use is located in an area that will be adequately served by, and will not
impose an undue burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities or services provided by
public agencies serving the subject property.
e. The potential public benefits of the proposed conditional use outweigh potential adverse impacts
of the proposed conditional use, after taking into consideration the applicant’s proposal and any
requirements recommended by the applicant to ameliorate such impacts.
(4) Also to the extent consistent with Subsections (1) and (2), no Conditional Use Permit shall be
granted in the A-P district unless the Plan Commission (or Joint Committee if within the
Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) finds that the use authorized thereby meets the following
additional criteria:

Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits through Section 10-1-1304: Conditional Use Permits
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-9
a. The use and its location in the farmland preservation zoning district are consistent with the
purposes of the A-P zoning district.
b. The use and its location in the A-P district are reasonable and appropriate, considering
alternative locations, or are specifically approved under state or federal law. For Non-Metallic
Mineral Extraction operations, alternative locations outside of the A-P district must be
considered.
c. The use is reasonably designed to minimize the conversion of land, at and around the site of the
use, from agricultural use or open space use.
d. The use does not substantially impair or limit the current or future agricultural use of
surrounding parcels of land that are zoned for or legally restricted to agricultural use.
e. Construction damage to land remaining in agricultural use is minimized and repaired, to the
extent feasible.
(e) Zoning Administrator Review and Recommendation.
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the
requirements of this Chapter. The Zoning Administrator shall inform the applicant if the application
is incomplete.
(2) If complete, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall prepare a written evaluation of the
application based on the criteria for evaluating Conditional Use Permits in Subsection (d) above. The
Zoning Administrator shall forward a copy of the application and the Zoning Administrator’s
evaluation to the Plan Commission (or Joint Committee if the subject property is within the
Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction).
(f) Public Hearing. Following acceptance of a complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall
schedule a public hearing before the Plan Commission (or Joint Committee if the subject property is
within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction), to be held within 45 days after acceptance of a complete
application. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be given by publication as a Class
2 Notice in conformance with the requirements of Sections 62.23(7)(d) and (de) of Wisconsin Statutes.
The Zoning Administrator shall also send said notice to the applicant, owners of record of all lands
within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property, and the Clerk of any municipality whose
boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of the jurisdiction of this Chapter at least ten days prior
to the date of such public hearing. Failure to mail said notice or failure to meet the time requirements
herein, provided it is unintentional, shall not invalidate proceedings under this Section. The Plan
Commission (or Joint Committee if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction)
shall hold the public hearing on all proposed Conditional Use Permits. At the public hearing, the
applicant may appear in person or by agent.
(g) Review and Action by the Plan Commission or Joint Committee.
(1) Within 60 days after the public hearing (or within an extension of said period requested in writing by
the applicant and granted by the Plan Commission or the Joint Committee if within the
Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction), the Plan Commission (or the Joint Committee if the subject
property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) shall take final action. Any action on the
Conditional Use Permit requires a majority vote of Plan Commission (or Joint Committee if the
subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) members in attendance.
(2) Prior to taking action on a Conditional Use Permit application, the Plan Commission (or the Joint
Committee if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) may request
further information and/or additional reports from the Zoning Administrator, the applicant, outside
experts and/or any other source.

(3) The Plan Commission (or the Joint Committee if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial
Zoning Jurisdiction) may approve the conditional use as originally proposed, may approve the
Conditional Use Permit with conditions or modifications, or may deny approval of the Conditional
Use Permit and include reasons for denial.
(h) Effect of Denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted
for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or
proof of change of factors relative to the review criteria in subsection (d) that are found valid by the
Zoning Administrator.

Chapter and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.
(j) Duration and Transfer. The Commission or Committee may approve a Conditional Use Permit with a
limitation on the Permit’s duration, transfer, or both if such limitation(s) relate to the purpose of this
Chapter and the conditional use permit review criteria in subsection (d). Unless the Commission or
Committee approved a Conditional Use Permit with a transfer limitation, or Section 10-1-0310 prescribes
a transfer limitation for the particular conditional use, all requirements of the approved Conditional Use
Permit shall be continued regardless of ownership or operation of the subject property or use and shall
run with the land.
(k) Recording and Notice of Conditional Use Permit or Denial. Except for Conditional Use Permit
approvals for temporary uses, the Zoning Administrator shall record and provide to the applicant the
approved Conditional Use Permit. Said Permit shall contain an identifiable description of the use and

(1) The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations that govern the procedure and requirements for
the review and approval, or denial, of proposed temporary uses, as described in this Chapter.
(2) Temporary uses are those uses that have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby
properties if allowed on a permanent basis under the general requirements of this Chapter. Owing to
their varied nature, temporary uses also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby
properties that potentially cannot be determined except on a case-by-case basis. In order to prevent
undesirable outcomes, all temporary uses are required to meet certain procedural requirements of this
Section in addition to the general requirements of Article 3 and the requirements of the zoning
district in which the subject property is located.
(3) Allowable Temporary Uses permitted within each zoning district are listed in Article 3 of this
Chapter.
(b) Regulations Applicable to All Temporary Uses. No public hearing is required to review a temporary
use that is permitted by right in the zoning district, however, a demonstration that the applicant proposes
to meet all temporary use requirements of this Article must be made at time of application. Any
temporary use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this Chapter shall be considered in
violation of this Code and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.
(c) Application Requirements. All applications for proposed temporary uses shall be approved as
complete by the Zoning Administrator prior to certification of the proposed temporary use. Said
complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(1) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the temporary use is proposed, and all
other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property. Said map shall clearly indicate
the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains
that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly
reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800
feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided.
(2) A map, such as the Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive Plan, of the generalized location of
the subject property in relation to the Village as a whole.
(3) A written description of the proposed temporary use describing the type of activities, buildings, and
structures proposed for the subject property and their general locations.
(4) The Zoning Administrator may require a site plan of the subject property. Said site plan shall
conform with requirements of Section 10-1-1307 deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to
evaluate the application.
(5) Any required fee as stated in the Schedule of Fees (Section 10-1-1318).
(d) Action by the Zoning Administrator. Action on an allowable temporary use shall be taken by the
Zoning Administrator within five days of a complete application. Such action may include approval,
conditional approval to meet the requirements of this Chapter, or denial if compliance with this Chapter
cannot be achieved.

ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-15
(1) If the requested building permit is limited to construction or modification of an accessory structure
that is less than 250 square feet in floor area, or a parking lot that will add 10 or fewer spaces, the
Zoning Administrator may, at his or her discretion, review and act on the site plan administratively.

ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-16
(e) Fee. A fee may be required for this procedure, as established by the Village Board.
Section 10-1-1309: Variance Procedures
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which enable a hearing and decision on
requests for permitted variation from the terms of this Chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest; where owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter would
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this Chapter shall be observed,
public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; as provided for by Section 62.23(7)(e)(7)
of Wisconsin Statutes.
(b) Initiation of Request for Approval of a Variance. Proceedings for approval of a requested variance
shall be initiated by an application of the owner(s) or their authorized agent of the subject property.
(c) Application Requirements. The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is
complete and fulfills the requirements of this Chapter. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the
application is not complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this Chapter, he shall return the
application to the applicant. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application is complete, he
shall so notify applicant and commence the procedure described in this Section. No placement of the
application on any agenda, as an item to be acted upon, shall occur unless said certification has occurred.
Prior to the submittal of the Official Notice regarding the application to the newspaper by the Village, the
applicant shall submit one easily reproducible electronic copy of the complete application and paper
copies if required by the Zoning Administrator. Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the
following:
(1) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the variance is proposed, and all other
lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names and
addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current records of the
Register of Deeds (as determined by the Village of Prairie du Sac). Said map shall clearly indicate the
current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that
control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly
reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800
feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided.
(2) A map, such as the Future Land Use Map within the Comprehensive Plan, of the generalized
location of the subject property in relation to the Village and Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction as a
whole.
(3) A written description of the proposed variance describing the type of specific requirements of the
variance proposed for the subject property.
(4) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to any
and all the requirements of Section 10-1-1304.
(5) Written justification for the requested variance consisting of the reasons why the applicant believes
the proposed variance is appropriate, particularly as evidenced by compliance with the criteria set out
in Subsection (d) below.
(d) Criteria for Grant of a Variance. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Board of Appeals (or Board of Extraterritorial Zoning Appeals if the subject property is within the
Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) that all of the following criteria have been met.
(1) An exceptional or extraordinary circumstance or special factors are present on the subject property,
which are not present on most other properties in the same zoning district. The applicant shall clearly
indicate how the subject property contains factors which are not present on most other properties in
the same zoning district. Specifically:
VILLAGE OF PRAIRIE DU SAC ZONING ORDINANCE OCTOBER 3, 2019
Section 10-1-1309: Variance Procedures through Section 10-1-1309: Variance Procedures
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-17
a. The hardship or difficulty shall be peculiar to the subject property and different from that of
other properties, and not one which affects all properties similarly. Such a hardship or
difficulty shall have arisen because of the unusual shape of the original lot; unusual
topography or elevation; or because the lot was created before the passage of the current,
applicable zoning regulations, and is not economically suitable for a permitted use or will not
accommodate a structure of reasonable design for a permitted use if all area, yard, green
space, and setback requirements are observed;
b. Loss of profit or pecuniary hardship shall not, in and of itself, be grounds for a variance;
c. Self-imposed hardship shall not be grounds for a variance. Reductions resulting from the
sale of portions of a property reducing the remainder of said property below buildable size
or cutting-off existing access to a public right-of-way or deed restrictions imposed by the
owner’s predecessor in title are considered to be such self-imposed hardships;
d. Violations by, or variances granted to, neighboring properties shall not justify a variance;
e. The alleged hardship shall not be one that would have existed in the absence of a zoning
ordinance. (For example, if a lot were unbuildable because of topography in the absence of
any or all setback requirements.)
(2) The factors identified in Subsection (d)(1) above would unreasonably prevent the property owner
from using the subject property for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity with this
Chapter unnecessarily burdensome. The applicant shall clearly indicate how the requested variance
makes the subject property developable so that property rights enjoyed by the owners of similar
properties can be enjoyed by the owners of the subject property.
(3) The granting of the proposed variance shall not impose a substantial detriment to adjacent
properties. The applicant shall clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial
detriment on adjacent properties.
(4) The proposed variance would make the subject property developable so that property rights enjoyed
by the owners of similar properties can be enjoyed by the owners of the subject property.
(5) The granting of the proposed variance would not result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on
the character of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public
improvements, public property or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety,
or general welfare, either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of
the implementation of the intent, provisions, and policies of this Chapter, the Comprehensive Plan,
or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official
notice by the Village or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and
development.
(6) The factors which present the reason for the proposed variance have not been created by the act of
the application or previous property owner or their agent (for example: previous development
decisions such as building placement, floor plan, or orientation, lot configurations, or grading) after
August 18, 2011. The applicant shall clearly indicate that such factors existed prior to August 18,
2011 and were not created by action of the applicant, a previous property owner, or their agent.
(7) The proposed variance does not involve or result in a land use that is not allowed in the zoning
district under Article 3 of this Chapter. The applicant shall clearly indicate that the requested variance
does not involve exceptions to the allowable land uses of that Article.
(e) Review by the Zoning Administrator. The requested variance shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator as follows:
VILLAGE OF PRAIRIE DU SAC ZONING ORDINANCE OCTOBER 3, 2019
Section 10-1-1309: Variance Procedures through Section 10-1-1309: Variance Procedures
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-18
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the
requirements of this Chapter. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application is not
complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this Chapter, he shall return the application to the
Applicant.
(2) When complete, the Zoning Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment
on the written justification for the proposed variance based on the application and the criteria for
variance approval in Subsection (d) above. The Zoning Administrator may also evaluate the
application to determine whether the request is in harmony with the recommendations of the
Comprehensive Plan.
(3) The Zoning Administrator shall forward the application and evaluation report to the Zoning Board
of Appeals (or Board of Extraterritorial Zoning Appeals if the subject property is within the
Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) for that Board’s review and action. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of this Chapter and
Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
(f) Review and Determination.
(1) Within 30 days after filing of the complete application as determined by the Zoning Administrator,
the Zoning Board of Appeals (or Board of Extraterritorial Zoning Appeals if the subject property is
within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) shall hold a public hearing. Notice of the requested
variance and the public hearing shall conform to the requirements of Section 62.23(7)(d) of
Wisconsin Statutes. Said notice shall contain a description of the subject property and the proposed
variance per Subsections (3)(a) and (c), above. In addition, at least ten days before said public
hearing, the Village shall mail an identical notice to the applicant of the proposed variance; to the
Clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of the subject
property; and to all property owners within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property.
Failure to mail said notice, provided it is unintentional, shall not invalidate proceedings under this
Section.
(2) Within 30 days after the holding of the public hearing or, within an extension of said period
approved by the applicant and granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals (or Board of Extraterritorial
Zoning Appeals if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction), the
appropriate Board shall make its findings based on the criteria in Subsection (d) above, and its
determination regarding the application as a whole. The appropriate Board may request further
information and/or additional reports from the Zoning Administrator and/or the Applicant. The
appropriate Board may take final action on said request for approval of the requested variance at
time of its initial meeting, or said proceedings may be continued from time-to-time for further
consideration. The appropriate Board shall make a written report of its findings and determinations
following its determination.
(3) If the appropriate Board fails to make a determination within 30 days after said public hearing, then
the request for the variance shall be considered denied.
(4) Said report shall include a formal finding of facts developed and approved by the appropriate Board
concerning the requirements of Subsection (d) above.
(g) Effect of Denial. No application for a variance which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be
resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new
evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
(h) Limited Effect of a Variance. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals (or Board of Extraterritorial Zoning
Appeals if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) has granted a variance,
such approval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor give it any status
VILLAGE OF PRAIRIE DU SAC ZONING ORDINANCE OCTOBER 3, 2019
Section 10-1-1310: Interpretations through Section 10-1-1310: Interpretations
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-19
as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting of a variance
shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed as precedent for any
other proposed variance.
(i) Time Limits on the Development Associated with a Variance. Construction associated with each
approved variance shall be initiated within 365 days of its approval and completed within 730 days
following its approval, unless a different period of time is established by the Board of Zoning Appeals (or
Board of Extraterritorial Zoning Appeals if the subject property is within the extraterritorial jurisdiction)
in its approval of the variance. Failure to initiate and complete construction within this period shall
automatically result in the expiration of the variance. Prior to such expiration, the applicant may request
an extension of this period. Said request shall require approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals (or Board
of Extraterritorial Zoning Appeals if the subject property is within the extraterritorial jurisdiction).
(j) Stay of Proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furthering
enforcement of any provisions of this Chapter from which the Applicant is requesting a variance, unless
the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals (or Board of Extraterritorial Zoning
Appeals if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction) after the request for the
variance has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals (or the Board of Extraterritorial
Zoning Appeals if the subject property is within the Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction), or by a Court of
Record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown. State Law
Reference: Section 62.23(7)(e)5., Wisconsin Statutes.
(k) Fee. A fee may be required for this procedure, as established by the Village Board.
Section 10-1-1310: Interpretations
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the
provisions of this Chapter, and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation.
(b) Initiation of Request for an Interpretation. Proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by the
Village Board, Plan Commission, Joint Committee, or by application from an owner(s) or leaseholder of
property within the Village or its Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction.

procedure shall not occur until the Zoning Administrator has certified acceptance of the complete
application to the Village Clerk. No placement of the application on any agenda, as an item to be acted
upon, shall occur unless said certification has occurred. Prior to the submittal of the Official Notice
regarding the application to the newspaper by the Village Clerk, the applicant shall provide the Village
Clerk one electronic copy of the complete application and paper copies if required by the Village Clerk.
Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(1) All requests for interpretations shall clearly indicate the part of the text of this Chapter for which the
interpretation is requested and the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text.
(2) If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this Chapter to a specific property, the
additional following information shall be required:
a. A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the interpretation is requested, and all
other lands within 200 feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names
and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current records
of the Register of Deeds as provided by the Village. Said map shall clearly indicate the current
zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that
control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly

reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals
800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be
provided.
b. A map, such as the Future Land Use Map within the Comprehensive Plan, of the generalized
location of the subject property in relation to the Village and Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction

interpretation relates to type of activities, buildings, and structures currently located on, and
proposed for, the subject property.
d. Any existing site plan which accurately reflects the current conditions of the property with
sufficient details relevant to the inquiry. If none exists or if the inquiry involves a proposed
change to the site, a site plan conforming to any and all the requirements of Section 10-1-1307.
(3) If the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under
the provisions of this Chapter, a series of written responses to the following questions:
a. How is the subject land use (in general) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies
and standards of the Comprehensive Plan, this Chapter, and any other plan, program, or
ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the Village?
b. How is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and
standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought?
c. Do the potential public benefits of the proposed interpretation outweigh any and all potential
adverse impacts of the proposed interpretation?
(d) Review by Zoning Administrator.
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the
requirements of this Chapter. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application is not
complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this Chapter, he shall return the application to the
Applicant. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application is complete, he shall so notify
Applicant.
(2) Upon notifying the Applicant that the application is complete, and within 30 days of such filing, the
Zoning Administrator shall review the application and shall evaluate and comment on the written
justification for the proposed interpretation provided in the application. This review shall also take
into consideration the standards for review presented in Subsection (c), below. The Zoning
Administrator shall also evaluate the application to determine whether the requested is in harmony
with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan.
(e) Standards for Review of Requested Interpretations.
This Chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the
Village Board as noted in this Chapter and the Comprehensive Plan. To this end, the Zoning
Administrator shall proceed as follows:
(1) Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation is required.
(2) Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in design and
prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public.
(3) Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the
landowner and all others who will be affected by that person’s land use proposal.
VILLAGE OF PRAIRIE DU SAC ZONING ORDINANCE OCTOBER 3, 2019
Section 10-1-1310: Interpretations through Section 10-1-1310: Interpretations
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-21
(4) This Chapter has been adopted by the Village Board to balance public goals, the protection of
adjoining property owners, and the rights of property owners to use their land for a variety of uses
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The Zoning Administrator should not substitute his own
judgments for the legislative acts of the Village Board.
(5) In addition to the applicant’s response to the questions required by Subsection (c) above, the
following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use
interpretation matters:
a. No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered
and rejected by the Village Board on an application for an amendment to the text of this
Chapter, the Official Zoning Map, or a previously applied for appeal from a requested
interpretation.
b. No interpretation shall allow a land use in any district other than those listed as allowable within
each district or permit such use without meeting all review and approval procedures specified for
that use.
c. No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which
demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to
development in the zoning district.
d. No interpretation shall permit a land use not specifically allowed in the particular zoning district
unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more
similar to such other permitted uses than to uses either not permitted in said district, or uses
requiring a Conditional Use Permit. If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use
permitted only as a conditional use in the subject property’s district than to a use permitted by
right, then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a
Conditional Use Permit pursuant to Section 10-1-1304.
(f) Effect of a Favorable Land Use Interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to be
permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment
of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or
structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of
applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this Chapter. These permits and
approvals include, but are not limited to required site plans, special use permits, conditional uses, and
Certificates of Occupancy.
(g) Limitations on Favorable Land Use Interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to
be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more
than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation, unless a Building Permit is issued and
development is actually begun within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a
Certificate of Occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period. An interpretation finding
a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be
deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was
issued. The interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate
interpretation has not been issued. A favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of
any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a
period of 365 consecutive days or more.
(h) Fee. An Interpretation Fee may be required, as determined by the Village Board.

Section 10-1-1319: Park Land and Recreation Improvement Impact Fees
(a) Purpose. This section is intended to impose park land and recreation improvement impact fees for new
dwelling units constructed within the Village limits. Such fees are intended to finance the acquisition of
park land and the improvement of park and recreational facilities, the demand for which is generated by
new dwelling units. Collected fees shall be used to finance capital costs for new, enlarged or improved
capital improvements that substantially benefit those dwelling units that pay the fees. The park land
impact fee and recreation improvement impact fee described in this section have been imposed under,
and are authorized by, Sec. 66.0617, Wis. Stats., which is Wisconsin’s authorizing legislation for
development impact fees.
(b) Timing. The impact fees described in this section shall be paid at the time of issuance of each building
permit, except that a development agreement under Section 10-1-1006 or under 10-3-0703 of the
subdivision and land division regulations may specify fee payment at an earlier date. As used in this
subsection, the term “building permit” shall not include permits required for remodeling, rehabilitation,

Fees through

Fees
ARTICLE 13: PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 13-26
or other improvements to an existing structure, or for rebuilding or replacing a removed, damaged, or
destroyed structure, where no increase in the number of dwelling units results.
Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, if the total amount of impact fees due is more than $75,000, a
developer may defer payment of the impact fees for a period of 4 years from the date of the issuance of
the building permit or until 6 months before the Village incurs the costs to construct, expand, or improve
the public facilities related to the development for which the fee was imposed, whichever is earlier. If the
developer elects to defer payment under this paragraph, the developer shall maintain in force a bond or
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of the unpaid fees executed in the name of the Village. A
developer may not defer payment of impact fees for projects that have been previously approved.
(c) Amounts. The park land impact fee shall be $650 per dwelling unit. The recreation improvement impact
feet shall be $1,250 per dwelling unit.
(d) Basis. The fee amounts in subsection (c) are per the public facility needs assessment adopted pursuant to
Resolution #09-24-2019(a) and on file with the Village Clerk. The adopted needs assessment shall also be
used as the basis for expenditure of collected impact fees pursuant to this section. At the time the Village
collects each impact fee, it shall provide to the applicant or developer from which it received the fee an
accounting of how the fee will be spent, which may be the needs assessment or a summary thereof.
(e) Accounting. The Village Treasurer shall place all collected impact fees in separate segregated interestbearing
accounts, which shall be accounted for separately from the other Village funds. Each collected
fee shall be identified by parcel number and date paid within the fund. Impact fee revenues and interest
earned on impact fee revenues may be expended only for the particular capital costs for which the impact
fee was imposed, unless the fee is refunded under subsection (g).
(f) Potential Waiver or Reduction. The fee amounts under subsection (c) may be waived or reduced in
one or more of the following circumstances:
(1) By the Zoning Administrator, where the development that includes the dwelling unit dedicated
public park land pursuant to the requirement in Section 10-3-0902 of the subdivision and land
division regulations, with the reduction proportionate to the extent that the full requirement was met
by such dedication.
(2) By the Zoning Administrator, where the developer improved public park land in the development
that includes the dwelling unit pursuant to the improvement requirement in Section 10-3-0903(b)(7),
with the reduction proportionate to the extent that that value of such improvements covered the
total recreation improvement impact fee that would otherwise be assigned to that development.
(3) By the Zoning Administrator, where the development within which the dwelling unit is located
provided private open space and/or recreational improvements as described in Section 10-3-0905, to
the extent the Village Board approved impact fee credits for such provision.
(4) By the Village Board, by request of the builder of the proposed dwelling unit, where it determines
that their imposition would have a substantial adverse effect on the availability of housing intended
to be affordable to those below the median household income in Sauk County. The substantial
adverse effect must be supported by evidence provided by the builder.
For any waiver or reduction associated with a development approved after August 1, 2019, the Village
Board shall have first entered into a development agreement with the developer, which shall specify the
land dedication, private open space, and/or improvements to be provided, the cost thereof, and the
amount of credit granted against the impact fees. In no event shall the Village provide a credit that is
greater than either the impact fees otherwise due or the fair market value of the land or improvements
provided. Any decision to allow a developer to provide land dedication, private open space, and/or
improvements in lieu of or to reduce impact fees shall rest in the sole discretion of the Village Board.

(g) Refunds. Any collected impact fee that is not used within 8 years after it is collected to pay the capital
costs for which it was imposed shall be refunded to the payer of such fee, along with any interest that has
accumulated.
(h) Appeals. A developer or an applicant for a building permit may appeal the amount, collection, or use of
the impact fees, and any property owner may appeal a decision on a claim for refund of unexpended
impact fees, under the provisions of Chapter 68, Wis. Stats. If the notice of appeal challenges the
imposition of an impact fee, or the amount imposed, the developer or applicant may pay the fees
imposed under protest and the building inspector shall issue any building permits withheld solely due to
the nonpayment of the fees. If the applicant prevails on appeal, the Village Treasurer shall refund that
portion of the fees so paid as finally determined in the appeal process.
Section 10-1-1320: Violations and Penalties
(a) Violations. It shall be unlawful to construct or use any structure, land, or water anywhere within the
Village or its Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction in violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter. In
case of any violation, the Village Board, the Plan Commission or Joint Committee, Zoning
Administrator, or any person who would be specifically damaged by such violation may institute
appropriate action or proceeding to enjoin a violation of this Chapter.

upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00 and costs of prosecution
for each violation and in default of payment of such forfeiture and costs shall be imprisoned in the
County Jail until payment thereof, but not exceeding 30 days. Each day a violation exists or continues
shall constitute a separate offense. Any person, firm or corporation who commences an activity described
in this Chapter without payment of the associated application fee is also subject to penalty under Section
10-1-1318(c).
(c) Prairie du Sac Promulgated Correction of Violation. In addition to any other penalty imposed by this
Subchapter for a violation of the provisions of this Chapter, the Village reserves and maintains the
continued right to abate violations of this Chapter.
(1) Hazardous Condition Caused by Violation of this Chapter. If the Zoning Administrator determines
that a violation of this Chapter exists, and further determines that the nature of such violation poses
a great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, the Zoning
Administrator shall cause the violation to be abated. Costs associated with said abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the property on which said violation has occurred. The Zoning
Administrator is hereby authorized to abate a violation of this Chapter.
(2) Non-Hazardous Condition Caused by Violation of this Chapter. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that a violation of this Chapter exists, and further determines that the nature of such
violation is not such as to pose great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals
or decency, the Zoning Administrator shall serve written notice by registered mail on the current
owner of the property (as indicated by current Village of Prairie du Sac tax records) on which said
violation is occurring to remove said violation within ten working days. If such violation is not
removed within such ten working days, the Zoning Administrator shall cause the violation to be
abated per Subsection (a), above. Costs associated with said abatement shall be charged to the owner
of the property on which said violation has occurred.
(3) Cost of Abatement. In addition to any other penalty imposed by this Subchapter for a violation of
the provisions of this Chapter, the cost of abating a violation of this Chapter shall be collected as a
debt from the owner of the property on which said violation has occurred. An account of the
expenses incurred by the Village to abate the violation shall be kept and such expenses shall be
charged to and paid by the property owner. Notice of the bill for abatement of the violation shall be

villages and cities; and the requirements in s. 87.30, Stats.
Sec. 10-2-2 FINDING OF FACT
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality
would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
Sec. 10-2-3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(c) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(d) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(f) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(g) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(h) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in
conflicts between property owners; and
(i) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to
locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
Sec. 10-2-4 TITLE
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village of

Sec. 10-2-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS
(a) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or
base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps
approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on
the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional
Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one
map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(b) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or
A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any
change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the
floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of
Map Change process (see Article H Amendments) before it is effective. No
changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the
DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Village Clerk,
Village of Prairie du Sac. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the
most restrictive information shall apply.
(1) OFFICIAL MAPS : Based on the FIS: Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM), panel numbers 55111C0561F and 55111C0562F, dated October
2, 2015; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) dated October 2, 2015, volumes 55111CV001C
and 55111CV002C; Approved by: The DNR and FEMA
(c) ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN ZONING DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(1) The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the
FIRM.
(2) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood
limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
(3) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be
covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE
or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on
the FIRM.
(d) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and
actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subd (1) or (2)
below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to
Article H, Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary
derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or
not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible
for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon
which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map
amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning
administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled
according to Sec. 10-2-72(c) and the criteria in (1) and (2) below. Where the
flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM,
FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Article H,
Amendments.
(1) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(2) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
(e) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the
regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Article H, Amendments.
(f) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in
compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and
federal regulations.
(g) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are
required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when s. 30.2022, Stats.,
applies.
(h) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(1) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under s. 61.35 or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to
floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(2) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(i) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the
minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and
are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in
effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the
most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(j) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering
experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or
guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from
flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part
of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(k) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected.
(l) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES
The Sauk County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed
areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the
requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the
municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on
file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of
annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

and subsequent models must be supported by
certified topographic information, bridge plans,
construction plans and survey notes.
vi. Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited
to the stream reach for which the revision is
being requested. Cross sections upstream and
downstream of the revised reach shall be
identical to those in the effective model and
result in water surface elevations and top widths
computed by the revised models matching those
in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required.
The Effective Model shall not be truncated.

inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain and
that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or
proposed buildings.
(aaaa) REGIONAL FLOOD – A flood determined to be representative of large floods
known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one

date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction
on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include
the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
(cccc) STRUCTURE – Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either
permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground,
stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings,

the damage occurred.
(ffff) SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT – Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial
damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the
work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the
improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety
code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure.
(gggg) UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP – Where special conditions affecting a particular
property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with
restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily
burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.
(hhhh) VARIANCE – An authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the
construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is
inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain
zoning ordinance.
(iiii) VIOLATION – The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other
development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation,
floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

on the developability of the land. The subdivider shall submit a scale map of the area proposed for
division along with the completed form.
(c) Determination of Need for Further Information. Upon receipt of a completed site assessment
checklist, the Zoning Administrator may, for reasons stated in written correspondence setting forth
specific questions on which it requires research, data, and input from the subdivider and other
persons, require that the subdivider submit further information to explain concerns raised from
information included in or absent from the site assessment checklist. Failure to submit such additional
information in a timeframe specified in the Zoning Administrator’s request shall be grounds for
denial of the associated plat or certified survey map.
(d) Use of Completed Site Assessment Checklist and Further Information. The completed site
assessment checklist and any attached or further information, along with the Zoning Administrator’s
assessment of those materials, will be considered in the determination of the suitability of the land for

general intent of the subdivider or condominium developer in terms of general layout of the
subdivision, or condominium development and its relationship to nearby properties, roads, utilities
and other public facilities. In conjunction with the site assessment checklist, the concept plan provides
an opportunity to review the general intent and impact of the proposed division or condominium
development without the need for detailed engineering, surveying, and other time consuming and
costly processes associated with preparation of a plat or certified survey map.
(b) Required Coverage and Contents. The concept plan shall be a map that includes all contiguous land
owned or controlled by the subdivider. A complete concept plan shall depict the general layout of the
proposed subdivision or condominium development, including existing and proposed building sites,
roads, major public utilities, parks, open spaces, and general proposed land use patterns; and represent
relationships to nearby properties and land uses. The concept plan may rely on and refer to a detailed
neighborhood development plan prepared by or for the Village to provide direction on proposed
layout. For a traditional neighborhood development or planned unit development, the required general
development plan may serve as the concept plan.

misleading information pertaining to past projects or contractual obligations, the Village will not
accept an application for approval of a plat until the subdivider’s statement is corrected, or consider
an associated application for certified survey map approval complete. If the subdivider’s statement or
Zoning Administrator review thereof indicates outstanding obligations, the Village will not accept an
application for approval of a plat, or consider an associated application for certified survey map
approval complete, until the obligations have been fulfilled.

(a) CSM Submittal to Village. A subdivider of a proposed land division shall submit with the Zoning
Administrator an application for CSM approval. The submittal shall include hard copies in quantities
specified on the application form and a digital PDF copy of the completed application, the CSM, and
all supplemental materials under Section 10-3-0504. A complete CSM application shall be required at
least 14 days prior to the date of the Plan Commission or Joint Extraterritorial Committee meeting at
which a recommendation is expected. Upon the submittal of a CSM served by new or extended
Village infrastructure, the Village may require that the subdivider and Village begin negotiations on a
development agreement specifying responsibilities of both parties, as described in Section 10-3-0903.
(b) CSM Submittal to Other Agencies. The subdivider shall be responsible for providing each CSM to
State, County, Town, and other agencies as may be required by Chapter 236, Wis. Stats., and by other
applicable law.
(c) Staff Review of CSM.
(1) For Minor Land Divisions, the Zoning Administrator may within 20 days from the date of a
complete CSM submittal associated with a minor land division, as defined in Article 13, approve,
conditionally approve or reject said map. The Zoning Administrator shall use the requirements
included and referenced in this Chapter as the sole basis for such action. The action of the Zoning
Administrator is final, and the procedures in subsection (d) or (e) shall not apply to such CSM,
except in the following circumstances:
a. The Zoning Administrator, rather than taking action, within 20 days of a complete submittal,
instead refers the CSM to the Plan Commission, or Joint Extraterritorial Committee if in the
extraterritorial area and if Committee review is provided by intergovernmental agreement; or
b. The subdivider, within 5 days of Zoning Administrator action, appeals such action to the Plan
Commission, or to Joint Extraterritorial Committee if in the extraterritorial area and if
Committee review is provided by intergovernmental agreement.
(2) For all other land divisions aside from Minor Land Divisions, the Zoning Administrator shall
provide copies of the CSM and supplemental materials to the Public Works Director, Village
Engineer, Village Planner, Village Attorney, and Fire Chief for comment and recommendation.
Such recommendations shall be provided in a timeframe to allow consideration by the Plan
Commission or Joint Extraterritorial Committee. The Zoning Administrator or designee shall
provide required review bodies with his or her opinion on whether the CSM conforms to
applicable Village ordinances and statutes, and shall provide a recommendation on approval of
the CSM. The opinion and recommendation shall be part of the record of the proceedings at
which the CSM is being considered.
(d) Village Plan Commission Action. Except as provided under subsections (c)(1) or (e), the Plan
Commission shall review the CSM for conformance with this Chapter and all other applicable
ordinances and statutes, and shall take action in only one of the following two ways:
(1) Within 60 days from the date of a complete application submittal, the Commission shall
approve, conditionally approve, or reject any CSM that does not propose the dedication of any

public land or infrastructure to the Village; or
(2) Within 45 days from the date of a complete application submittal, the Commission shall
recommend Village Board approval, conditional approval, or rejection of any CSM that
proposes the dedication of public lands or infrastructure to the Village. The Commission shall
transmit such map along with its recommendations to the Village Board, including reasons for a
recommended rejection or any conditions on a recommended approval.
(e) CSM Review Under Intergovernmental Agreements. The Joint Extraterritorial Committee shall
function in lieu of the Plan Commission under subsection (d) with respect to CSMs within the
extraterritorial area, if, and to the extent, provided in an intergovernmental agreement between the
Village and the Town of Prairie du Sac.
(f) Village Board Action. For certified survey maps governed by subsection (d)(2), the Village Board
shall within 60 days from the date of a complete submittal, approve, conditionally approve or reject
the CSM. Village Board approval of the CSM may be conditioned upon the execution of the
development agreement under Section 10-3-0903.
(g) Review Periods and Notice of Action. The time periods within which action on a CSM is required
under subsections (c) through (f) shall not commence until the Village has received a complete
application. Such time periods may be extended by written agreement of the subdivider. If the
approval authority designated under subsections (c) through (f) fails to act on such CSM within the
indicated time period, the period of time has not been extended by agreement, and no unsatisfied
objections have been filed within that period, the CSM shall be deemed approved. If the map is
rejected or conditionally approved, the reasons for rejection or conditions of approval shall be stated
in the minutes of the meeting, and a written statement shall be forwarded to the subdivider.
(h) Recordation of CSM. The CSM shall be submitted for recording with the county Register of Deeds
within 6 months from the date of the last approval and within 24 months from the date of the first
approval, or the Village approval shall be deemed void. No CSM shall be submitted for recording
until the Village Clerk has inscribed his or her certification of Village approval on the CSM. The
Village Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the CSM attesting to such approval to be duly
executed and the plat returned to the subdivider for recording, upon verification of the following:
(1) CSM approval under this Section.
(2) Satisfaction of all conditions imposed by that approval to the extent possible.
(3) Village Engineer approval of final engineering plans, if any.
(4) A development agreement under Section 10-3-0703 has been signed by the subdivider and
Village, if such an agreement was required.
(5) Payment of all required fees under this Chapter and other chapters of the Municipal Code.
(i) Recordation of Other Documents. All required deed restrictions, protective covenants, property
owners’ association organizational documents, and development agreement shall be recorded prior to,

SUBDIVISION AND LAND DIVISION REGULATIONS 10/03/2019
Page 20 ARTICLE 6: DESIGN STANDARDS
ARTICLE 6: DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 10-3-0601: Applicability
The provisions of this Article apply to all subdivisions and land divisions as defined in Article 13, except
where limited by law within the extraterritorial area and elsewhere by this Chapter, other Village
ordinances, and applicable law. Where the application of this Article is limited by law in the
extraterritorial area, streets shall meet or exceed town road improvement standards in Section 86.26,
Wisconsin Statutes or Town of Prairie du Sac standards, except where the Village and Town have entered
an intergovernmental agreement that requires that the provisions of this Article apply.
Section 10-3-0602: Street Arrangement and Classification
(a) Conformance with Village Plans and Ordinances. In any new subdivision, land division, or
condominium development, the layout of public streets, bikeways, and pedestrian paths shall
substantially conform to the arrangement and location indicated on the official map, Comprehensive
Outdoor Recreation Plan, and Comprehensive Plan including neighborhood development plan
components.
(b) General Arrangement Criteria. The street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the
various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed
streets, the topography, such natural features as streams and mature trees, the future land to be served
by such streets, the most advantageous development of adjoining areas, and an overall objective of an
interconnected public street network in the community.
(c) Determination of Street Functional Classification. The functional classification of various types of
streets within and adjacent to each subdivision, land division, or condominium development shall be
determined by the Village Engineer based on following criteria:
(1) Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide for through traffic and ready access to centers of
employment, centers of governmental activity, shopping areas, major recreation areas, and points
beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related
to the existing and proposed system of arterial streets and highways, and shall be, insofar as
practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to
connect. Arterial streets include all county, state, and federal highways.
(2) Collector streets shall be arranged to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and
conveyance of this traffic to arterial streets and highways. Collector streets shall also connect to
special traffic generators such as schools, churches, and shopping centers and other
concentrations of population.
(3) Subcollector streets shall be arranged to direct traffic from minor streets within a land division,
subdivision, or condominium development to the arterial and collector street network.
Subcollector streets shall also be designed to provide connectivity between adjoining subdivision
or condominium developments and to neighborhood facilities such as parks and schools.
(4) Minor streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, discourage use by through traffic,
permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and require the minimum
street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. Not every street
within a subdivision, land division, or condominium development is necessarily a minor street.
The designation of a street as a minor street does not imply that it should be a cul-de-sac or
otherwise not extend beyond the boundaries of the subdivision.
(5) Alleys may be provided for off-street loading and service access. Dead-end alleys without a
proper turn-around shall not be approved, and alleys shall not connect to an arterial street. Alleys
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DIVISION REGULATIONS 10/03/2019
Page 21 ARTICLE 6: DESIGN STANDARDS
may be provided in traditional neighborhood development districts to service garages and for
refuse collection. All alleys must be paved with asphalt or other hard surfacing.
Section 10-3-0603: Street Extensions
Proposed street rights-of-way shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided or
developed unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the
appropriate Village approval authority, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination
of the layout of the subdivision, land division, or condominium development or for the advantageous
development of the adjacent tracts.
Section 10-3-0604: Street Names
(a) Procedure. The subdivider shall propose names of all new and extended public streets on the face of
the plat or certified survey map, with all street names subject to Village Board approval as part of the
approval of a final plat or certified survey map.
(b) Standards. Street names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names in the zip codes that
encompass the Village of Prairie du Sac, the Village of Sauk City, and their extraterritorial areas.
Streets that are or are planned to be continuations of others already in existence and named shall bear
the name of the existing street, except where otherwise required by intergovernmental agreement or
approved by the Village Board. The following matters shall be considered when naming any street:
(1) All north-south streets between the Wisconsin River and Highway 12 shall be called “streets” and
shall be numbered accordingly to a system available from the Village Engineer.
(2) Any notable geologic, geographic, cultural, biographical, historical, botanical, horticultural,
scientific, or other factors or events associated with the area served by the street.
(3) The appropriateness of honoring or showing gratitude to a person, group or event deserving of
recognition within the community or the greater Sauk Prairie area.
Section 10-3-0605: Design Standards Adjacent to Arterial Streets, Collector Streets, Railroads
(a) Access Control. Subdivisions, land divisions, and condominium developments shall be designed in
such a manner that there shall be no direct access to arterial streets from newly created residential lots
and to otherwise meet access and visibility standards in Section 10-1-0808 of the zoning ordinance.
(b) Streets Parallel to Arterial Streets. The subdivider may be required to provide marginal access or
service streets including those that are approximately parallel to, and at a suitable distance from,
arterial streets and railroads. Marginal access streets and service drives may be required to facilitate
the free flow of traffic along arterial streets and highways, and to encourage the appropriate use of the
land between same. Minor streets running generally parallel and immediately adjacent to arterial
streets and railroads shall be avoided in residential zoning districts.
(c) Landscaped Buffer Strips. Where proposed residential lots back upon the right-of-way of an
existing or proposed arterial street, limited access highway, or railroad right-of-way, a landscape
buffer strip of at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the zoning
district shall be provided adjacent to the arterial street, railroad right-of-way, or limited access
highway. The treatment within this landscaped buffer strip shall be unified along the entire frontage
in accordance with a landscape plan prepared by the subdivider and approved by the Village. The
treatment should consider noise mitigation. This strip shall be a permanently reserved part of the
platted lots and shall be designated with a note on the plat or CSM as follows: “NOTE: The ___ foot
landscaped buffer strip is reserved for the planting of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation, with the
associated property owner responsible for their ongoing maintenance and replacement. The placement
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DIVISION REGULATIONS 10/03/2019
Page 22 ARTICLE 6: DESIGN STANDARDS
of structures within this strip is prohibited, except if approved by the Village Board.”
Section 10-3-0606: Street Dimensional Standards
(a) Base Dimensional Standards. The minimum right-of-way width, roadway width, sidewalk
requirements, and parking requirements for proposed public streets are as specified in Figure 10-3-
0606(1).
(b) Additional and Alternative Standards.
(1) If the Village’s official map, Comprehensive Plan, or Safe Routes to Schools Plan provides for
alternative requirements (such as different right-of-way width or an on-street bicycle lane), the
Village Engineer may substitute the alternative requirements for those listed in the table below.
(2) Extension of existing streets that exceed the standards in Figure 10-3-0606(1) shall be developed
to conform to the existing street dimension or taper to the dimensions noted in that figure, as
determined by the Village Engineer.
(3) Cross-sections for freeways, expressways, parkways, and boulevard streets shall be based upon
detailed engineering studies submitted with the subdivision plat.
(4) Where on-street bike lanes are required, the width of each bike lane shall not be less than 4 feet,
not including the gutter section. Such width shall be in addition to the width required by Figure
10-3-0606(1). Placement of bike lanes shall be in accordance with the AASHTO Guide for the
Development of Bicycle Facilities.
(5) Cul-de-sac streets designated to have one end permanently closed shall not be permitted within
the Village. Within the extraterritorial area and where streets are temporarily ended at the edges
of a plat, cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length measured from the centerline of

Section 10-3-0607: Street Grades
Street grades shall be established to avoid excessive grading, the indiscriminate removal of ground cover
and trees, and general leveling of the topography. All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of minimum length meeting AASHTO standards for vertical curve design. The minimum
centerline grade of all new streets shall in no case be less than 0.5% and no less than 0.4% for
reconstructed streets. Unless necessitated by exceptional topography subject to the approval of the Village
Engineer, the maximum centerline grade of any street or public way shall not exceed the following:
(a) Arterial Streets. 6%.
(b) Collector and Subcollector Streets. 8%.
(c) Minor Streets and Alleys. 10%.
(d) Pedestrian Ways. 12%, except where steps of acceptable design are provided.
(e) Multiuse Paths. 6%, except steeper grades may be allowed for shorter distances.
Section 10-3-0608: Street Radii of Curvature
When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one point by more than 10 degrees, a circular curve
shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on said centerline of not less than 500 feet for arterial and
collector streets, and 150 feet for subcollector and minor streets. A tangent of at least 100 feet in length
shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
Section 10-3-0609: Half-Streets and Reserve Strips
(a) Where an existing dedicated or platted half-street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other
half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of half-streets shall be avoided
unless determined necessary by the Village Board.
(b) Reserve strips of privately held lands shall not be permitted on any land division or subdivision as a
means of the land owner to control access onto a public street.
Section 10-3-0610: Street Intersections
(a) Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of
good design permit.
(b) Number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum; not more than 2
unless a safe intersection design is approved by the Village Engineer.
(c) The distance between intersections along arterial streets, except for USH 12, shall not be less than
400 feet, as measured from centerline to centerline. The distance between intersections along USH 12
shall by at least 1,200 foot spacing or shall meet WisDOT requirements, whichever is greater.
(d) Property lines at street intersections shall approximate a 90-degree angle unless an alternative
treatment is considered acceptable by the Village Engineer, and shall be rounded with a minimum
radius of 25 feet.
(e) Minor and subcollector streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or collector streets; but if
the centerlines of such minor streets approach the arterial or collector street from opposite sides
within 300 feet of each other as measured along the centerline of the arterial or collector street, then
the location shall be so adjusted that the adjoinment across the arterial or collector street is continuous
and a jog is avoided.

public street to which it may legally take access.
(e) Conformance with Zoning Dimensional Requirements. Area and width of lots shall conform to
zoning ordinance requirements. Whenever a tract is subdivided into large parcels, such parcels shall
be arranged and dimensioned as to allow re-subdivisions of any such parcels into smaller lots.
(f) Lot Depth. Lots shall have a minimum average depth of 100 feet. Excessive depth in relation to
width shall be avoided and a proportion of 2 to 1 shall be considered a desirable ratio under normal
conditions. Depth of lots reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to
provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and zoning.
(g) Waterfront Lots. Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise
unplattable lands which lie between a proposed land division, subdivision, or condominium
development and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots or public dedications in any
plat abutting a lake, river, or stream.
(h) Flag Lots. Flag lots, as defined in Article 13, shall be prohibited within the Village limits, except
where pre-existing lot or development patterns necessitates use of a flag lot. Flag lots shall be
discouraged within the extraterritorial area.

The provisions of this Article apply to all subdivisions and land divisions as defined in Article 13, except
where limited by law within the extraterritorial area and elsewhere by this Chapter, other Village
ordinances, and applicable law.
Section 10-3-0702: Determination of Adequacy of Public Facilities and Services
(a) Generally. The appropriate Village approval authority shall not approve a certified survey map,
preliminary plat, final plat, or condominium plat unless adequate public facilities and public services
are available to meet the needs of the future inhabitants of the proposed land division, subdivision, or
condominium development.
(b) Required Data from Subdivider. With or following the submittal of any preliminary plat,
condominium plat, final plat, or certified survey map, the subdivider shall furnish any data requested
by the Village Engineer related to the adequacy of public facilities and public services. The Village
Engineer shall work with the Zoning Administrator to transmit this information to appropriate Village
staff, commissions, committees, and boards for review. The Zoning Administrator shall act as
coordinator for their reports to the appropriate Village approval authority on the adequacy of water,
sanitary and storm sewers, fire service, police, parks and open space, recreation facilities, and
transportation facilities. Failure to submit such data as requested may be grounds for denial of the
preliminary plat, condominium plat, final plat, or certified survey map.
(c) Determination Criteria. Public facilities and public services for a proposed land division,
subdivision, or condominium development shall be found to be adequate by the Village when all of
the following conditions exist:
(1) Where the proposed land division, subdivision or condominium development is located within the
Village or a future annexation area by intergovernmental agreement, and main line interceptor
sewer service is presently available to the area or is designated for extension, and the subdivision
or condominium development is proposed to connect with such sanitary sewer service. The
appropriate Village approval authority shall also consider the recommendations of the Village
Engineer or sewer utility on the capacity of trunk lines and of sewerage treatment facilities and
any other information presented. All new lots within the Village must be connected to by public
sanitary sewer service.
(2) Where the proposed land division, subdivision, or condominium development is not located
within Village or a future annexation area by intergovernmental agreement, other acceptable
means of sanitary waste disposal are provided which will protect the public health, safety and

Page 35 ARTICLE 9: PARKS AND RECREATION
ARTICLE 9: PARKS AND RECREATION
Section 10-3-0901: General Provisions
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to ensure that adequate parks and other recreational sites are
properly sized, located, preserved, and improved. This Section has also been established to ensure
that the cost of providing the park and recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional
people brought into the community by land division and subdivision may be equitably apportioned on
the basis of additional needs created by such divisions.
(b) Applicability. This Section shall apply to all lands divided for new residential dwelling units within
the Village. Within the extraterritorial area, if public park and recreation site dedication is not
required for residential divisions by another jurisdiction with authority, proposed public parks and
recreation sites shall be reserved for acquisition by the Town, county, or Village at undeveloped land
costs for a period not exceeding 5 years, unless extended by mutual agreement between the
subdivider and the local government(s) with potential interest in acquiring the land. The amount of
land to be reserved shall be based on the park dedication area requirement in Section 10-3-0902.
(c) Parks Dedication and Fees, Generally. The need and location of park and recreation sites to be
dedicated shall be determined by the appropriate Village approval authority, following a
recommendation from the Village Board’s Parks Committee if the division is a plat in the Village.
Where such authority determines that park and recreation site dedication is not compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan or official map, or for other reasons is not advised by the Village, the subdivider
or building permit applicant shall, in lieu thereof, pay a park land impact fee to the Village to meet
this requirement in whole or on a pro-rata basis, per Section 10-1-1319 of the zoning ordinance.
Where park and recreation site dedication is required, the subdivider shall be responsible for
improving the park and recreation site under the terms of Section 10-3-0903. Where park and
recreational site dedication is not required, the subdivider or building permit applicant shall be
responsible for paying a recreation improvement impact fee to improve other public park and
recreational lands that will benefit the future residents of the division, in addition to a park land
impact fee, per Section 10-1-1319.
Section 10-3-0902: Park and Recreational Site Dedication
(a) Park Dedication Ratio. Where the dedication of park and recreation sites is required under this
Article, the normal amount of park and recreation site dedication shall be 1,300 square feet for each
single family unit, 1,100 square feet for each duplex unit, and 1,000 square feet for each multifamily
unit. If no particular number or type of dwelling units is proposed, the dedication requirement shall be
based on the number of dwelling units permitted by right under the proposed land division,
subdivision, or condominium development and the zoning in effect upon the approval of the plat or
certified survey map.
(b) Relationship to Comprehensive Plan and Official Map. Whenever a public park or recreation site
proposed in the Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan, or official map is
embraced, in whole or in part, in a tract of land to be divided, that proposed public park or recreation
site shall be dedicated and credited toward the requirements of subsection (a). Where a public park
and recreation site as shown on one or both of these plans or official map within the tract are greater
in area than required by dedication under subsection (a), the Village Board may require that the
subdivider reserve for acquisition by the Village, through agreement, purchase, or condemnation, the
remaining greater park area for a period of 2 years of final plat, certified survey map, or condominium
plat approval unless extended by mutual agreement. Such reserved lands shall be kept in one or more
outlots to be held by the subdivider. Over that period, the Village shall have the ability to negotiate
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DIVISION REGULATIONS 10/03/2019
Page 36 ARTICLE 9: PARKS AND RECREATION
the purchase of said land at undeveloped land prices.
(c) Other Locational Criteria. The dedicated site shall be located so as to serve the recreation and open
space needs of the division or condominium development from which the dedication was made.
Consideration shall be given in the location of such sites to the preservation of scenic and historic
sites, ridge tops, stands of fine trees, marshes, rivers, streams, ponds, prairies, and ravines. All lands
proposed to be dedicated for park purposes shall be demonstrated to present no environmental hazard,
and that they will not require environmental mitigation or remediation measures, through a phase one
environmental assessment provided by the subdivider.
(d) Minimum Park Area. Each public park shall be a minimum of 2 acres, unless otherwise approved
by the Village Board. Where the amount of land to be dedicated is less than 2 acres, the Village Board
may require that the public park be located at the edge of the proposed division so that additional land
may be added when the adjacent land is divided.
(e) Access. Public access to all park and recreation sites shall be provided by street frontage of sufficient
width to assure safe, convenient access to the dedicated land, with a minimum public street frontage
of no less than 15% of the perimeter of the park. In unique situations, the Village approval authority
may permit access via public easement to the dedicated site. The easement shall be sufficiently wide
so that maintenance equipment will have convenient access to the site
(f) Usability. The dedicated land shall be usable for recreation, as determined by the appropriate Village
approval authority. Lands dedicated for storm water management shall not be credited towards the
park and recreation site dedication requirement. Wetlands or sloped areas may be considered usable
for recreational purposes at the discretion of the approval authority. The shape of the dedicated parcel
of land shall be sufficiently square or round to be usable for recreational activities planned for the
area or the type of park intended. If the Village Board determines that a proposed dedication meets
some but not all of the usability criteria in this subsection, it may approve acceptance of that land with
partial credit to the parkland dedication requirement in subsection (a).
Section 10-3-0903: Improvement of Dedicated Park and Recreational Sites
(a) Generally. Where a public park or recreational site is included within a plat or certified survey map,
it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to improve the park or recreational site in accordance
with this Section, specifications approved by the Village Board (such as within the Comprehensive
Outdoor Recreation Plan), and a park master plan prepared by the Subdivider and approved by the
Zoning Administrator.
(b) Improvement Standards. When public park and recreation lands are dedicated to the Village, prior
to final Village acceptance of such lands, the subdivider is required to:
(1) Properly grade and contour for proper drainage.
(2) Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area.
(3) Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of 6 inches of quality topsoil, seed, fertilized, and
mulched, as specified by the Village Engineer and pursuant to the standard “Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction Section 627 and 629.” The topsoil furnished for the park or
recreational site shall consist of the natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay
loam humus-bearing soils adapted to the sustenance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither
excessively acid nor excessively alkaline. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one year
following execution of the Development Agreement, unless otherwise authorized by the Village
Board. The improved area shall not be deemed officially accepted until a uniform groundcover to
a minimum 2 inch height has been established.
(4) For natural areas include within a dedicated park or recreational site, restore the land to a natural
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DIVISION REGULATIONS 10/03/2019
Page 37 ARTICLE 9: PARKS AND RECREATION
state to the extent practicable and necessary.
(5) For each neighborhood park, provide a standard residential water service unless located directly
adjacent to a fire hydrant and provide a standard residential sewer service. For each community
park, provide a minimum 6 inch water service or at least 1 fire hydrant, and at least one 4 inch
sanitary sewer lateral, all located at the street property line.
(6) In cases where private lots adjoin the public park and recreational site, grade, sign, and/or
landscape the area along such property lines to clearly demarcate the borders between private lots
and the public site.
(7) For each park, install playground equipment and other park improvements appropriate to the type,
purpose, and location in accordance with a park master plan prepared by the subdivider and
approved by the Village Board’s Parks Committee, with the value of such equipment and other
improvements (not including those in subsections (1) through (6)) based on the recreation
improvement fee that would otherwise be required under Section 10-1-1319(c) of the zoning
ordinance.
(c) Maintenance. The subdivider shall maintain the park or recreational site until the Village accepts its
dedication, which shall include all watering, mowing, and other maintenance to maintain a neat,
clean, and living appearance. It shall be the responsibility of the Village to maintain the dedicated
areas upon their dedication and acceptance by the Village.
(d) Failure to Complete. If the subdivider fails to satisfy the requirements of this Section in a timeframe
specified by the development agreement, the Village Board may contract said completion and bill
such costs to the subdivider, following a public hearing and written notice to the subdivider of
noncompliance. Failure to pay such costs may result in the immediate withholding of building
permits within the division until such costs are paid.
Section 10-3-0904: Park Land and Recreation Improvement Impact Fees
Where the appropriate Village approval authority determines that impact fees shall be paid in lieu of
dedication and improvement of a park and recreational site, in whole or in part, such fees shall be
determined and paid pursuant to Section 10-1-1319 of the zoning ordinance.
Section 10-3-0905: Potential Credit for Private Open Space and Improvements
(a) Private Open Space Provision. Where the appropriate Village approval authority agrees that private
open space for park and recreation purposes is to be provided in a proposed land division,
subdivision, or condominium development, following a recommendation from the Village Board’s
Parks Committee, and such space is to be privately owned and maintained as recreational space by the
future residents of the division or development, such areas shall be credited against the requirement of
public land dedication for park and recreation purposes or the payment of park land impact fees in
lieu thereof.
(b) Private Open Space Improvement. Where the appropriate Village approval authority agrees that
private open space can be used to satisfy all or part of the Village’s park land dedication
requirements, and the subdivider agrees to install improvements such as play equipment or athletic
facilities within the private open space, the value of such improvements may be credited toward the
requirement for recreation improvement impact fees.
(c) Standards for Credit for Private Open Space and Improvements Thereto. The appropriate
Village approval authority must find that the following standards are met before providing credits
under subsections (a) and (b).
(1) It is in the public interest to accept private open space instead of a public park and recreation site.
SUBDIVISION AND LAND DIVISION REGULATIONS 10/03/2019
Page 38 ARTICLE 9: PARKS AND RECREATION
(2) Yards, setbacks, and other open areas required to be maintained by zoning regulations shall not
be included in the computation of such private open space.
(3) The private ownership and maintenance of the open space must be adequately provided for by
written and recorded agreement.
(4) The use of the private open space must be restricted for park and recreational purposes by
recorded covenants that run in favor of the future owners of property within the tract and the
Village and that cannot be eliminated without the consent of the Village Board.
(5) The private open space shall be designed and improved for use for park and recreational
purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and
location of the private open space land.
Section 10-3-0906: Access to Waterways
(a) Statutory Requirement. A land division, subdivision, or condominium development abutting a
navigable waterway shall, in accordance with the provisions of Section 236.16(3), Wis. Stats.,
provide access at least 60 feet wide to the low water mark so that there will be public access,
connected to public roads, at ½ mile intervals as measured along the lake or stream shore, except
where greater intervals or different access is agreed upon by the state of Wisconsin, and excluding
shore areas where public parks or open space, streets, or roads on either side of a stream are provided.
(b) Other Access to Navigable Waterways. The Village may require a public access easement along all
navigable waterways. Where natural waterways traverse the land division, subdivision, or
condominium development containing sufficient waterway area to contain the design discharge and
where such natural waterways are endowed with significant natural beauty and have proven
themselves reasonably stable, the land divider, subdivider, or condominium developer shall leave
such channels in their natural state and shall dedicate, or provide public access easements along, such
waterways, together with a sufficient access, along the periphery of the swale as a separate parcel or
parcels, unless otherwise allowed by the Village. Such dedication shall not be credited against the
parkland dedication requirements specified in this Article.

Chapter. Exceptions or waivers may be granted only where findings are made based upon the
evidence presented in each specific case that all of the following criteria are met:
(1) The granting of the exception or waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or
welfare or injurious to other property.
(2) The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is
sought and are not applicable generally to other property, except as allowed through a planned
unit development or a traditional neighborhood development under the zoning ordinance.
(3) Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific
property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out, except as allowed through a
planned unit development or a traditional neighborhood development under the zoning ordinance.
(4) The relief sought will not in any manner vary the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, zoning
ordinance, official map, or other ordinances, except that those documents may be amended in the
manner prescribed by law.
(5) The purpose of the exception or waiver is not based exclusively on a financial consideration.
(b) Conditions. In approving exceptions or waivers, the appropriate Village approval authority may
require such conditions as will in its judgment secure substantially the criteria in subsection (a) and
the purpose of this Chapter.
Section 10-3-1203: Procedure
A request for an exception or waiver shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider before or when the
preliminary plat, final plat, certified survey map, or condominium plat is filed. The request shall state

handicapped or visually impaired persons to public buildings financed in part by federal
revenue sharing. This Section provides for a grievance procedure providing for prompt and
equitable resolution of complaints alleging any acting prohibited by the Office of Revenue
Sharing's (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55[d[2]) implementing Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), Section 504 states, in part, that
"no otherwise qualified handicapped individual . .. shall, solely by reason of his handicap,
be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to

(2) A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the
person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.
(3) A complaint should be filed within thirty (30) days after the complainant becomes aware of
the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring before this
grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.)
(4) An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a complaint. The
investigation will be conducted by an appropriate person designated by the Village
Administrator who should review the handicapped Requirements Handbook published by
the Federal Programs Advisory Service.
(5) A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of resolution, if
any, shall be issued by the designated person and a copy forwarded to the complainant no
later than thirty (30) days after its filing.
(6) The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the Village relating to
the complaints filed.
(c) APPEALS.
(1) The complainant may appeal the decision of the Section 504 coordinator where he
or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The appeal request shall be made within
seven (7) days to the Village Administrator.
(2) The grievance shall be heard by the Plan Commission within ten (10) working days
after the filing of an appeals request. The grievance shall be heard at the Village
Hall at a convenient time fixed by the Plan Commission. The Village

first class mail of any such grievance hearing.
10-6-2

his or her application and record a copy of its determination with the Village
Administrator.

complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies
such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S.
Department of the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to
the pursuit of other remedies. However, the Village believes that resolution of the
complaint will be more promptly achieved if the Village is able to provide a remedy before

interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the Village
complies with Section 504 and the ORS regulations.

SEC. 10-8-1 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) The Village Board finds that:
(1) Diminishing supplies of nonrenewable energy resources threaten the physical and
economic well being of the residents of this community who presently rely on such
resources to maintain their homes, industries, businesses and institutions;
(2) Solar energy systems hold great promise for the future energy needs of this
community because they use a renewable energy resource; because they require
less capital, land, water and other resources needed for central-station generation of
electricity; and because they do not pollute the community's water and air; and
(3) The successful use of solar energy systems for such purposes as supplying space
heating, water heating or the production of electricity is dependent upon sufficient
access to direct sunlight.
(b) This chapter is adopted under authority contained in sec. 66.032, Wis. Stats., for the
purpose of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community by:
(1) Promoting the use of solar energy systems;
(2) Protecting access to sunlight for solar energy systems; and
(3) Assuring that potentially conflicting interests of individual property owners are
accommodated to the greatest extent possible compatible with the overall goal of
this ordinance.

ARTICLE 2: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
SEC. 10-9-16 AUTHORITY
(2) Ordinance Title 10, Chapter 9, Article 2 is adopted by the Village of Prairie du Sac under
the authority granted by s. 61.354, Wis. Stats. This ordinance supersedes all provisions
of any ordinance previously enacted under 61.35, Wis. Stats., that relate to storm water
management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in s. 61.354 Wis. Stats., s.
61.35 Wis. Stats., applies to this ordinance and to any amendments to this ordinance.
(2) The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory
powers of the same governing body.
(3) The Village of Prairie du Sac hereby will administer and enforce the provisions of this
ordinance.
(5) The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent erosion and sediment
control requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or
approvals including those authorized under ss. 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
(b) Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm.
Code.
SEC. 10-9-17 FINDINGS OF FACT
The Village of Prairie du Sac finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant
impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and
diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled postconstruction
runoff can:
(1) Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing
streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and
increasing stream temperature.
(2) Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and
water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids,
nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
(3) Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant
loads.
(4) Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
(5) Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,
drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities.
(6) Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood
peaks and volumes.
(7) Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of
flooding.
SEC. 10-9-18 PURPOSE AND INTENT
(1) PURPOSE. The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish long-term, postconstruction
runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public
health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to:
(a) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION CONTROL & STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
JULY 3, 2014
Page 12
(b) Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil
erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and
aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses;
preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
(c) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and
receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the
scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that
endanger downstream property.
(2) INTENT. It is the intent of the Village of Prairie du Sac that this ordinance regulates postconstruction
stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This ordinance may be
applied on a site-by-site basis. The Village of Prairie du Sac recognizes, however, that
the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this
ordinance is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systemslevel
stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on
a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices,
practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one
site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with
the performance standards developed under s. 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional
stormwater management measures and have been approved by the Village of Prairie du
Sac, it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction
management measures acceptable for the community.

(b) REGULATION OF CONSTRUCTION, RECONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION
AND DEMOLITION.
(1) A Certificate of Appropriateness must be issued by the Commission
before any owner or person in charge of a historic structure, historic site
or structure within an historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish
all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any
improvement upon the designated property or properties or cause or
permit any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish
such property. The Building Inspector shall not issue a permit for any
such work until the Certificate has been granted by the Commission.
(2) Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be approved by
the Commission unless:
a. In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the
proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely
affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon
which said work is to be done;
b. In the case of construction of a new improvement upon an
historic site, or within an historic district, the exterior of such
improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the
external appearance of other neighboring improvements on that
site or within the district;
c. In the case of property located in an historic district, the
proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or
demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this
section and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic
preservation plan for the district;

significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the
public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people
of the Village of Prairie du Sac and the state of Wisconsin;

character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the
Certificate of Appropriateness. The Commission shall make this
decision within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the application.
(4) The issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness is an addition to any
other permits required, and shall not relieve the applicant from following
the procedures to obtain those permits. A building permit or other
Village permits shall be invalid if it is obtained without the Certificate of
Appropriateness required for the proposed work.
(5) Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
Certificate of Appropriateness provided the work:
a. involves repairs to existing features of an historic structure or
site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces
identical in appearance; and
10-11-4
b. does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site;
and
c. does not require the issuance of a building permit.
