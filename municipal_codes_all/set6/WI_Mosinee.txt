PREFACE 
    Democracy is a government of laws. Good democracy requires not only good laws, but laws which are readily available in written form to all who are subject to them, to the public officials and police officers who must administer them and to the judges and attorneys who must interpret and apply them. It is for this reason that the common council of the City of Mosinee has adopted this Code of Ordinances. This Code represents the contribution of the common council to the democratic and efficient administration of the government and affairs of the City of Mosinee. 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mosinee, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as amended, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of David Poucher, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Robert Harrison, Administrator, and Dean Dietrich, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Except as provided in this section, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under section 2-354(f)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b) ?Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c) ?A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 2-356. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied, in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.

(3) ?Each authority shall make available for inspection and copying under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1) any record produced or collected under a contract entered into by the authority with a person other than an authority to the same extent as if the record were maintained by the authority.

Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1) ?Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them.

Stats. § 19.31(1)(a), (am), and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that is not subject to such disclosure.

(6) ?Illuminated signs: No internally illuminated signs will be permitted on the exterior of buildings used for business purposes within the city's downtown central business district. Exterior signs shall be illuminated by means similar to that shown in "Design Recommendations for Mosinee's Downtown Business District." This includes neon signage and any signage that has its own light source. The idea of this section is to provide lighting that is consistent with the concept of Early Mosinee. Internally illuminated signs, such as neon signs are permitted inside of the building in windows for businesses which are open during any evening hours, but may not exceed three square feet per window. 
(7) ?Approval: The design (or drawing) for new signage in the central business district must be submitted to the Mosinee BID advisory committee for review for compliance with the sign code.

The owner/designee shall then submit a written building permit obtained from the city clerk's office. 
(8) ?Colors: The color of the signage should be compatible with exterior colors of the storefront. Color schemes should be kept simple. Day-glow paints or colors are not permitted. 
(9) ?Movable signs: Motorized or movable signs are not permitted within the BID district. 
(10) ?Location: Projecting signs should be located so they do not visually cancel each other out. Projecting signs should be located in a location so as not to interfere with the composition of the existing building facade. 
(11) ?Content: Signs shall bear thereon no lettering other than to indicate the name and kind of business conducted in the building or structure, such as "men's clothing," "drugs," "jeweler," and the like and the year the business was established and the street number thereof. No sign shall advertise any particular article of merchandise.

Subdivision III. - Conditional Uses 

Sec. 42-811. - Statement of purpose. 
    The development and execution of this subdivision is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use at a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location, development and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses. 
Sec. 42-812. - Authority of the plan commission and council; requirements.

The plan commission shall request such review and await the highway agency's recommendation for a period not to exceed 20 days before taking final action. 
(c) ?Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards or parking requirements, may be required by the common council upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this article. 
(d) ?Compliance with all other provisions of this article, such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking, loading, traffic, highway access and performance standards, shall be required of all conditional uses. 
(e) ?Any need for a zoning variance as part of a proposed conditional use that was, or under the circumstances reasonably should have been, anticipated by the applicant prior to the rendering of a recommendation by the plan commission on the proposed conditional use shall be prohibited as set forth in section 42-819(7), if not brought to the attention of the plan commission prior to the rendering of a recommendation by the plan commission on the proposed conditional use.

Sec. 42-814. - Application for conditional use. 
    An application for a conditional use shall be filed on a form prescribed by the city. The application shall be accompanied by a plan showing the location, size and shape of the lots involved and of any proposed structures, the existing and proposed use of each structure and lot, and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use shall conform to the standards set forth in section 42-817. The applicant is responsible for identifying all variances that may be needed related to the proposed use and shall list them in the application. The plan commission may require such other information as may be necessary to determine and provide for an enforcement of this article, including a plan showing contours and soil types; high-water mark and groundwater conditions; bedrock, vegetative cover, specifications for areas of proposed filling, grading and lagooning; location of buildings, parking areas, traffic access, driveways, walkways, open spaces and landscaping; and plans of buildings, sewage disposal facilities, water supply systems and arrangements of operations.

Sec. 42-821. - Complaints. 
    The common council shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of resolving complaints against all previously approved conditional uses. Such authority shall be in addition to the enforcement authority of the zoning administrator to order the removal or discontinuance of any unauthorized alterations of an approved conditional use, and the elimination, removal or discontinuance of any violation of a condition imposed prior to or after approval or violation of any other provision of this article. Upon written complaint by any citizen or official and after seeking an advisory recommendation from the plan commission, the council shall initially determine whether such complaint indicates a reasonable probability that the subject conditional use is in violation of either one or more of the standards set forth in section 42-817, a condition of approval or other requirement imposed under this subdivision. Upon reaching a positive initial determination, a hearing shall be held upon notice, as provided in section 42-816. Any person may appear at such hearing and testify in person or represented by an agent or attorney. The common council may, in order to bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set forth in section 42-817 or conditions previously imposed by the council, modify existing conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the subject conditional use. If no reasonable modification of such conditional use can be made in order to ensure that section 42-817(1) and (2) will be met, the common council may revoke the subject conditional approval and direct the zoning administrator and the city attorney to seek elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of the common council shall be furnished the current owner of the conditional use in writing stating the reasons therefor.

Sec. 42-1019. - Procedure for submitting subdivisions. 
(a) ?Subdivisions. 
(1) ?Preliminary meetings. Before filing a preliminary plat, or certified survey, the subdivider is encouraged to consult with the plan commission and/or its consulting staff for advice regarding general subdivision requirements. The preliminary plat should be drawn on a topographic survey map to be submitted to the plan commission. The subdivider shall also submit a location map showing the relationship to the plan commission of the proposed subdivision to traffic arteries and existing community facilities. 
(2) ?Preliminary plat. 
a. ?The subdivider shall submit to the common council and to those agencies having the authority to object to plats under provisions in Wis. Stats. ch. 236, a preliminary plat (or certified survey) based upon an accurate exterior boundary survey by a registered land surveyor which shall show clearly the proposed subdivision at a scale of not more than one inch per 100 feet having two-foot contour intervals, shall identify the improvements (grading, tree planting, paving, installation of facilities and dedications of land), easements which the subdivider proposes to make and shall indicate by accompanying letter when the improvements will be provided. Any proposed restrictive covenants for the land involved shall be submitted. 
b. ?The common council shall submit a copy of the preliminary plat to the plan commission, and, at its option to the zoning administrator for review and written report of their recommendations and reactions to the proposed plat. 
c. ?After review of the preliminary plat or survey map and negotiations with the subdivider on changes being advisable and the kind and extent of public improvements which will be required, the plan commission shall reject or approve conditionally the preliminary plat within 20 days, as provided by statute. 
d. ?If the plan commission rejects the plat or map, it shall return it to the owner. If it approves or conditionally approves the plat or map, it shall so notify the common council. 
e. ?If the plan commission approves the preliminary plat, the common council shall, within 40 days of the date the plat was filed with the administrator, approve conditionally or reject such plat and shall state, in writing, any conditions of approval or reasons for rejection, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. Failure of the common council to act within 40 days or extension thereof shall constitute an approval of the preliminary plat, unless other authorized agencies object to the plat. The administrator shall communicate to the subdivider the action of the common council. If the plat or map is approved, the administrator shall endorse it for the common council. 
f. ?Upon filing the preliminary plat or map with the city, the owner shall pay a fee as set by the council from time to time. 
g. ?Approval of the preliminary plat shall entitle the subdivider to final approval of the layout shown by such plat, provided the final plat conforms substantially to such layout and conditions of approval have been met. 
(3) ?Public improvements, plans and specifications. Simultaneously with the filing of the preliminary plat or map, the owner shall file with the administrator five complete sets of preliminary plans and specifications for the construction of any public improvements required by section 42-1045. 
(4) ?Property owners association. The plan commission may require submission of a draft of the legal instruments and rules for proposed property owners associations when the subdivider proposes that common property within a subdivision would be either owned or maintained by such an organization of property owners. 
(5) ?Affidavit. The surveyor preparing the preliminary plat shall certify on the face of the plat that it is a correct representation of all existing land divisions and features and that he has fully complied with the provisions of this article. 
(6) ?Final plat. 
a. ?Final plats shall be submitted to the city within six months of preliminary plat acceptance unless this requirement is waived in writing by the common council. 
b. ?The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved and to the requirements of all applicable ordinances and state laws and shall be submitted for certification of those agencies having the authority to object to the plat as provided by Wis. Stats. § 236.12(2). 
c. ?Simultaneously with the filing of the final plat or map, the owner shall file with the administrator four copies of the final plans and specifications of public improvements required by section 42-1045. 
d. ?The administrator shall forward the plat or map and plans and specifications of public improvements to the plan commission and forward copies of the plat to the director of local affairs and development, as provided by Wis. Stats. § 236.12(2). 
e. ?The plan commission shall refer the final plat or map and final plans and specifications of public improvements to the zoning administrator for review. 
f. ?The zoning administrator shall examine the plat or map and final plans and specifications of public improvements for technical details and, satisfactory, shall so certify in writing to the plan commission. 
g. ?If the plat or map or the plans and specifications are not satisfactory, the zoning administrator shall return them to the owner and so advise the plan commission. 
h. ?If the plat or map and plans and specifications of public improvements are satisfactory to the plan commission, it shall so notify the common council; if they are not satisfactory to the plan commission, they shall be rejected in writing and returned to the owner. If recommended by the plan commission, and if permitted by the common council, the final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the owner proposes to record at that time. 
i. ?The final plat shall be accepted or rejected by the common council within 60 days of its submission, unless the time is extended by an agreement with the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated in the minutes of the common council meeting and a copy thereof or a written statement of such reasons supplied to the subdivider. If the common council fails to act within 60 days and the time has not been extended by agreement and if no unsatisfied objections have been filed within that period, the plat shall be deemed to be approved. Following the approval of the plat as certified by all necessary officials, the plat shall be recorded in accordance with the requirements of statute. The plat shall be recorded prior to the time that lots are offered for sale, reference is made to the map for sales purposes, or use is made of lot and block numbers on the plat. 
j. ?If the original of the final plat has been filed with another approving authority, the subdivider may file a true copy of such plat in lieu of the original. However, before approval of the common council will be inscribed on the original of the final plat, the surveyor or subdivider shall certify the respects in which the original of the final plat differs from the true copy and all modifications must first be approved. 
(b) ?Minor subdivisions. 
(1) ?Certified survey required. When it is proposed to divide land into two parcels or building sites, any one of which is less than five acres, or when it is proposed to divide a block, lot or outlot into not more than four parcels or building sites within a recorded subdivision plat without changing the exterior boundaries of the block, lot or outlot, the subdivider shall subdivide by use of a certified survey map, prepared in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 236.34.

Sec. 42-1045. - Drainage system. 
(a) ?Required. A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and the drainage area of which it is a part. A final plat shall not be approved until the subdivider shall submit plans, profiles and specifications as specified in this section, which have been prepared by a registered professional engineer and approved by the zoning administrator. 
(b) ?Plans. 
(1) ?The subdivider shall submit to the zoning administrator and plan commission a report on the ability of existing watercourse channels, storm sewers, culverts and other improvements pertaining to drainage or flood control within the subdivision to handle the additional runoff which would be generated by the development of the land within the subdivision. Additional information shall be submitted to adequately indicate that provision has been made for disposal of surface water without any damage to the developed or undeveloped land downstream below the proposed subdivision. The report shall also include: 
a. ?Estimates of the quantity of stormwater entering the subdivision naturally from areas outside the subdivision. 
b. ?Quantities of flow at each inlet or culvert. 
c. ?Location, sizes and grades of required culverts, storm drainage sewers and other required appurtenances. 
(2) ?A grading plan for the streets, blocks and lots shall be submitted by the subdivider for the area within the subdivision. 
(3) ?The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be based upon information provided by the zoning administrator. 
(4) ?Materials and construction specifications for all drainage projects (i.e., pipe, culverts, seed, sod, etc.) shall be in compliance with specifications provided by the common council or zoning administrator. 
(c) ?Grading. The subdivider shall grade each subdivision in order to establish street, block and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to topography as follows: 
(1) ?The subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all proposed streets in accordance with the approved plans. 
(2) ?Block grading shall be completed by one or more of the following methods: 
a. ?A ridge may be constructed along the rear lot lines which provides for drainage onto the streets. 
b. ?Parts of all lots may be graded to provide for drainage to the street or to a ditch along the rear lot line. 
c. ?Draining across rear or side lot lines may be permitted, provided that drainage onto adjoining properties is skillfully controlled. 
(3) ?Lot grading shall be completed so that water drains away from each proposed building at a minimum grade of two percent and provisions shall be made to prevent excessive drainage onto adjacent properties. 
(4) ?The topsoil stripped by grading shall not be removed from the site and shall be uniformly spread over the lots when rough grading is finished. 
(d) ?System requirements. The subdivider shall install all the storm drainage facilities indicated on the plans required in subsection (a) of this section. 
(1) ?Street drainage. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system. The street storm system shall serve as the primary drainage system and shall be designed to carry street, adjacent land and building stormwater drainage. No stormwater shall be permitted to be run into the sanitary sewer system within the proposed subdivision. 
(2) ?Off-street drainage. The design of the off-street drainage system shall include the watershed affecting the subdivision and shall be extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage. When the drainage system is outside of the street right-of-way, the subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating an easement to the city to provide for the future maintenance of such system. Easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet, but the city may require larger easements if more area is needed due to topography, size of watercourse, etc. 
(e) ?Protection. The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches to the satisfaction of the common council and zoning administrator. Ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded or paved depending upon grades and soil types. (Generally ditches or channels with grades up to one percent shall be seeded; those with grades up to four percent shall be sodded and those with grades over four percent shall be paved.) 
Sec. 42-1046. - Extra-size or off-site improvements. 
(a) ?Design capacity. All improvements shall be installed to satisfy the service requirements for the service or drainage area in which the subdivision is located and the improvements shall be of sufficient capacity to handle the expected development of the overall service or drainage area involved. 
(b) ?Extra-size improvements. Where improvements in excess of the size needed to serve just the proposed subdivision are required, the subdivider shall pay for the total cost of improvements he is required to install to serve his subdivision. The additional costs which result from the extra-size improvement shall be paid for by the city. Thus, when conditions within the whole drainage area will require an 18-inch sanitary sewer, for example, and a 12-inch sewer will adequately serve the subdivision involved, the subdivider shall construct the 18-inch utility and bill the city for the difference in material costs between a 12-inch and 18-inch sewer pipe. 
(c) ?Off-site extensions. When streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of the proposed subdivision, the city, or its duly authorized representative, shall require, as a prerequisite to approval of a final plat, assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided as follows: 
(1) ?Extensions of utilities onto the property involved shall be adequate to serve the total development requirements of the service or drainage area. Utilities leaving the property shall be constructed in such a manner as to make their extension practical for servicing the adjacent areas of the service or drainage area. 
(2) ?If the city, or its duly authorized representative, find that extensions across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties or as a governmental expense until some future time, the developer shall be required, if he wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain necessary easements or rights-of-way and construct and pay for such extensions. Such improvements shall be available for connections by subdividers of adjoining land and the subdivider may contract with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements constructed. 
(d) ?Lift stations and force mains. Where sanitary sewer lift stations and force mains are required to lift sewage to the gravity system, the subdivider shall have plans, profiles and specifications prepared for the installation of such facilities. The installation, inspection supervision and engineering fees for lift stations and/or force mains shall be paid for by the subdivider unless otherwise determined and agreed upon by the common council. 
Sec. 42-1047. - Nonresidential subdivisions. 
(a) ?General.

(2) ?A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of site plan approval set forth in article II of this chapter. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the city, and shall conform to the proposed land use standards established in the comprehensive plan, official map and article II of this chapter. 
(b) ?Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in this division, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed:

Sec. 42-1049. - Easements. 
(a) ?Utility easements. The common council, on the recommendation of the plan commission and other appropriate agencies of the city, shall require utility easements for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and head mains or other utility lines. It is the interest of this article to protect all established easements so as to ensure proper grade, ensure maintenance of the established grade, prohibit construction of permanent fences or retaining walls over underground installations and prevent the planting of trees in easement areas. 
(b) ?Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream: 
(1) ?There shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this section; or 
(2) ?The watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream may be relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of adequate drainage will be assured and the same provided with a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the relocated watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to comply with this section. 
(3) ?Wherever possible, it is desirable that drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. In all cases, such watercourse shall be of a minimum width established at the high water mark, or in the absence of such specification, not less than 30 feet. 
(c) ?Easement locations. Such easements shall be at least 12 feet wide and may run across lots or alongside of rear lot lines. Such easements should preferably be located along rear lot lines. Evidence shall be furnished the plan commission that easements and any easement provisions to be incorporated in the plat or in deeds have been reviewed by the individual utility companies or the organization responsible for furnishing the services involved. 
Sec. 42-1050. - Public sites and open spaces. 
(a) ?Purpose. The requirements of this section are established to ensure that adequate parks, open spaces and sites for other public uses are properly located and preserved as the city grows. It has also been established to ensure that the costs of providing the park and recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional people brought into the community by land development may be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs created by the development. The requirements shall apply to all lands proposed for all residential development. 
(b) ?Design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, planned unit development or development project, provision shall be made for suitable sites of adequate area for schools, parks, playgrounds, open spaces, drainageways and other public purposes. Such sites as are shown on the official map, master plan or parks and open space plan, if applicable, shall be made a part of the design. Consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds and ravines and woodland, prairie and wetland plant and animal communities. 
(c) ?Dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate adequate developable land for the park, recreation and open space needs of the development, subject to a determination of acceptability by the plan commission. The subdivider shall dedicate sufficient land area that is suitable and readily developable to provide adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs to be created by and to be provided for the subdivision, land division, group housing project or planned community development project. These public lands shall be made a part of the plat and shall be dedicated to the public at the minimum rate of one acre for each 25 proposed dwelling units. 
(d) ?Fee in lieu of dedication. 
(1) ?Where, in the discretion of the plan commission, there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed subdivision or the dedication of land would not be compatible with the city's comprehensive development plan, or the plan commission determines that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the plan commission shall recommend to the common council that the subdivider pay a fee in lieu of making the required land dedication. Where the proposed subdivision consists of 15 or more lots, the plan commission may require either a land dedication or a fee in lieu of dedication. Where the proposed subdivision consists of less than 15 lots, a parcel assessment fee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be utilized. 
(2) ?Where a fee in lieu of land system is used, the subdivider shall pay to the city a fee equivalent to the fair market value of one acre for each 25 proposed dwelling units. The fair market of such a residential lot shall be determined by the city assessor. 
(3) ?If the amount of land required to be dedicated, other than for streets and drainageways as indicated on the master plan, comprehensive plan component or official map of the city totals less than the ratio of one acre for each 25 proposed dwelling units, the subdivider shall pay to the city a fee equivalent to the fair market value of the amount of land representing the difference between the amount of land required to be dedicated, other than the streets and drainageways, as indicated on such plans or maps and the rate of dedication established in this section. Such fees required in lieu of dedication shall be paid to the administrator at the time of first application for approval of a final plat of such subdivision. 
(4) ?All funds so collected by the city shall be deposited as "Special Fund for the Acquisition and Development of Public Sites, Recreation Areas, Open Spaces and Greenways" (park special fund), and that such funds so levied and collected shall be used for such purposes at such places and in such manner as shall be approved, ordered and directed by the city upon recommendation by the plan commission. Any and all interest accumulated upon such funds shall be added to the special fund and be used only for acquisition and developments for such purposes. 
(e) ?Assessment per unit fee. Where a subdivision consists of less than 15 lots, a one-time fee as set by the council from time to time per dwelling unit or lot, whichever is greater, will be assessed for park development. These fees are to be placed in the park special fund for park development. 
(f) ?Dedication and fee. The plan commission may recommend the subdivider satisfy the requirements by combining land dedication with fee payments. The fee, in such cases, shall be determined by subtracting the fair market value of the dedicated land, from the total fee which would have been imposed had no land been dedicated by the subdivider. The fair market value shall be determined by the city assessor. 
(g) ?Development of area. 
(1) ?When park land is dedicated, the subdivider is required to bring the dedicated land up to the contours established in the approved street and utility plans, topsoiled with a minimum of four inches of quality topsoil, seeded as specified by the common council, fertilized with 16-6-6 fertilizer at the rate of seven pounds per 1,000 square feet and mulched as specified in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, sections 627 and 629. The topsoil furnished for the park site shall consist of the natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam humus-bearing soils adapted to the sustenance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither excessively acid nor excessively alkaline. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one year following issuance of the first building permit within that subdivision unless otherwise authorized by the plan commission. 
(2) ?It shall be the duty of the city to maintain the dedicated areas, and the owner who dedicated the land shall in no way be responsible for its maintenance or liability thereon except that such owner shall not develop the surrounding area in a manner which would unduly depreciate the purpose, use or value of the dedicated property and except if such owner shall reside on one of the subdivided parcels, in which case he shall be responsible for the maintenance of adjacent public property as may be required in other laws of the city. 
(h) ?Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Fair market value (market value) means the highest price in terms of money which a property will bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. 
    Land use regulation means, broadly, any legal restriction, such as zoning ordinances which control the uses to which land may be put. A land use regulation may include such controls as those established by restrictive covenants or by redevelopment or urban renewal plans approved by local governing bodies. 
    Phase means a phase ends with the completion of public improvements (as shown in the final plat documents) and a new phase begins with the start of public improvements (as shown in the final plat documents) in the portion of the plat being developed. 
    Public improvements means installation of streets, electric service, sewer and water, gas lines and telephone lines. 
    Subdivider means any person, firm, partnership, corporation, association, estate or other legal entity using land for residential development. This shall include all residential development whether or not there is an actual subdivision of land. Property which does not require subdivision but will be used for residential development shall be included. 
Sec. 42-1051. - Variations and exceptions. 
(a) ?Where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may recommend to the common council variations or exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this article. 
(b) ?The plan commission shall not recommend variations or exceptions to the regulations of this article unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(1) ?The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; 
(2) ?The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property; and 
(3) ?Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out. 
(c) ?Any recommendations by the plan commission shall be so endorsed by the secretary and transmitted to the common council. The common council, if it approves, shall do so by motion or resolution and instruct the administrator to notify the plan commission and the owner.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 42-1086. - Statutory authorization. 
    This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 144.26. 
Sec. 42-1087. - Findings of fact. 
    Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the pollution of the navigable waters of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and impair the tax base. The state legislature has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. 
Sec. 42-1088. - Purpose of article. 
    To promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, this article has been established to: 
(1) ?Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; 
(2) ?Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters and to maintain stormwater and floodwater capacity; 
(3) ?Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat; 
(4) ?Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; 
(5) ?Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earthmoving activities; and 
(6) ?Maintain safe and healthful conditions, to prevent and control water pollution, to protect fish spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life and wildlife habitat, to preserve shore cover and natural beauty and to control building and development in wetlands whenever possible. When development is permitted in a wetland, the development should occur in a manner which minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland. 
Sec. 42-1089. - Compliance with article provisions. 
    The use of wetlands, and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the city shall be in full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. However, see section 42-1097 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this article. 
Sec. 42-1090. - Municipalities and state agencies regulated. 
    Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the state department of transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a) applies. 
Sec. 42-1091. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(a) ?This article supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this article, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b) ?This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
Sec. 42-1092. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the statute. Where a provision of this article is required by a standard in Wis. Adm. Code ch. NR 117, and where the article provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Adm. Code, ch. NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article. 
Sec. 42-1093. - Official shoreland-wetland zoning maps. 
    The following maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article and are on file in the office of the administrator: Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map(s), stamped "final" on November 25, 1987. 
Sec. 42-1094. - District boundaries. 
(a) ?The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the city which are five acres or more and are shown on the final wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this article in section 42-1093 and which are: 
(1) ?Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the city shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the department publication "Surface Water Resources of Marathon County" or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this article in section 42-1093. 
(2) ?Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this article in this section. Flood hazard boundary maps, flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary-floodway maps, county soil survey maps or other existing city floodplain zoning maps used to delineate floodplain area which have been adopted by the city, shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas in the city. 
(b) ?Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
(c) ?When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped, is in error. If the department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a shoreland-wetland map amendment within a reasonable period.

Stats. § 62.23(7)(d)2. The appropriate district office of the department shall be provided with written notice of the public hearing at least ten days prior to such hearing. 
(3) ?In order to ensure that the shoreland protection objectives in Wis. Stats. § 144.26, will be accomplished by the amendment, the common council may not rezone a wetland in a shoreland-wetland zoning district, or any portion thereof, where the proposed rezoning may result in a significant adverse impact upon any of the following: 
a. ?Stormwater and floodwater storage capacity; 
b. ?Maintenance of dry season stream flow or the discharge of groundwater to a wetland, the recharge of groundwater from a wetland to another area or the flow of groundwater through a wetland; 
c. ?Filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;

Sec. 42-1152. - Finding of fact. 
    The uncontrolled use of the floodplains, rivers or streams of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, and impairs its tax base. 
Sec. 42-1153. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide a uniform basis for the preparation, implementation and administration of sound floodplain regulations for all floodplains within the city to: 
(1) ?Protect life, health and property; 
(2) ?Minimize expenditures of public monies for costly flood control projects; 
(3) ?Minimize rescue and relief efforts, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4) ?Minimize business interruptions which usually result in the loss of local incomes; 
(5) ?Minimize damage to public facilities on the floodplains such as water mains, sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
(6) ?Minimize the occurrence of future floodblight areas on floodplains; and 
(7) ?Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers. 
(8) ?Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners. 
(9) ?Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 2010-01, §§ 1, 2, 7-12-2010) 
Sec. 42-1154. - Definitions. 
(a) ?Unless specifically defined in subsection (b) of this section, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have at common law and to give this article its most reasonable application. Words used in the present tense include the future. Words used in the singular number include the plural and words in the plural number include the singular. The word "may" is permissive. The word "shall" is mandatory and not discretionary. 
(b) ?The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    A zones means those areas shown on the city's "Official Floodplain Zoning Map" (see definition) which would be inundated by the base flood or regional flood. These areas may be numbered as A0, A1 to A30, A99, or be unnumbered A zones. The A zones may or may not be reflective of flood profiles, depending on the availability of data for a given area. 
    Accessory structure or use means a detached subordinate structure or a use which is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with the principal structure or use to which it is related, and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal structure or use. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as published by FEMA as part of a FIS and depicted on a FIRM. 
    Base flood elevation means an elevation equal to that which reflects the height of the base flood. 
    Basement means any enclosed area of a building having its floor sub-grade, i.e., below ground level, on all sides. 
    Board of appeals/adjustment means the body established under Wis. Stats. ch. 62.23, and designated "board of appeals." 
    Building. See Structure. 
    Bulkhead line means a geographic line along a reach of navigable water that has been adopted by a municipal ordinance and approved by the department pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 30.11, and which allows limited filling between this bulkhead line and the original ordinary highwater mark, except where such filling is prohibited by the floodway provisions of this article. 
    Campground means any parcel of land which is designed, maintained, intended or used for the purpose of providing sites for nonpermanent overnight use by four or more camping units, or which is advertised or represented as a camping area.

    Certificate of compliance means a certification that the construction and the use of land or a building, the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure is in compliance with all of the provisions of this article. 
    Channel means a natural or artificial watercourse with definite bed and banks to confine and conduct the normal flow of water. 
    Crawlways or crawl space means an enclosed area below the first usable floor of a building, generally less than five feet in height, used for access to plumbing and electrical utilities. 
    Deck means an unenclosed exterior structure that has no roof or sides, but has a permeable floor which allows the infiltration of precipitation. 
    Department means the state department of natural resources. 
    Development means any artificial change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or accessory structures; the construction of additions or alterations to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the repair of any damaged structure or the improvement or renovation of any structure, regardless of percentage of damage or improvement; the placement of buildings or structures; subdivision layout and site preparation; mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations; the storage, deposition or extraction of materials or equipment; and the installation, repair or removal of public or private sewage disposal systems or water supply facilities. 
    Dryland access means a vehicular access route which is above the regional flood elevation and which connects land located in the floodplain to land outside the floodplain, such as a road with its surface above regional flood elevation and wide enough for wheeled rescue and relief vehicles. 
    Encroachment means any fill, structure, building, accessory use, use or development in the floodway. 
    Equal degree of hydraulic encroachment means the effect of any encroachment into the floodway is computed by assuming an equal degree of hydraulic encroachment on the opposite side of a river or stream for a significant hydraulic reach. This computation ensures that property owners up, down or across the river or stream will have the same rights of hydraulic encroachment. (Also see Hydraulic reach and floodway lines. ) 
    Equal degree of hydrologic encroachment means the effect of any development on the storage capacity of a floodplain area, particularly upstream from urban areas, is analyzed assuming an equal loss of flood storage for all property owners and subdivided lots in the storage area of a floodplain on both sides of a river or stream for a significant hydrologic reach. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a parcel (or continuous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on which the manufactured home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and the construction of streets) is completed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
    Expansion to existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed. This includes installation of utilities, construction of streets and either final site grading, or the pouring if concrete pads. 
    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) means the federal agency that administers the National Flood Insurance Program. This agency was previously known as the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA). The Division of Insurance and Mitigation is contained within FEMA. (Should it be necessary to contact FEMA for information or assistance, the Region V Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Division of Insurance and Mitigation should be contacted.) 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas caused by one of the following conditions: 
    The overflow or rise of inland waters; 
    The rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or 
    The sudden increase caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a seiche, or by some similarly unusual event. 
    Flood frequency means the probability of a flood occurrence which is determined from statistical analyses. The frequency of a particular flood event is usually expressed as occurring, on the average once in a specified number of years or as a percent (%) chance of occurring in any given year. 
    Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway, which is covered by floodwaters during the regional flood; it is generally associated with standing water rather than rapidly flowing water. 
    Flood hazard boundary map means a map designating approximate flood hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are designated as unnumbered A zones and do not contain floodway lines or regional flood elevations. This map forms the basis for both the regulatory and insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until superseded by a flood insurance study and a flood insurance rate map. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means a map of a community on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both special flood hazard areas (the floodplain) and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. This map can only be amended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood insurance study means a technical engineering examination, evaluation and determination of city flood hazard areas. It provides maps designating those areas affected by the regional flood and provides both flood insurance rate zones and regional flood elevations as well as floodway lines. The flood hazard areas are designated as numbered A zones. Flood insurance study maps form the basis for both the regulatory and the insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Flood profile means a graph or a longitudinal profile showing the relationship of the water surface elevation of a flood event to locations along a stream or river. 
    Flood protection elevation means an elevation that corresponds to a point two feet of freeboard above the water surface profile associated with the regional flood. (Also see Freeboard. ) 
    Flood storage means those floodplain areas where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account during analysis in reducing the regional flood discharge. 
    Floodplain means the land which has been or may be hereafter covered by floodwaters during the regional flood. The floodplain includes the floodway and the flood fringe. 
    Floodplain island means a natural geologic land formation within the floodplain that is surrounded, but not covered, by floodwater during the regional flood. 
    Floodplain management means a policy and procedures to insure wise use of floodplains, including mapping and engineering, mitigation, education, and administration and enforcement of floodplain regulations. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to reduce or eliminate flood damage to unimproved or improved real estate, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional flood discharge. 
    Floodway encroachment lines means the limits of obstruction to flood flows. These lines are designated on both sides of, and generally parallel to, the channel of a river or stream. They are established by assuming that the area landward (outside of the encroachment lines) will ultimately be developed in such a way that it will not convey flood flows, but the development will not cause an increase to regional flood elevations upstream. It is assumed that any development riverward of these lines will cause an obstruction and will require a detailed analysis (equal degree of hydraulic encroachment) to determine its effect on the regional flood elevations upstream. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in terms of a certain amount of feet above a calculated flood level. Freeboard compensates for the many unknown factors that contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated. These unknown factors include, but are not limited to, ice jams, debris accumulation, wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and floodways, the effects of urbanization on the hydrology of the watershed, loss of flood storage areas due to development and the sedimentation of a river or stream bed. 
    Habitable structure means any structure or portion thereof used or designed for human habitation. 
    Hearing notice means a publication or posting meeting the requirements of Wis. Stats. ch. 985. For appeals, a Class 1 notice, published once at least one week (seven days) before the hearing, is required. For all zoning ordinances and amendments, a Class 2 notice, published twice, once each week consecutively, the last at least a week (seven days) before the hearing. Local ordinances or bylaws may require additional notice, exceeding these minimums. 
    High flood damage potential means any danger to human life or public health or the potential for any significant economic loss to a structure or its contents. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is either: 
 Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
 Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
 Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
 Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Hydraulic reach means that portion of the river or stream extending from one significant change in the hydraulic character of the river or stream to the next significant change. These changes are usually associated with breaks in the slope of the water surface profile, and may be caused by bridges, dams, expansions and contraction of the water flow, and changes in stream bed slope or vegetation. 
    Hydrologic reach means a designated length of river, stream or lake where the storage of floodwaters therein has been taken into account to reduce the regulatory flood discharge. Major manmade or natural changes in the river character, limits of political jurisdiction, or a change in the flood-routing technique used to determine the storage and translation of a flood wave through the area of interest may be used to define the end of a hydrologic reach (e.g., a dam may be considered a major manmade change in the river character or a change from channel routing to reservoir routing may be considered a major change in the flood-routing technique). 
    Increase in regional flood height means a calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation, equal to or greater than 0.01 foot, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge. 
    Land use means any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. (Also see Development. ) 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For the purpose of this article it does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. 
    Mobile recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled, carried or permanently towable by a licensed, light-duty vehicle, is licensed for highway use if registration is required and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall within the definition of "mobile recreational vehicles." 
    Municipality or municipal means the City of Mosinee which is enacting, administering and enforcing this article. 
    NAVD or North American Vertical Datum means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1988 adjustment. 
    New construction means for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    NGVD or National Geodetic Vertical Datum means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment. 
    Nonconforming structure means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this article for the area of floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the flood fringe district is a conforming use. However, if the first floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
    Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use of a structure, building or accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this article for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. 
    Obstruction to flow means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height. 
    Official floodplain zoning map means that map, adopted and made part of this article, which has been approved by the state department of natural resources and FEMA. 
    Open space use means those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures. 
    Ordinary highwater mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic. 
    Person means an individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or state agency. 
    Private sewage system means a sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by the department of commerce, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the structure. 
    Public utilities means those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer. 
    Reasonably safe from flooding means base flood waters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the special flood hazard area and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
    Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Storage capacity of a floodplain means the volume of space above an area of floodplain land that can be occupied by floodwaters of a given stage at a given time, regardless of whether the water is moving. 
    Structure means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, which includes, but is not limited to, such objects as roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts. 
    Subdivision has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. § 236.02(12). 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the present equalized assessed value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1) ?Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
(2) ?Any alteration of a structure or site documented as deserving preservation by the state historical society or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered structural repairs, modifications or additions; such ordinary maintenance repairs include internal and external painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows, and other nonstructural components. 
    Unnecessary hardship means any unique and extreme inability to conform to the provisions of this article due to special conditions affecting a particular property which were not self-created and are not solely related to economic gain or loss. Unnecessary hardship is present only where, in the absence of a variance, no feasible use can be made of the property. 
    Utilities means any public or private water supply, waste collection or disposal system including, but not limited to, private and public wells and their attendant facilities, septic systems and public sewage collection systems. 
    Variance means an authorization by the board of appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watershed means the entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
    Water surface profile means a graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas. 
    Well means an excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use.

Sec. 42-1155. - Areas to be regulated. 
    Areas regulated by this article include all lands, within the corporate limits of the city, that would be inundated by the "regional flood" defined in section 42-1154. 
Sec. 42-1156. - District boundaries. 
(a) ?Official maps. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Mosinee Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the flood insurance study (FIS) or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Clerk of the City of Mosinee. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers: 55073C0629F, 55073C0633F, 55073C0636F, 55073C0637F, 55073C0639F, 55073C0641F, 55073C0642F and 55073C0645F, all dated July 22, 2010; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) 55073CV000B dated September 28, 2018, Volume number 55073CV000B. 
    Approved by: The DNR and FEMA 
(b) ?Districts. The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this article are divided into three districts: the floodway district (FW), flood fringe district (FF), and general floodplain district (GFP), defined as follows: 
(1) ?The floodway district (FW) consists of the channel of a stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel that are required to carry and discharge the floodwaters or flood flows of any river or stream associated with the regional flood. 
(2) ?The flood fringe district (FF) consists of that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway area. 
(3) ?The general floodplain district (GFP) consists of land which has been or may be hereafter covered by floodwaters during the regional flood and encompasses both the floodway and flood fringe districts. 
(Ord. No. 2010-01, § 5, 7-12-2010; Ord. No. 2018-05, § 1, 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 42-1157. - Locating floodplain boundaries. 
(a) ?Where an apparent discrepancy exists between the location of the outermost boundary of the flood fringe district or general floodplain district shown on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions, the location of the district boundary line shall be initially determined by the zoning administrator using the criteria set forth in subsections (b) or (c) of this section. Where the zoning administrator finds that there is a significant difference between the district boundary shown on the map and the actual field conditions, the map shall be amended using the procedures established in division 2 of this article. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant on the location of the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 42-1183. 
(b) ?Where flood profiles exist, the location of the district boundary line shall be determined by the zoning administrator using both the scale appearing on the map and the elevations shown on the water surface profile of the regional flood. Where a discrepancy exists between the boundary line location shown on the map and the location indicated by the regional flood elevations and actual field conditions, the regional flood elevations shall govern. A map amendment is required where there is a significant discrepancy between the boundary line shown on the map and the location indicated by the regional flood elevations. The zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use permit on the basis of a district boundary derived from the elevations shown on the water surface profile of the regional flood, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating any map amendments required under this section within a reasonable period of time. 
(c) ?Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the district boundary line shall be determined by the zoning administrator using the scale appearing on the map, visual onsite inspection and any available information provided by the department. Where there is a significant difference between the district boundary line shown on the map and actual field conditions, the map shall be amended. Where a map amendment has been approved by both the common council and the department, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to grant or deny a land use permit. 
Sec. 42-1158. - Removal of lands from floodplain. 
    Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be grounds for removing lands from the floodplain district, unless they are removed by filling to a height of at least two feet above the regional flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land lying outside the floodplain district, and the map is amended pursuant to division 2 of this article. To remove the land from flood insurance requirements, FEMA must first revise the flood insurance rate map. 
Sec. 42-1159. - Compliance with article. 
    The use or development of any land or water, a change in the use of any land or water, and the use, change of use, construction, reconstruction, remodeling or expansion of any structure within the areas to be regulated by this article shall be in compliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable local, state and federal regulations. 
Sec. 42-1160. - Abrogation and greater restrictions; interpretation of chapter. 
(a) ?Greater restrictions. This article supersedes provisions of any zoning ordinance relating to floodplains. However, any underlying zoning shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions are more restrictive. 
(b) ?Abrogation. It is not otherwise intended by this article to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions; however, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
(c) ?Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by statute. Where a provision of this article is required by a standard in Wis. Adm. Code ch. NR 116, and where the meaning of the article provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Adm. Code ch.

Sec. 42-1161. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside of the delineated floodplain or permitted land uses within the floodplain will be totally free from flooding and associated flood damages, nor shall this article create a liability on the part of or a cause of action against, the city or any officer or employe thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
Sec. 42-1162. - General development standards. 
    The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this article.

Lawn areas, where provided, shall not be allowed to deteriorate to such condition as to be a seriously blighting influence on the surrounding property or neighborhood, or the city in general. The growth of grass or weeds in excess of six inches in height or the maintenance of the property with a lack of vegetation which renders the yard areas unsightly and results in the diminution of the appearance of the property as compared with adjacent properties shall be considered a violation of the maintenance provision of this section. Where lawn areas are not provided or have been removed, such areas shall be landscaped with garden beds or other ground cover so as not to be a public nuisance or a serious blighting influence.

On those streets in which curbs do not exist, the areas which shall be maintained as provided for in this subsection shall be the unpaved public area between the lot line and the shoulder of the roadway.

(b) ?Intentional concealment. The intentional concealment of unpurchased merchandise which continues from one floor to another or beyond the last station for receiving payments in a merchant's store is evidence of intent to deprive the merchant permanently of possession of such merchandise without paying the purchase price thereof. The discovery of unpurchased merchandise concealed upon the person or among the belongings of another is evidence of intentional concealment on the part of the person so concealing such goods. 
(c) ?Detainment of suspects.

The detained person must be promptly informed of the purpose for the detention and may make phone calls, but shall not be interrogated or searched against their will before the arrival of a police officer who may conduct a lawful interrogation of the accused person. Compliance with this subsection entitles the merchant or his employe affecting the detention to the same defense in any action as is available to a peace officer making an arrest in the line of duty.

Sec. 68-504. - Purpose and intent. 
(a) ?Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term, post- construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1) ?Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2) ?Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
(3) ?Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(b) ?Intent. It is the intent of the common council that this article regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The common council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16, for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council, it is the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

Gravel shall be of good quality. Concrete shall be mixed thoroughly for a minimum of one minute after all materials have been placed in the mixer. 
(3) ?Forms. Concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood or metal of sufficient strength to resist springing, tipping or other displacement during the process of depositing and consolidating the concrete. Wood forms shall be surfaced plank of at least two inches thickness except for sharply curved sections. Metal forms shall be of approved section. The forms shall be of full depth of the required walk and shall be of such design as to permit secure fastening. Forms shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled before the concrete is placed against them. Concrete shall be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade, deposited just above the finished grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar to the surface and to prevent honeycombing. It shall then be struck off level with the top of the forms and finished with wooden flats. To provide adequate drainage, the sidewalk shall slope toward the curb at a minimum rate of one-fourth inch per foot of width of sidewalk. All joints and edges shall be finished with a one-fourth-inch radius edging tool. Sidewalks shall be constructed within the limits of the street, and unless otherwise specifically indicated, there shall be one foot strip of street property left between the property line and the edge of the sidewalk. 
(4) ?Width and thickness. Residential walks shall be five feet in width and not less than four inches thick except within driveway approaches where the minimum thickness shall be six inches; provided, however, that walks in residential areas may be repaired or replaced to a width not less than the existing width on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Sidewalks in front of commercial or industrial establishments shall be not less than eight feet in width and five inches in thickness except within driveway approaches where the minimum thickness shall be seven inches. 
(5) ?Finishing. Before the last finish has set, the sidewalk shall be steel troweled and brushed in the transverse direction. Before the final finishing, the surface shall be checked with a ten-foot straight edge and any areas departing more than one-eighth of an inch from the testing edge shall be corrected by adding or removing concrete while the concrete in the walk is still plastic. 
(6) ?Jointing. Transverse, full depth, one-half inch thick expansion joints of premolded expansion material shall be located every 40 feet and at the property line, and where the walk intersects another walk, curbline, building or driveway approach, and at buildings, walls, poles and stop boxes. The expansion joint material shall be placed in a neat and workmanlike manner with its upper edge slightly below the finished sidewalk surface. Dummy groove joints for controlled cracking, at least three-eighths of an inch in thickness and 5/16 of an inch in depth, shall be placed at intervals of approximately four feet. All joints shall be at right angles to the direction and grade of the walk. Diagonal joints may be used only when approved by the public works director. 
(7) ?Curing and drying. As soon as any of the concrete work mentioned in this section has been finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent excessive marring of the surface, it shall be cured and protected against rapid drying. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be deemed sufficient cause for suspension of the work. Curing shall be accomplished by the impervious coating, wet fabric or paper methods. For impervious coating or membrane curing, only those materials meeting requirements of ASTM Specifications C156-44T, "Method of Test for Efficiency of Materials for Curing Concrete" shall be used. Such specifications are adopted by reference in this section as if fully set forth in this section. Walks shall be kept free from all traffic at normal temperatures for 48 hours and in cold weather (below 50 degrees Fahrenheit) for 96 hours. No concrete shall be poured when the temperature may be expected to fall below 35 degrees Fahrenheit in any 72-hour period or upon frozen subgrade. 
(d) ?Sidewalk repair or replacement. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.615, the common council may order property owners to repair or remove and replace any sidewalk which is unsafe, defective or insufficient. If the property owner shall fail to so repair or remove and replace such sidewalk for a period of 20 days after service of the notice provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.615(3)(c), the common council shall repair or construct such sidewalk, and the administrator shall enter the total cost thereof upon the tax roll as a special tax against such lot or parcel of land. 
(e) ?Unsafe sidewalks. The common council may at any time, by ordinance or resolution, order any sidewalk which is unsafe, defective or insufficient, to be removed and replaced with a sidewalk in accordance with the standard specifications provided for in this section. 
(f) ?Construction and repair of concrete curb and gutter. The provisions of Wis. Stats. § 66.60, shall be followed in the case of the construction and repair of concrete curb and gutter provided that the property deemed benefited by such construction and repair shall pay 100 percent of the costs thereof.

(1) ?Before a permit for excavating or opening any street or public way may be issued, the applicant shall execute and deposit with the administrator an indemnity bond in the amount set by the council from time to time on condition that he will indemnify and save harmless the city and its officers from all liability for accidents and damage caused by any of the work covered by his permit, and that he will fill up and place in good and safe condition all excavations and openings made in the street, and will replace and restore the pavement over any opening he may make as near as can be to the state and condition in which he found it, and keep and maintain the same in such condition, normal wear and tear excepted, to the satisfaction of the common council for a period of two years, and that he will pay all fines imposed upon him for any violation of any rule, regulation or ordinance governing street openings or drainlaying adopted by the common council and will repair any damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the excavation in accordance with the ordinances, rules and regulations of the city. Such statement shall also guarantee that if the city shall elect to make the street repair, the person opening the street will pay all costs of making such repair and of maintaining the street for two years. 
(2) ?Recovery on such bond for any accident, injury, violation of law, ordinance, rule or regulation shall not exhaust the bond but the party shall be obligated to replenish the bond up to the applicable limits and it shall cover any and all accidents, injuries or violations during the period of excavation for which it is given.

(b) ?Removal of paving. In any opening or excavation all paving or ballasting materials shall be removed with the least possible loss of or injury to surfacing materials and together with the excavated materials from the opening shall be placed so as to cause the least practicable inconvenience to the public and permit free flow of water along gutters. 
(c) ?Protection of public. 
(1) ?Every opening and excavation shall be enclosed with sufficient barriers. Sufficient warning lights shall be kept on from sunset to sunrise. Such lights shall be spaced so as to give adequate warning of the existence of the opening and of piled excavated materials. No open flame warning pots shall be used. Except by special permission from the public works director, no trench shall be excavated more than 250 feet in advance of pipe or conduit laying nor left unfilled more than 500 feet where pipe or conduit has been laid. 
(2) ?All necessary precautions shall be taken to guard the public effectively from accidents or damage to persons or property through the period of the work. Each person making such opening shall be held liable for all damages, including costs incurred by the city in defending any action brought against it for damages, as well as cost of any appeal, that may result from the neglect by such person or his employes of any necessary precaution against injury or damage to persons, vehicles or property of any kind. 
(d) ?Replacing street surface. In opening any public street, public alley, public sidewalk, public way, public easement or public ground, the paving materials, sand, gravel and earth or other material moved or penetrated and all surface monuments or hubs must be removed and replaced as nearly as possible in their original condition or position in the same relation to the remainder as before. Any excavated material which in the opinion of the public works director is not suitable for refilling shall be replaced with approved backfill material. All rubbish shall be immediately removed. In refilling the opening, the earth must be puddled or laid in layers not more than six inches in depth and each layer rammed, tamped or flushed to prevent after-settling. When the sides of the trench will not stand perpendicular, sheathing and braces must be used to prevent caving. No timber, bracing, lagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any trench. The city may elect to have the opening for any street or sidewalk repaired by the city, in which case the cost of making such repair and of maintaining it for two years shall be charged to the person making the street opening. 
(e) ?Notice. It shall be the duty of the permittee to notify the public works director or administrator and all public and private individuals, firms and corporations affected by the work to be done at least 24 hours before such work is to commence. The public works director shall also be notified at least four hours prior to backfilling and/or restoring the surface. 
(f) ?Validity of permit. Unless the work shall be commenced within 30 days of the issuance of the permit, the permit shall be void, and a new permit must be obtained and an additional fee charged. The public works director may extend the time limitation for good cause. 
(g) ?Backfilling. It shall be the duty of the permittee to backfill the opening immediately upon completion of the work and to place at least five inches of traffic bind or similar material in the opening unless otherwise advised by the public works director. It shall be the duty of the permittee to maintain the opening in good condition for a period of six months after the completion of the work or until the surface has been restored. The public works director shall decide when within the six months' period the opening is ready for paving if a paving surface is required.

(i) ?Excavation in new streets. Whenever the common council determines to provide for the permanent improvement or repaving of any street, such determination shall be made not less than 30 days before the work of improvement or repaving shall begin. Immediately after such determination by the common council, the administrator shall notify in writing each person, utility, city department or other agency owning or controlling any sewer, water main, conduit or other utility in or under said street or any real property abutting such street, that all such excavation work in such street must be completed within 30 days. After such permanent improvement or repaving, no permit shall be issued to open or excavate such street for a period of five years after the date of improvement or repaving unless in the opinion of the common council an emergency exists which makes it absolutely essential that the permit be issued. 
(j) ?Application for permit. The application for a permit shall be in writing and signed by the applicant or his agent. The applicant shall submit to the administrator, at the time the permit is applied for, sufficient information relating to the work to be done including the general location and nature of the work and the method applicant proposes to use in doing the work.

The water department should be consulted as to the type and size of meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or other suitable place within the building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a union, and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the water department (which may require a horizontal run of 18 inches in such pipe line) which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. 
(b) ?No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service.

Sec. 82-77. - Complaint tests. 
    If a customer requests, the utility shall promptly make an accuracy test in addition to the periodic or installation test if 24 months or more has elapsed since the last complaint test of the same meter in the same location. If less than 24 months has expired, there will be a charge set by the council from time to time per inch of nominal size or fraction thereof, payable in advance.

(Code 1986, § 5-2-36) 
Sec. 82-80. - Failure to read. 
(a) ?Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained from the customer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered. 
(b) ?If the meter is damaged (see section 82-105) or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method.

(Code 1986, § 5-2-41(a)) 
Sec. 82-102. - Disconnection for delinquent accounts. 
(a) ?A bill for service is delinquent if unpaid after the due date shown on the bill. The utility may disconnect service for a delinquent bill by giving the customer, at least eight calendar days prior to disconnection, a written disconnect notice which may be included with the bill for service. For purposes of this section, the due date shall not be less than 20 days after issuance. 
(b) ?The utility may disconnect without notice where a dangerous condition exists for as long as the condition exists. Service may be denied to any customer for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of the rules and regulations of the public service commission or of this division, or if a dangerous or unsafe condition exists on the customer's premises. 
(c) ?The utility shall notify the county department of health and social services at least five calendar days prior to any scheduled disconnection of residential service if the customer or responsible person has made a written request for this procedure. The utility shall apprise customers of this right upon application for service. If service to a residential customer which has been disconnected has not been restored within 24 hours after disconnection, the utility shall notify the appropriate county sheriff's department of the billing name and service address and that a threat to health and life might exist to persons occupying the premises. 
(Code 1986, § 5-2-41(b)) 
Sec. 82-103. - Deferred payment agreement. 
(a) ?The utility shall offer deferred payment agreements to residential customers. The deferred payment agreement shall provide that service will not be discontinued for the outstanding bill if the customer pays a stated reasonable amount of the outstanding bill and agrees to pay a stated reasonable portion of the remaining outstanding balance in installments until the bill is paid. In determining what amounts are reasonable, the parties shall consider the: 
(1) ?Size of the delinquent account; 
(2) ?Customer's ability to pay; 
(3) ?Customer's payment history; 
(4) ?Time that the debt has been outstanding; 
(5) ?Reasons why the debt has been outstanding; and 
(6) ?Any other relevant factors concerning the circumstances of the customer. 
(b) ?In the deferred payment agreement it shall state immediately preceding the space provided for the customer's signature and in boldface print at least two sizes larger than any other used thereon, the following: 
"IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT SIGN. IF YOU DO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE AMOUNT DUE UNDER THE AGREEMENT EXCEPT FOR THE UTILITY'S FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT." 
(c) ?A deferred payment agreement shall not include a finance charge. 
(d) ?If an applicant for service has not fulfilled the terms of a deferred payment agreement, the utility shall have the right to disconnect service or refuse service in accordance with these rules and under such circumstances, it shall not be required to offer subsequent negotiation of a deferred payment agreement prior to disconnection. 
(e) ?Any payments made by the customer in compliance with a deferred payment agreement, or otherwise, shall be first considered made in payment of the previous account balance with any remainder credited to the current bill. 
(Code 1986, § 5-2-41(c)) 
Sec. 82-104. - Dispute procedures. 
(a) ?Attempt to resolve; opportunity to enter deferred payment agreement. Whenever the customer advises the utility's designated office prior to the disconnection of service that all or part of any billing as rendered is in dispute, or that any matter related to the disconnection is in dispute, the company shall investigate the dispute promptly and completely, advise the customer of the results of the investigation, attempt to resolve the dispute, and provide the opportunity for the customer to enter into a deferred payment agreement, when applicable, in order to settle the dispute. 
(b) ?Informal review. After the customer has pursued the available remedies with the utility, he may request that the public service commission's staff informally review the disputed issue and recommend terms of settlement. 
(c) ?Formal review; payment of bill or posting of bond. Any party to the dispute after informal review may make a written request for a formal review by the public service commission. If the public service commission decides to conduct a formal hearing on the dispute, the customer must pay 50 percent of the bill in dispute or post a bond for that amount on or before the hearing date. Failure to pay the amount or post the bond will constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Service shall not be disconnected because of any disputed matter while the disputed matter is being pursued under the disputes procedure. In no way does this relieve the customer from the obligation of paying charges which are not disputed. 
(d) ?Form of disconnection notice. The form of disconnection notice to be used is as follows: 
DISCONNECTION NOTICE 
Dear Customer: 
The bill enclosed with this notice includes your current charge for utility service and your previous unpaid balance.

To avoid the inconvenience of service interruption and an additional charge of (amount) reconnection, we urge you to pay the full arrears IMMEDIATELY AT ONE OF OUR OFFICES. 
If you have entered into a deferred payment agreement with us and have failed to make the time payment you agreed to, your service will be subject to disconnection unless you pay the amount due within eight days. 
If you have a reason for delaying the payment, call us and explain the situation. 
PLEASE CALL THIS TELEPHONE NUMBER, (appropriate telephone number), IMMEDIATELY IF: 
1. ?You have a question about your utility service arrears.

Illness provision. 
If there is an existing medical emergency in your home and you furnish the utility with a statement signed by either a licensed Wisconsin physician, or a public health official, we will delay disconnection of service up to 21 days. The statement must identify the medical emergency and specify the period of time during which disconnection will aggravate the existing emergency. 
Deferred payment agreements. 
If, for some reason, you are unable to pay the full amount of the utility service arrears on your bill, you may contact the utility to discuss arrangements to pay the arrears over an extended period of time. 
This time payment agreement will require: 
1. ?Payment of a reasonable amount at the time the agreement is made. 
2. ?Payment of the remainder of the outstanding balance in monthly installments over a reasonable length of time. 
3. ?Payment of all future utility service bills in full by the due date.

Sec. 86-87. - AbatementGenerally. 
(a) ?Dutch Elm and other tree diseases a public nuisance. Whereas the common council has determined that there are many trees growing on public and private premises within the city, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of public and private premises and erode the tax base of the city, and that the health and life of such trees is threatened by fatal diseases such as Dutch Elm disease, which is spread by the elm bark beetles Scolytus multistriatus (Eichb.) or Hylurgopinus rufipes (Marsh.), the council hereby declares its intention to control and prevent the spread of such disease and the insect pests and vectors which carry such diseases and specifically declares Dutch Elm disease and the elm bark beetles which carry such disease to be public nuisances.

(3) ?When the forester shall determine with reasonable certainty that a public nuisance exists upon private premises, he shall immediately serve or cause to be served personally or by registered mail upon the owner of such property, if he can be found, or upon the occupant thereof, a written notice of the existence of such nuisance and of a time and place for a hearing, not less than 14 days after service of such notice, on the abatement action to be taken. Such notice shall describe the nuisance and recommend procedures for its abatement, and shall further state that unless the owner shall abate the nuisance in the manner specified in the notice, or shall appear at the hearing to show that such nuisance does not exist or does not endanger the health of trees in the city, the forester shall cause the abatement thereof at the expense of the property served.

(2) ?In order to facilitate the work and minimize the inconvenience to the public of any spraying operations conducted under this section, the forester shall cause to be given advance public notice of such operations by newspaper, radio, television, public service announcements or other effective means and shall also cause the posting of appropriate warning notices in the areas and along the streets where trees are to be sprayed at least 24 hours in advance of spraying. When any residue or concentrate from municipal spraying operations can be expected to be deposited on any public street, the forester shall also notify the chief of police, who shall take all necessary steps to make and enforce temporary parking and traffic regulations on such streets as conditions require.

(4) ?In accordance with section 86-88, oak wilt trees or parts thereof not removed on or before April 1 by the property owner shall be removed by the city within 20 days after notification and the cost thereof assessed against the property. 
(5) ?If the city forester finds that oak wilt threatens to cross property boundaries, the forester may require root graft disruption to prevent the spread of disease in this manner. In accordance with section 86-88, the charge or any portion thereof, for any necessary root graft barriers may be assessed against the property on which the root barriers are placed.
