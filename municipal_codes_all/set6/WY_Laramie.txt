PREFACE 
    The Laramie, Wyoming Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1982, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Thomas S. Smith, city attorney. 
    This 2011 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ordinance No. 1819, adopted Dec. 21, 2010, and was accomplished under the supervision of Eric Grant, Supplement Department Vice President, and Katrina Hansen, Editor. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. Legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    This republication brings the code up to date through Ordinance No. 1758 , passed on December 18, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title, chapter and divisions, with specific page locations. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters, divisions and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    This table is no longer updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    This table has been replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    A Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbering System. 
    The page numbering system used in this code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. When new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
  
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

Purpose. The city by enactment of this section, states that it is the public policy of the city to balance the interest of its citizens and visitors to the city against the interest of the liquor license holders in operating and maintaining their business activities upon licensed establishment premises. If the license holder fails to adhere to certain minimum standards, or fails to abide by this section or applicable law of the state, the liquor establishment license holder shall be subject to the provisions herein. To provide for an orderly administration of this section, and the maintenance of existing licenses, the city establishes a point system for suspension and revocation of alcoholic beverage liquor licenses. The scheme of points is listed according to the type of alcoholic beverage violation, and the accumulation of points may lead to a suspension, revocation, non-renewal and/or fine of a liquor licensee who repeatedly violates the city code and state law as set forth herein. 
B.  Violations. Violations of this chapter by an employee or agent of a licensee, while acting in the service of the licensee, shall be imputed to the licensee for the purposes of this section. Accordingly, a licensee will acquire points upon the conviction of his or her employees and/or agents for violations of this chapter committed while acting in the service of the licensee. References to "violations by a licensee," "convictions of a licensee," "points acquired by a licensee," and similar references shall be construed in a manner consistent with this intent. Upon conviction for any offense specified in subsection C. of this section, the number of points specified in subsection C. of this section shall be acquired by the licensee. Points shall be considered "acquired" by a licensee on the date this violation is assessed against a licensee. In attributing points to a licensee, the section number of the city code which the licensee is convicted of violating and the points ascribed to the violation by subsection C. of this section or by the hearing examiner are controlling. 
C.  Point Schedule. The number of points specified below will be acquired by a licensee as a result of a conviction of the licensee, the licensee's employees or agents acting in the service of licensee for violations of the corresponding sections of this chapter of the city code. 
    Accrual of Points for Timely Reporting of False Identification Presentation. Any licensee whose has an employee report to the police at the time of occurrence when a patron presents a false or suspected false identification card shall be credited with five points. These points may be used to offset any assignment of points for violations noted under [subsection] C. of this section. Additionally, and in cooperation with local advocacy entities and the police department, if funds exist, the licensee may be credited up to one and one-half times the amount if the licensee can provide documentation of the existence of a reward program for the identification and confiscation and timely reporting to the police department of any false identifications used by patrons of the licensee. It shall be the responsibility of the police department to effectively establish such a program and to justify, in the case a program cannot be established, why this is so. 
    All licensees can gain a credit of five points per meeting by attending quarterly tavern owners group meetings that will be arranged by the police department. 
D.  Notification of Licensee of Alcoholic Beverage Violation. 
1.  Municipal Court. Not later than thirty days following disposition of a charge which results in a conviction for an alcoholic beverage violation noted herein in municipal court, the court shall report the following information to the city clerk:

b.  Summarizing the nature and date(s) of the incidents resulting in the criminal conviction and the number of points that may be attributed to the licensee; 
c.  That the licensee may request a hearing within ten days. The purpose of the hearing is to allow the licensee to offer corrections to the information; demonstrating such points should not be assessed and action taken by licensee to mitigate the violation; 
d.  That if the licensee does not request a hearing, the city clerk will upon expiration of ten days from the licensee receiving said notice of violation from the city clerk, send notification to the licensee assessing the points as outlined in subsection C. of this section for said violation and shall assess the penalty against licensee as indicated in subsection H. of this section. If the penalty involves a suspension of the license, the city clerk shall specify the dates of the suspension. If the decision involves a fine, the city clerk shall specify the date of payment of fine to the city clerk or city clerk shall specify the points acquired to licensee; 
e.  That should the licensee want a hearing the licensee has ten days from receiving said notice of violation from the city clerk to make a written request of the city clerk for a hearing.

A suspension or fine assessed by a hearing examiner may be stayed pending final order on the appeal. The hearing examiner's action may be set aside by the city council if it finds the action to be: 
1.  Arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law; 
2.  Without observance of the procedure required by law; or 
3.  Unsupported by substantial evidence. 
H.  Penalties for the Accumulation of Points. Penalties provided in this section are based on the accumulation of points against a licensee within a twelve-month period beginning the first day of March through the last day of February of each year. Also, any points accumulated during this period of time involving the same licensed premises may be used by city council to determine a gross violation and/or the basis for filing a complaint in district court for revocation of the licensee's license as provided herein and in subsection I. of this section. Points accumulated during this twelve-month period of time shall expire upon the last day of February and the violation and assessed points shall no longer be part of the point system or considered in any future twelve-month period of time for suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of license involving the same licensed premises.

Chapter 5.80 - CHARGES FOR BASIC CABLE TELEVISION EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES 
Sections: 

5.80.010 - Scope and applicability-Definitions. 
A.  This chapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment within Laramie, for any franchisee which has been notified that (1) the city has been certified to regulate its basic service and equipment rates; and (2) the city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic service and equipment rates. The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent with all Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations governing the regulation of basic service rates and equipment including but not limited to Federal Communications Commission Report and Order 93177, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Rate Regulation, adopted April 1, 1993, and released May 3, 1993, or as amended, and the city will regulate and interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations as if those regulations were set forth in full herein; the franchisee is prohibited from engaging in any activity it is prohibited in engaging in under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in full herein. If enforcement of any provision would be prohibited under FCC rules, the provision shall not be enforced, but all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. For purposes of these provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic cable service" has the same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 CFR Section 76.901 and the term "equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47 CFR Section 76.923.

    "U.S.C." means the United States Code currently in effect, or as amended. 
(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.020 - Filing and review of rates. 
A.  Initial Filings By Franchisees. 
1.  Filings-When Made. A franchisee that is notified that its basic service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission ("the rate filing") within thirty days of the notification (but is not required to make a filing any earlier than November 15, 1993), justifying its then-existing basic service and equipment rates. All rates for all customer classifications must be justified. Once a franchisee has been so notified by the city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates announced prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to regulation where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic service or equipment rates or any new basic service or equipment rate (collectively referred to herein as rate increases). An "increase" occurs when there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer services. Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review at least thirty days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase. This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement; 
2.  Filing-Where Made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the city manager. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the required rate filing and all required copies are received by the city manager. Four copies of each rate filing (including all supporting materials) must be submitted. If any part of the rate filing contains information that is claimed to be proprietary under applicable FCC rules, the franchisee also must file two copies with the proprietary information removed; 
3.  Filing-Contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the rates the franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules: 
a.  Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter whether it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The covering letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part based upon cost of service, and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service, 
b.  The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially, 
c.  The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these forms must be correctly completed, 
d.  If different rates are being charged or are to be charged for different customers or classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law; 
4.  If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of service, the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an opportunity to recover its reasonable costs, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly profits in any form; 
5.  In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of service must submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses it incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly by the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. Section 522(4). The cost of service must identify the accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations) at which each expense or revenue identified was aggregated and show clearly how the expense or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving Laramie is a part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate for: 
a.  Operation and maintenance expenses, 
b.  Administrative and general expenses, 
c.  Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and copyright fees separately), 
d.  Costs for PEG access and any institutional network, 
e.  Franchise fee expenses, 
f.  Investment in the system and associated depreciation, 
g.  Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes, itemized, and 
h.  The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by the franchisee; 
6.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to submit the cost of service specified in subsection (A)(5) of this section for equipment rates, and instead initially shall complete, submit and support the costs of equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any cost of service submitted to justify basic service rates must show that the cost of service does not include equipment costs. Where there is no applicable FCC form that is to be used to support an equipment charge, the franchisee shall submit sufficient information to demonstrate that the price it proposes to charge recovers only its costs plus a reasonable profit. 
B.  Initial City Review. 
1.  After receiving a rate filing, the city manager promptly shall publish a notice that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties seven days to submit written comments on the filing to the city manager. The city manager shall submit the comments received and recommendations for action to the city council and shall make those comments and recommendations available for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than five business days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the city council and the franchisee. The response shall be filed with the city manager, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the city manager shall forward a copy to the city council. In the city council's discretion, for good cause, the time for filing of public comments or for the filing of the operator's response to those comments and staff recommendations may be extended. The time for filing shall not be extended if the extension might result in the city failing to meet FCC-mandated deadlines; 
2.  Within thirty days of the date of the filing, the city council shall issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the city council denies a proposed rate, it should provide a written explanation. If the city council tolls the rate in whole or in part, its written order at least shall explain that it requires additional time to review the rate filing and state that the franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing as provided in subsection C of this section. With respect to existing rates, tolling means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect to rate changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is tolled may not go into effect. 
C.  Supplementary Filings. 
1.  If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee shall submit a supplementary filing twenty days from the date the tolling order issues, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any required supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the city manager and any additional information supporting the proposed rate. Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with subsection (A)(2) of this section; 
2.  A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the city directs the franchisee to provide;

The city manager shall submit the comments received and recommendations for action to the city council. The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than ten days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the city council.

In the city council's discretion, for good cause, the time for filing of public comments or for the filing of the operator's response to those comments and staff recommendations may be extended. The time for filing shall not be extended if the extension might result in the city failing to meet FCC-mandated deadlines; 
5.

If the city council issues an order allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 CFR Section 76.933; 
6.  The order specified in subsection (B)(5) of this section shall be issued ninety days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies based on the FCC benchmark.

(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.030 - Provisions generally applicable to rate orders. 
A.  Unless the city specifies otherwise in its rate order or unless otherwise required to comply with applicable federal rules, any rate order of the city council shall be issued and effective upon the first day of the following month. Each rate order shall be released to the public and the franchisee. In any case where the city council approves, denies, or tolls a rate; orders that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating that the order has issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be in writing. 
B.  The city council may take any steps that it is not prohibited from taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may require refunds, set rates, and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or through its delegated representatives, and enforce refund orders. No penalties shall be imposed, however, based only on a finding that the franchisee filed for approval of rates later found to be unreasonable. Any order prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisees proposed rate was unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the city council shall ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the city manager propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the franchisee at the time it is submitted to city council shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this notice and the franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to the recommendations. 
C.  No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the city shall have the right to reduce a franchisees rates and to require the franchisee to refund any amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by federal law. 
(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.040 - Franchisees' duties. 
A.  A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty days of the date the city council issues an order mandating a remedy. 
B.  Within ninety days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of the cable company stating: 
1.  Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of the city council's order; and 
2.  Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the city council's order; and 
3.  Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and distributed. 
C.  It is each franchisees' responsibility to keep books and records of account so that it can refund any amounts owed to subscribers. 
D.  It is each franchisees' duty to submit as complete a filing as possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this chapter. 
E.  Information Requests. 
1.  A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or expenses that are allocated to the franchisee's system must respond to requests for information from the city by deadlines established by the city. A franchisee is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the city's requests; 
2.  Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response to a filing by a franchisee before the order contemplated by Section 5.80.020(B) issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to written requests for information regarding its filing within five days of the date an information request is mailed to it. The information may include the information the franchisee would be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing; 
3.  All notices or other information requested by these regulations or by the city shall be mailed to the city manager; provided that any notices triggering a response due in ten days or less shall be sent via overnight mail, hand-delivered, or sent via fax with telephone confirmation. 
(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.050 - Duties of city manager. 
A.  The city manager shall be responsible for administering the provisions of this chapter. Without limitation and by way of illustration: 
1.  The city manager shall ensure notices are given to the public and each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations; 
2.  The city manager may submit requests for information to the franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in Section 5.80.040; 
3.  For good cause, the city manager may waive any provision herein or extend any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters that are mandatory under FCC regulations; 
4.  The city manager shall rule on any request for confidentiality; 
5.  The city manager shall prepare the recommendations to the city council contemplated by Sections 5.80.020(B) and C. If the city manager recommends that any increase be denied in whole or in part, the city manager shall: 
a.  Propose a rate and explain the basis for its recommendation (it may propose that rates remain at existing levels), and 
b.  Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue, and 
c.  Notify the franchisee of its recommendation at the time it is submitted to the council. 
(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.060 - Penalties and forfeitures. 
    Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall be subject to penalties and forfeitures under the city's general ordinances and its cable ordinances and franchises, and its request for approval of a rate may be denied if it: 
A.  Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in connection with any rate proceeding; 
B.  Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city, including, but not limited to a request for information or an order setting rates; or 
C.  Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation. 
(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.070 - Proprietary information. 
A.  If these provisions, or any request for information requires the production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC Section 552 or Wyoming law, whichever is more protective of the information. The city shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
B.  Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the city manager. The city manager shall weigh the policy considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal. 
(Ord. 1114 § 1 (part), 1993) 
5.80.080 - Petition for change in status.

Chapter 8.56 - SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1668 , § 1, adopted Oct. 21, 2014, amended Ch. 8.56 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 8.56 §§ 8.56.010-8.56.120, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 879, §§ 1-9, adopted in 1986; Ord. No. 1439, §§ 2-18, adopted in 2004; and Ord. No. 1511, § 69, adopted in 2007. 

8.56.010 - Findings. 
A.  The Laramie City Council does hereby find that: 
1.  Numerous peer reviewed studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. At special risk are children, elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. 
2.  Unregulated high-tech smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or "e-cigarettes," closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing a number of electronic cigarettes from two leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA's testing also suggested that "quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent." According to a more recent study, electronic cigarette emissions are made up of a high concentration of ultrafine particles, and the particle concentration is higher than in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke. Electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol or vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions. 
3.  Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, and decreased respiratory function, including bronchoconstriction and broncho-spasm. 
4.  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five to fifty percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. 
B.  Accordingly, the Laramie city council finds and declares that the purposes of the ordinance codified in this chapter are: 
1.  To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and 
2.  To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Chapter 8.60 - UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS 
Sections: 

8.60.010 - Preamble-Emergency declared. 
A.  The city council finds that there is an emergency requiring the immediate enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter to preserve public health and safety, due to: 
1.  The possibility of contamination of a significant portion of Laramie's municipal water supply if underground petroleum storage tanks are installed without adequate design and construction standards within the five-year time of travel area surrounding the Turner wellfield; and 
2.  The ability of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to refuse to permit modifications to the Turner wellfield if there is an existing or potential risk of pollution entering the Turner wells. 
B.  For the reasons stated in Section 8.60.020 of this chapter, the city council finds an emergency concerning the public health and safety. By a three-fourths vote of its qualified members, the city council has suspended the requirements of W.S. 1977, 15-1-15(c), as amended, and the corresponding provisions of this code. 
(Ord. 1158 § 1, 1995) 
8.60.020 - Legislative findings. 
A.  The city obtains approximately sixty-eight percent of its municipal water from a single underground water source, the Casper formation. During the cold months, all of the city's municipal water comes from the Casper formation aquifer. If the Casper aquifer were contaminated, Laramie would face a serious municipal water shortage. The Turner wells, which produce up to four million gallons of municipal water per day from the Casper formation, are located adjacent to a developed and developing area along east Grand Avenue in the city. 
B.  The city commissioned a study by Western Water Consultants, Inc., consulting engineers, to determine how the city could protect the quality of its underground water. As part of the study, WWC produced maps indicating the time of travel of water from locations within the Casper formation to the wells and springs where the city withdraws it. 
C.  The developed/developing area along East Grand lies entirely within the twenty-year time of travel contour. In some locations, the Casper formation has some protection from contamination by the overlying Satanka formation. In other locations along East Grand, the Casper formation is exposed at the surface. For locations within one-half mile to the west of the Casper/Satanka contact in the vicinity of the Turner wellfield, there are indications that the pressure gradient caused by pumping the Turner wells may cause leakage from the Satanka formation into the Casper formation. 
D.  The city has a legitimate governmental interest in preventing contamination of its water sources. Any contamination of the aquifer by hazardous materials is unacceptable. To prevent contamination, while respecting the rights of property owners within the area where contaminants which contact the ground could reach the aquifer, the city council authorized its staff to draft a wellhead and aquifer protection ordinance using the recommendations made by Western Water. The vulnerability of the aquifer, the need for such an ordinance, and council's intention to protect the aquifer, have been a matter of public record in Laramie for two years. Staff has considered at least six drafts of the ordinance and is expected to present a final draft to council for consideration in the next ninety days. 
E.  The city has requested that the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality provide it with standards for the construction of underground storage tanks installed in such proximity to the city's wells that leakage would cause a serious risk to Laramie's municipal water. The DEQ has provided those standards, which are included in this chapter. 
F.  The city has in place a program to modify the Turner wellfield in order to make it more productive and to reduce the risk of contamination. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality has the authority to refuse to allow modifications to the Turner wellfield (and in fact to require the city to cease using it entirely) if the DEQ finds that there are serious risks to health because of conditions in the area of the wellfield, including but not limited to the presence of underground storage tanks containing hazardous materials. See, e.g., Chapter XII, Sections 6(c)(v)(A)(iii) and 9(b)(B)(i)-(iv) of the Rules of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality Division. 
G.  The conditions for installation of underground storage tanks set forth in this chapter are the least intrusive method of protecting the city's water supply while allowing the reasonable use of private property in the area defined below. 
H.  In the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, the city council intends this chapter to protect a portion of the Casper aquifer which contributes underground water to the city's municipal water system, and to mitigate potential adverse effects upon the aquifer. Council intends to protect human life and health; minimize expenditure of public money for costly pollution remediation; minimize business interruptions; and to insure that the public is provided with a safe potable water supply now and for future generations. 
I.  An application to the city for a building permit to construct a convenience store with associated underground gasoline storage tanks within the five-year time of travel contour for the Turner wellfield, on property within two hundred eighty feet of the city's low-level water reservoirs, has created an emergency. The Department of Environmental Quality states that it cannot enforce standards which will adequately protect the wellfield. The city must have standards in place which will reasonably protect the wellfield.

B.  Pollutant. Pollutant means an organic substance, an inorganic substance, a combination of organic and inorganic substances, or a pathogenic organism that, after discharge and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation or assimilation into an organism either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food chain, could, on the basis of information available to the administrator of EPA, cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, physiological malfunctions (including malfunction in reproduction), or physical deformations in either organisms or offspring of the organisms. 
C.  Time of Travel Contour. Time of travel contour means the contour line shown upon Plate 3-2 of the November 19, 1993 report "Wellhead Protection Area Delineation for Turner Well Field, Pope Well Field, Soldier Spring, and Simpson Springs" prepared by Western Water Consultants, Inc. for the city, showing the amount of time it takes ground water to travel from a recharge point on the land surface to wells, expressed in years. Copies of the pertinent portion of Plate 3-2 are on file in the office of the city planner. 
(Ord. 1158 § 3, 1995) 
8.60.040 - Area where ordinance applies. 
    This chapter applies to all land within the city limits which is within the five-year time of travel contour for the Turner wellfield. 
(Ord. 1158 § 4, 1995) 
8.60.050 - Underground storage tank installation prohibited-Exception. 
    No person shall install (either as new construction or as a replacement for an existing underground storage tank) any underground tank for the storage of hazardous substance(s) or pollutant(s) within the area defined in Section 8.60.040 except as is allowed under Section 8.60.060 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1158 § 5, 1995) 
8.60.060 - Standards for installation of underground storage tanks. 
    Within the area where this chapter applies: 
A.  Except as superseded by specific requirements in this chapter, all requirements of regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the design, construction and operation of underground storage tanks shall be followed. 
B.  All underground storage tanks shall be double-walled and made of fiberglass-reinforced materials and shall be provided with interstitial monitoring (nonbrine type). The tanks must be designed, constructed and installed to: 
1.  Contain a release from any portion of the inner tank within the outer wall; 
2.  Detect the failure of the inner wall. 
C.  All piping connected to underground storage tanks, if it routinely contains hazardous substances, and is in contact with the ground, shall be fiberglass-reinforced plastic piping. Metallic fittings, if used, shall be cathodically protected and monitored, following the recommendations of a qualified corrosion engineer. 
D.  All transfer of liquid hazardous substances from underground storage tanks shall be by suction piping which is designed and constructed to meet these standards: 
1.  The below-grade piping operates at less than atmospheric pressure; 
2.  The below-grade piping is sloped so that the contents of the pipe will drain back into the storage tank if the suction is released; 
3.  Only one check valve is included in each suction line; 
4.  The check valve is located directly below and as close as practical to the suction pump; 
5.  A method is provided that allows compliance with this subsection to be readily determined in the field; and 
6.  Underground piping must be equipped with secondary containment which will contain the capacity of the piping, preventing vertical and horizontal migration of hazardous substances, and must be checked for evidence of a release at least every thirty days. 
E.  Each underground storage tank (or battery of tanks) shall be provided with secondary containment as provided in this subsection. 
1.  A secondary barrier shall be installed around and beneath the tank, consisting of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and impermeable (at least 10 -6 cm/sec for the substance stored), constructed to direct a release to the monitoring point and permit its detection. 
2.  The barrier shall be compatible with the substance stored so that a release will not cause a deterioration of the barrier allowing a release to pass through undetected. 
3.  The groundwater, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling method used inoperative so that a release could go undetected for more than thirty days. 
4.  If the secondary barrier is not always above the groundwater, or is in a twenty-five-year floodplain, then it shall be designed for use under such conditions. 
5.  Secondary containment must be designed, constructed and installed to contain the stored substances if released from the tank system until they are detected and removed, and prevent the release of regulated substances to the environment at any time during the operational life of the underground storage tank system. 
6.  Secondary containment shall be checked for evidence of a release at least every thirty days. External liners must be designed, constructed and installed to contain one hundred percent of the capacity of the largest tank within its boundary, prevent the interference of precipitation or groundwater intrusion with the ability to contain or detect a release of the stored substances, and surround the tank completely (be capable of preventing horizontal and vertical migration of the stored substance). 
F.  Each installation of underground storage tanks shall be served by at least one monitoring well, installed in a location and constructed to standards approved by the city engineer. The location shall be selected so as to enable the detection of contamination in time to recover released hazardous substances before they contaminate the city's groundwater supply. 
(Ord. 1158 § 6, 1995) 
Chapter 8.64 - EXCAVATIONS 
Sections: 

8.64.010 - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that open excavations except foundation holes and trenches made in the ordinary course of construction are a hazard to the public safety and health, cause diminishment of property values, loss of property tax revenues, loss of sales tax revenues in commercial areas, and present a significant hazard to the safety of any adjoining buildings. This chapter is intended to require that open excavations be filled to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(Ord. 1338 § 1, 2000: Ord. 1335 § 1, 2000) 
8.64.020 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter: 
    "Excavation" means a man-made hole in the ground below the surrounding grade where material is or was removed for the purpose of constructing a basement, building foundation of any sort, or utility lines; where the improvements have not been constructed, have been damaged beyond reasonable use, or have been removed. The term does not include excavations designed and used for stormwater detention, nor does it include depressions excavated as part of a landscaping plan or excavations designed and used as part of a recreational facility open to the public. The term does not include excavations in the public right-of-way made by or on behalf of public utilities. 
    Owner/Person. "Person" and "owner" includes natural and legal persons; the officers and directors of any corporation, the members and manager of any limited liability company, and the partners of any partnership.

A.  No person shall excavate, or suffer or permit an open excavation to remain upon property which he owns, leases, or possesses within the city limits except under these circumstances: 
1.  There is a valid building permit for construction (which makes use of the excavation) upon the property or a valid excavation permit; or 
2.  The excavation remains after the destruction and removal of improvements for not more than twenty days, or ninety days if surrounded by a four-foot or higher fence. These periods begin when the excavation is begun, if dug for the purpose of construction; or when exposed, if improvements have been removed or are damaged beyond reasonable use. These periods are tolled while filling operations proceed reasonably. 
B.  The exemptions do not apply if abatement is ordered under other law because of an emergency or because the excavation presents an unreasonable danger to public health or safety. 
(Ord. 1335 § 3, 2000) 
8.64.040 - Revegetation required. 
    When an excavation subject to Section 8.64.030 is filled, it shall be revegetated (minimum standard: commercially available dry land grass mix) or paved with either concrete or plant mix bituminous paving. 
(Ord. 1335 § 4, 2000) 
8.64.050 - Grace period established. 
    Every owner of property upon which there is an excavation which is open as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and which does not meet one or more of the exceptions in Section 8.64.030, shall fill and revegetate that excavation before June 1, 2006. This provision does not prevent the city from sooner ordering abatement under other law because of an emergency or because the excavation presents an unreasonable danger to public health or safety. 
(Ord. 1338 § 3, 2000) 
8.64.060 - Notice of violation. 
    If the city manager or designee determines that an excavation remains open after the grace period allowed by this chapter, he shall cause notice by certified mail to be given to the owner of the property that the property is in violation. If the owner does not fill the excavation in conformity with the standards in this code within thirty days of the mailing of the notice, and revegetate it during the next period March 1 through October 15, the owner shall be deemed the author of a nuisance. Each day that the excavation remains unfilled after the expiration of the thirty-day period is a separate violation. Each day that the excavation remains without revegetation after the October 15 after it is filled is a separate violation. 
(Ord. 1338 § 4, 2000: Ord. 1335 § 5, 2000) 
8.64.070 - Violation-Penalty. 
    Any person who violates this chapter shall be punished as provided in the general penalty provisions of this code. 
(Ord. 1335 § 6, 2000; Ord. 1338 § 5, 2000) 
8.64.080 - Limitations of chapter. 
    This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other law which requires fencing, barricades, signs, lighting, or any other safety precautions required to be taken because of an open excavation.

The test or tests shall be: 
(A)  Incidental to a lawful arrest;

(C)  Administered at the direction of a peace officer who has probable cause to believe the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a street or highway in violation of Section 10.24.010. The peace officer who requires a test pursuant to this section may direct that the test shall be of the blood, breath or urine. However, if the officer directs that the test be of the person's blood or urine, the person may choose whether the test shall be of blood or urine, the person may choose whether the test be of blood or urine.

(iii)  The results from the test or tests under this act shall only be used for the purposes of determining the chemical concentration as provided by this section and shall not be used for any other purpose. 
(b)  Results of tests obtained at the arrested person's expense shall be made available to the arresting officer and to the arrested person. Disclosure of the test results by the person administering the test is not a violation of the doctor-patient relationship. 
(c)  Any person dead, unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of cooperating with the administration of the tests is deemed to have given his consent provided by subsection (a) of this section and the tests may be administered subject to the provisions of this act. 
(d)  If a person under arrest refuses upon the request of a peace officer to submit to a chemical test designated by the agency employing the peace officer as provided in subsection (a) of this section, none shall be given except in cases where serious bodily injury or death has resulted or upon the issuance of a search warrant. A test of the agency's choice may be administered upon the issuance of a warrant, including a remotely communicated search warrant, when reasonable under the circumstances and as provided in this subsection.

If the tests are available they shall be performed in or near the locality where the arrest was made as promptly as possible after the arrest. 
(d)  The person tested may, at his own expense, have any qualified person of his own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of the peace officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admissibility in evidence of the test or tests taken at the direction of the peace officer.

Chapter 10.46 - LOCALLY DETERMINED RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING ON PUBLIC STREETS 
Sections: 

10.46.010 - Purpose. 
    The Laramie city council finds: 
A.  There are residential areas within the city which are near or adjacent to the campus of the University of Wyoming, and which are unduly affected by commuters who attend, visit, or are employed by the university. 
B.  Persons employed upon or using the university campus frequently park their vehicles on nearby residential streets, resulting in serious problems for the residents. Within the area described in this chapter, there is a heavy concentration of commuter vehicles which are parked all day and in the evening, creating blighted or deteriorated residential areas. These vehicles cause congestion on residential streets, impede the movement of traffic, and unduly restrict entry of residents to their homes. 
C.  This chapter will help to protect children and other pedestrians from bodily injury. 
D.  This chapter will help to protect real and personal property from damage by reducing hazardous traffic conditions caused by the heavy use of residential streets by nonresidents and transients. 
E.  This chapter will help to protect those residential areas from polluted air, excessive noise, and trash and refuse caused by the presence of such vehicles. 
F.  This chapter will help to promote efficiency in the maintenance of those streets in a clean and safe condition; to preserve the residential character of those areas; and will reduce dangers arising from the blocking of fire lanes, hydrants and other facilities required by emergency vehicles. 
G.  This chapter will help to facilitate the movement of traffic in the event of accidents and disasters; and will protect the residents of those areas from unreasonable burdens in gaining access to their residences caused by long-term storage parking by persons not residing within the areas. 
H.  A residential permit parking ordinance is necessary to promote the general health, safety, welfare and integrity of those residents and residential areas. 
I.  This chapter is designed to allow a locally initiated permit system to allow residents of the areas described below to determine the character and use of their own neighborhoods. 
(Ord. 1142 § 1, 1998) 
10.46.020 - Definitions. 
    "Block face" means the side of a platted block between right-of-way lines of intersecting streets. For the purposes of this chapter, a reverse corner lot (a corner lot having its side street line substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the first lot to its rear) is considered as a part of the block face where the street address of the property is located. 
    "City manager" refers to the city manager and to any person to whom the city manager delegates authority under this chapter. 
    "Commuter vehicle" means a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a person not a resident thereof and who is attending, employed by, or doing business at the University of Wyoming. 
    "Opposite block faces" means block faces which face each other, entirely or partially, across the same street. 
    "Parcel" for the purposes of this chapter means a platted lot, parcel described by metes and bounds, or combination of fractional or complete platted lots, under common ownership. 
    "Residential areas" means contiguous or nearly contiguous areas containing public streets or parts thereof primarily abutted by residential property or residential and nonbusiness property such as schools, parks, and churches.

Such an application is treated as an application for two opposite block faces. 
b.  An application on behalf of any property within Area B which faces upon Grand Avenue may include property on the adjacent or nearest side of the closest intersecting north-south street. 
c.  The owner or occupant of property which faces upon Grand Avenue and is not adjacent to any intersecting street is entitled to parking permits in any district formed upon the same block. 
5.  Each person signing an application hereunder shall provide proof of ownership (if signing as an owner) or proof of residency (if signing as a resident). Proof of ownership may be any document which in the opinion of the city attorney reasonably establishes that the person signing is the owner of the property for which he/she is voting. Proof of residency may be a signed lease, utility bills for at least two billing periods, or other documentary evidence which in the opinion of the city attorney reasonably establishes that the persons signing is a resident of the property for which he/she is voting. 
6.  The application shall contain this information: 
a.  The names and addresses of the applicants. 
b.  A description of the area for which designation is sought. 
c.  The name and address of each property owner within the proposed residential permit parking district. 
d.  The legal description and address of each parcel of property within the proposed district. 
e.  For each structure within the district that contains two or more separate living units, the address and all apartment numbers. 
f.  The valid signatures of at least sixty percent of the owners and renters determined in accordance with the count allocation method contained in this chapter. 
i.  Each signer shall write his/her name, address, and date of signing upon the application. Any name appearing on the application not conforming to the residency or ownership requirements at the time of submittal of the application, and any illegible names, shall be stricken and shall not be included in calculating the count. Any signer may withdraw his/her name by filing a signed request with the city manager before the count is completed. After the city manager has completed the count, no name may be withdrawn. 
ii.  Each application shall have appended thereto a certificate, signed before a notary public by the person who submits the application, stating, "I hereby certify under penalty of perjury that each signature on this application was signed by the person purporting to have signed the application." 
g.  The days of the week during which parking within the district shall be by permit only. Saturdays and Sundays may not be included. District permit parking hours shall be from six a.m. to six p.m. local time. 
h.  Such other information as is requested by the city manager. 
i.  If the application is not submitted within ninety days of the date the first signature was obtained, or is signed by less than sixty percent of the required signatures representing owners and residents of the proposed district, then the petition shall be denied. 
7.  a.  An applicant who owns or occupies a lot located upon a corner of any block where there is not a residential permit parking district along the front line of the property may apply to have a residential permit parking district along the front line of the property may apply to have a residential permit parking district established on the side line of the lot. 
b.  The application may be granted if the city manager or his/her designee makes the required findings and if establishment of the district will not entitle the applicant to permits for districts on more than one block face. 
c.  If the side line of any property is included in any properly established residential parking district, the owner or occupant of that property may acquire a residential parking permit in that district. 
d.  An owner or occupant may hold a residential parking permit in a district which includes the property's front line, or the side line when allowed under this subsection, but not both. 
B.  Allocation of Counts. 
1.  Each parcel which has an address within a block face shall have two counts. (i.e., a house with an address of 501 with a basement apartment with an address of 5011/2; has a total of two counts. A building which has more than one living unit which has a single address or more than one address has two counts regardless of the number of apartment units.) 
2.  If the parcel is renter-occupied, one count shall be allocated to the tenant and one count to the owner. If the parcel is not occupied, or if the owner's primary dwelling is on the parcel, the owner receives both counts. The owner of a vacant lot receives two counts. 
3.  If the parcel has frontage on the block but does not have an address that contains the street name for that block, the parcel does not count with that block face. 
4.  If a single parcel has more than one tenant, the tenant count shall be determined on the basis of the preference of a majority of all current tenants of the parcel (for example, if there are fifteen tenants, and eight sign the application, the tenant count for the parcel is in favor of the district). 
5.  The University of Wyoming is allocated two counts with respect to each block face which is opposite to any portion of its main campus, to be counted with any application which includes it. For University property in platted subdivisions outside of the main campus, the University shall be treated as any other owner. 
6.  A corporation, limited liability company, or partnership is allocated the count(s) of a natural person regardless of the number of persons who have ownership interest in the entity. 
7.  A parcel which is owned or occupied in any form of common ownership (joint tenancy, tenancy by the entireties, or tenancy in common) shall be counted as agreed between the common owners. 
8.  Fractional counts are not permitted. 
C.  Notice of Application. Upon receipt of an application for designation of a residential permit parking district and payment of the required fee, the city manager shall cause a notice describing the area for which designation is sought to be mailed to the address of each parcel and to each owner shown upon the application. The city manager shall make a reasonable effort to cause the notice to be sent to each apartment in the proposed district. 
D.  Subsequent Applications. For one year following the denial of an application upon the grounds that an inadequate number of valid signatures appeared upon it, no new application for the proposed area or any portion thereof shall be accepted for filing. 
(Ord. 1142 § 4, 1998; Ord. 1310 § 2, 2000; Ord. 1410 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1416 § 2, 2003)

A.  City Manager to Review. The city manager shall review the application for conformity with this chapter and shall issue an order denying or granting the application and establishing the residential permit parking district as applied for. An order denying an application shall contain findings setting forth reasons, which may include but are not limited to an incomplete application, failure to contain the required percentage of signatures, failure to establish proof that signatures are valid, or failure to meet all of the criteria set forth in subsection B. of this section. A finding that the application has been reviewed and found to be in conformity with the policies and criteria set forth in subsection B. of this section is sufficient for the city manager to approve the application and establish a residential permit parking district for the proposed area. 
B.  Criteria for Approval. Approval of an application for establishment of a residential permit parking district shall be based on consideration of the following criteria: 
1.  The desire or need of residents of the area for establishment of permit parking zones. 
2.  The application in all respects conforms to the requirements of this chapter. 
3.  The ability of the city to recover costs associated with the establishment of the permit parking district through permit fees and fines for parking violations within the district. 
4.  Whether the valid signatures upon the petition constitute sixty percent of the owners and residents determined according to the allocation of counts set forth above. 
5.  Whether there is consistently a significant amount of long-term or spillover parking from the University of Wyoming. 
6.  Whether residents frequently find it difficult to park on-street within close proximity to their residences. 
7.  The proximity of adequate public transportation to the area. 
8.  The local and area-wide needs with respect to clean air, and the requirements of federal and state laws and regulations. 
9.  Whether the designation may result in a reduction in total vehicle miles driven within the city. 
10.  The district is a minimum of one-half block face and is in a residential area. 
    If the city manager finds that the proposed district is not proper under the above criteria, he may refuse to establish the district or may reduce its boundaries. 
(Ord. 1142 § 5, 1998; Ord. 1310 § 3, 2000) 
10.46.060 - Establishment of district. 
    If the city manager finds that the criteria for approval have been met, he shall order that the district be established. The city manager shall place, replace, repair, maintain and remove signs designating residential parking districts established under this chapter. Upon placement of signs designating the district, formation of the district is complete. 
(Ord. 1142 § 6, 1998) 
10.46.070 - Parking permits. 
A.  Application. A person who resides in a residential parking district and who desires to obtain a resident parking permit shall submit an application on a form prescribed by the city manager. The application shall contain:

2.  Acceptable proof of residence at an address within the district. 
3.  Evidence of valid registration of the motor vehicle for which the permit is sought. 
4.  Make, model, color and license plate number of the motor vehicle for which the permit is sought. 
5.  Such other information as the city manager shall require in order to determine that a permit should be issued under this chapter. 
B.  Ineligible Vehicles. A resident permit shall not be issued for a motor vehicle that is not owned by the applicant or his or her parent or legal guardian. Only one resident parking permit may be issued per registered vehicle owned or operated by a person residing within the permit district. 
C.  Issuance of Resident Permit. Upon receipt of a permit application and payment of the required fees, one permit for the requested motor vehicle shall be issued to the vehicle owner or operator who resides on or owns property within the designated area. The permit shall identify the residential permit parking district and shall contain the license number of the vehicle for which issued. Permits are not valid in any other permit parking area or for any vehicle other than the one identified thereon. Resident permits may not be transferred except as is provided in subsection E. of this section. 
D.  Duration and Renewal of Permit. Each permit is valid for a term of one year beginning September 1 and ending August 31 of the following year. Permits issued after the commencement of the term shall be for the unexpired portion of the term, with the fee to be prorated in one-month increments. 
E.  Transfer. Permits may not be transferred from one vehicle to another unless the vehicle for which the permit was issued is sold or otherwise disposed of. If the holder of a valid permit returns the original permit to the city and provides the information required above in subsection A of this section, the city shall cancel the old permit and issue a permit for the new vehicle for the unexpired portion of the permit term. 
F.  Special Permits.

In the event the type of consolidation used in replacing the backfill is not adequate to prevent further settling or the moisture content is excessive, temporary resurfacing shall be provided. If temporary surfacing is provided, the top surface of the backfill shall be covered with bituminous material at the following minimum thicknesses: 
A.  One inch in sidewalk locations: 
B.  Two inches wherever excavation is made through pavement, alley approaches or driveways; 
C.  At major intersections and other critical locations a greater thickness may be ordered by the administrative authority. 
    Such temporary paving material shall be cold mix, except that the permittee may use or the administrative authority may require hot mix. All temporary paving material shall conform closely enough to the level of the adjoining paving surface and shall be compacted so that it is hard enough and smooth enough to be safe for pedestrian travel over it as well as for vehicular traffic to pass safely over it at a legal rate of speed. The permittee shall maintain temporary paving for a period not exceeding thirty days after all backfilling is completed, unless additional time is required by the administrative authority and shall keep the same safe for pedestrian and vehicular traffic until the excavation has been resurfaced with permanent paving; except, that if it is impractical to maintain the surface of the temporary paving in a safe condition for pedestrian travel or vehicular traffic, then the permittee shall maintain barriers and lights as required by this chapter.

Another special event permit or a malt beverage or catering permit for special events or an open container permit application has been received prior in time or has already been approved for the same time and place requested by the applicant or so close in time and place to that requested by the applicant that the issuance of both permits would cause undue traffic congestion or cause the city police or fire departments to be unable to meet the needs for police or fire services for both events; 
10.  The location of the special event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon city streets; or 
11.  The special event will violate a city ordinance or state statute.

13.22.040 - Responsibility. 
    Implementation of this chapter requires full cooperation of the consumer and the City of Laramie; the responsibilities of each party are delineated below. 
A.  Customer. The customer has the primary responsibility for preventing pollutants from entering the potable water system or the public water system. The customer shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross-connections on the premises by installing, at minimum, an approved backflow device at the customer's expense that provides containment from the public water system. This does not preclude the need for any additional isolation devices that may also be required within the internal plumbing system. Such backflow containment device shall include associated installation, maintenance, protection, testing, repair, removal or replacement of the device as required by the department as a condition of service. At the department's discretion, installation of the approved backflow device shall, at a minimum, be placed in an approved location at or near the property line or within a building. All costs shall be at the customer's expense and shall include all necessary equipment/enclosures to ensure uninterrupted service and meet all installation safety codes. 
B.  The City Building Official. The city building official has the responsibility to review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed so as to prevent cross connections or installations of any type that would be in violation of the adopted plumbing code. 
C.  The department has the responsibility of owning, operating and maintaining the public water system beginning at the source of supply and including treatment and distribution, and ending at the point of delivery to the customer. The department shall be responsible for the protection of the potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the department, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required at the customer's water service connection; or, within the customer's private water system for the safety of the water system, the department shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on the premises. This shall apply to any new or existing water service connection. The customer shall install such approved assembly(s) within the time frame set forth in the notice and at the customer's expense; and, failure, refusal, or inability of the customer to install, have tested, and maintain said assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
(Ord. No. 1544, 12-2-2008) 
13.22.050 - Inspection and maintenance requirements. 
A.  It shall be the duty and responsibility of the customer at any location where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have inspections and testing by a certified cross connection control technician at least once per year at the customers' expense. All necessary repairs shall be the responsibility of the customer. 
B.  Backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed in water supply lines to provide at least the degree of protection stipulated in the most recently adopted version of the plumbing code. 
C.  The customer shall keep records for three years of all testing and repairs performed on backflow prevention assemblies and shall also furnish to the department copies of all testing and repairs to any containment device. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to schedule such tests to meet this requirement. 
D.  The department reserves the right to inspect and potentially require existing systems to install suitable backflow prevention assemblies if, based upon an evaluation of risk to the public water system, there is a potential to compromise the safety of the public.

If the owner of property coming within the purview of this section neglects or refuses to make such connection, the city council shall direct the city engineer to notify such owner or his agent to do so. The city engineer shall thereupon comply with such order of the city council and notify such owner or his agent to make or cause such connections to be made. The owner or his agent shall comply with such notice within thirty days from the service of such notice. Every such thirty days' neglect, after service of such notice, shall constitute a separate offense; provided, that where the drainage is such that it is impossible or impracticable to make such sewer connection, this section shall not apply. 
(Prior code § 32-9) 
13.28.020 - Before streets are paved. 
    Before any street or alley is paved, the owners of all property abutting thereon where a sanitary sewer is laid shall make proper sewer connections with such sanitary sewer, whether the immediate use thereof is required or not.

(Prior code § 32-15) 
13.28.080 - Procedure. 
    Whenever a sewer connection is made, the required trench shall be opened an ample width to permit easy inspection and the removal of all rubbish. If there is no junction piece in the sewer, a connection may be made by inserting into the sewer a "T" saddle of the size specified in the permit required therefor. After making the opening, which shall be done with great care so as to not injure the sewer, all rubbish shall be carefully removed from inside the main sewer. All connections of one line of sewer pipe with another shall be made with "Y" branches or "T" saddles and long radius eighth bends. The interior of each length of pipe and the inside of the last joint shall be made perfectly clean before the next joint is laid. All joints of vitrified clay pipe shall be set in an approved mastic type joint filler. Slip on type joints of a type approved by the city shall be acceptable. The "T" saddle may be inserted into the sewer and set even with the inside of the sewer on a bed of mortar and the opening around the pipe carefully repaired and well plastered with an approved mastic type joint filler. In connecting pipe with pipe, a "Y" junction or "T" saddle shall be used and the main sewer left in as good a condition as before the work was done. When a connection is made to a sewer main, the service line shall not be connected thereto until the connection has been inspected and approved by the city. 
(Prior code § 32-16)

(Prior code § 32-21) 
13.32.050 - Mains-Minimum size. 
    The minimum size of sewer mains constructed as a part of the city sewer utility shall be eight inches in diameter. 
(Prior code § 32-22) 
13.32.060 - Mains-City's share of cost. 
A.  Except in such instances where a single sewer district, subdivision or development under one ownership requires a main greater than eight inches in diameter, the city shall participate in the cost of installing larger sized mains. The extent of city participation shall be based on the following percentages of the total cost of sewers greater than eight inches in diameter: 
1.  For ten-inch mains, the percentage of the city's participation shall be fifteen percent; 
2.  For twelve-inch mains, the percentage of the city's participation shall be twenty-five percent; 
3.  For fifteen-inch mains, the percentage of the city's participation shall be thirty-five percent; 
4.  For eighteen-inch mains, the percentage of the city's participation shall be forty-five percent; 
5.  For mains larger than eighteen inches in diameter, the extent of city participation shall be determined by the city council. 
B.  In those instances where a district, subdivision or development under one ownership is of such size that mains larger than eight inches in diameter are required, the entire cost of such oversize mains shall be paid by the district or subdivider. 
(Prior code § 32-23) 
13.32.070 - Subdivisions-Main extension contract. 
    No sewer shall be constructed in a platted subdivision approved after April 17, 1962, until the subdivider and the city have executed a sewer main extension contract. 
(Prior code § 32-24) 
13.32.080 - Subdivisions-Installation by subdivider-Exception. 
    The subdivider shall install the mains in his subdivision by contract upon approval of the plans and specifications by the city, execution of sewer extension contract and city inspection of actual construction; provided, that the city may elect to install the mains, in which case the subdivider shall deposit with the city the estimated cost of the sewer construction, plus engineering and administrative costs. The city shall then proceed to construct the sewer under contract. If at any time the actual cost exceeds the amount deposited, the subdivider shall immediately deposit sufficient funds to complete the work. 
(Prior code § 32-25) 
13.32.090 - Subdivisions-Subdivider to pay costs. 
    The subdivider shall pay the costs of construction of all sewer mains and appurtenances to, in and through his subdivision, except as otherwise provided in this division. Sewer mains shall always be extended to the farthest point or points upgrade in a platted subdivision so that the system may be perpetuated. 
(Prior code § 32-26) 
13.32.100 - Subdivisions-Undeveloped areas. 
    When a subdivider finds it necessary to construct a sewer through undeveloped areas to serve his platted subdivision, the entire cost of such sewer line shall be paid by the subdivider unless the oversize main provisions of Section 13.32.060 are applicable. At the time of annexation or as the property abutting such sewer is developed and connections are made to the sewer, the city may collect a charge per front foot based upon the original construction cost and if so collected shall reimburse the original subdivider to the extent of the collections so made; provided, that in no event shall such reimbursement exceed the total cost of the sewer. A subdivider's right to reimbursement under the provisions of this section shall terminate fifteen years after execution of the sewer extension contract. 
(Prior code § 32-27) 
13.32.110 - Extension to city property not part of subdivision-Special assessment. 
    Extension of sewers to serve property within the city, but not a part of a subdivision platted after April 17, 1962, shall be financed by special assessment against the benefitted property or under such terms and conditions as the city council provides by resolution. 
(Prior code § 32-28) 
13.32.120 - Pumping stations-Liability for costs. 
    When pumping stations are required, the cost of constructing such stations shall be the responsibility of the property served thereby. In those instances where it appears that more than one platted subdivision may be served by the pump station, the city may require a larger capacity than that necessary to serve the initial development. Where such larger capacity is required the additional cost may be paid by the sewer utility and thereafter collected from other property owners or subdividers connecting to lines served by the pump station. Such charges shall be paid prior to the time any connections are made. 
(Prior code § 32-29) 
13.32.130 - Force mains serving areas otherwise unable to enter sewer utility.

(Prior code § 39-61; Ord. 556 § 1, 1978; Ord. 586 § 1, 1979; Ord. 952 § 1, 1988; Ord. 1222 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1317 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1362 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1389, § 1, 2002; Ord. 1430 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1463 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1488 § 1, 2006; Ord. No. 1531, § 1, 7-15-2008; Ord. No. 1564, § 1, 8-4-2009; Ord. No. 1593, § 1, 1-4-2011; Ord. No. 1603, § 1, 8-2-2011; Ord. No. 1651, § 1, 10-15-2013; Ord. No. 1675 , § 1, 12-16-2014; Ord. No. 1724 , § 2, 12-20-2016) 
13.44.020 - Billing periods. 
    The water utility shall bill water users not less than once every three months and not more often than once a month. 
(Prior code § 39-60) 
13.44.030 - Cost determination when meter defective. 
    Where a meter is broken or defective or for any reason does not correctly measure and record all the water used on any premises in any one quarter or where the proper city employee is unable to enter and read the meter after two attempts to read the meter, the charge for water used on such premises during that quarter shall be as follows: 
A.  Residential users shall be charged an amount based on the average consumption for residential users for the same quarter during the previous three years.

(Prior code § 39-66; Ord. 707 § 1, 1982) 
13.44.050 - Annual debt service and water use. 
    The city council finds that the annual debt service for water system improvements for the city of Laramie is six hundred thirty four thousand dollars. The city's water rates are intended to include adequate provision for debt service in times of normal water use. The state climatologist, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Geological Survey state that the areas which provide municipal water for the City of Laramie are within a drought warning area. In 2002, the Laramie River had the lowest flow in one hundred years at Woods Landing, just above the city's municipal water diversion. The city council recently adopted an ordinance to allow the imposition of mandatory outdoor water use restrictions. If those restrictions are successful, Laramie water customers will use less water, reducing the city's ability to make its debt service payments. The water utility loans are secured by mortgages and security interests in the city's water system. If any of the loans go into default, the Wyoming Water Development Commission could foreclose and either become the owner of the city's water utility or sell it to another party. It is not in the city's best interest to lose control of its water service utility. To assure timely repayment of the loans in times of drought, the city must maintain adequate water revenues in times of reduced water use. 
(Ord. 1415 § 1, 2003) 
13.44.060 - Water rate surcharge. 
    The city council may adopt resolutions to impose, remove and reimpose water rate surcharges during the months of May through October in response to identified drought conditions. The purpose of water rate surcharges is to assure the repayment of water utility indebtedness in times of reduced water use and to encourage municipal water conservation. Each resolution shall specify the duration of the surcharge, which shall be in increments of regular water meter readings. Council may extend or terminate the surcharge at any time by resolution. 
(Ord. 1415 § 2, 2003) 
13.44.070 - Surcharge rate-Consumption. 
    When the city council adopts a resolution finding that a municipal water conservation emergency exists and that a surcharge should be imposed, all municipal water rates for all water users and districts connected to the City's municipal water supply shall pay a surcharge based upon consumption as follows: 
A.  All residential customers shall pay a surcharge of $0.83 per thousand gallons for all water used during any month in which outdoor water use restrictions are in effect. The residential customer surcharge applies to customers which are water districts as well. If an outdoor water use restriction is in effect during any portion of a month, the surcharge will be imposed for all water use during that month. 
B.  All commercial accounts (excluding water districts which have commercial accounts) shall pay a surcharge of forty-two cents per thousand gallons for all water used during any month in which outdoor water use restrictions are in effect. If an outdoor water use restriction is in effect during any portion of a month, the surcharge will be imposed for all water use during that month. 
(Ord. 1415 § 3, 2003) 
13.44.080 - Drought surcharges. 
    All drought surcharges collected under this chapter shall be placed in a separate account and shall be used solely for repayment of water utility secured indebtedness. 
(Ord. 1415 § 5, 2003) 
13.44.090 - Low income affordable municipal services rates. 
A.  Notwithstanding the charges for municipal water service established elsewhere in this code, eligible households as defined in this ordinance shall receive a monthly credit of thirty-seven dollars and fifty-eight cents towards the municipal services bill. 
B.  Households where the applicant meets these criteria are eligible households: 
1.  The applicant must own the property where municipal services are being billed. 
2.  The applicant must reside at the address for at least nine months per year. 
3.  Municipal utilities must be billed to the applicant. 
4.  The applicant must be able to demonstrate current enrollment in a federal program in which a low income is a necessary qualification. Accepted programs are Social Security Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The city will also accept other federal income assistance programs as proof at the discretion of the city manager or city manager's designee. 
5.  The applicant must not have any delinquent amount associated with his or her municipal services billing account. 
6.  The applicant shall submit an application and supporting documentation to the city. 
7.  The city manager, or city manager's designee, shall be responsible for reviewing all applications, as well as approving complete and qualifying applications. 
C.  Each applicant for the water rates established by this section shall complete and submit an application to the city upon a form prescribed by the finance division. The form shall request the information necessary to establish eligibility and shall be verified under oath by the applicant. The following supporting information shall be submitted with the application. 
1.  Proof of current enrollment in a federal program in which a low income is a necessary qualification. 
D.  Households receiving the rate established in this section shall report to the city any change in circumstance which makes them ineligible. The applicant must reapply for the program on an annual basis, with the reapply deadline set for the first of June every year.

    "Composite sample." 
1.  Composite method: 
a.  It is recommended that effluent operational data be obtained through twenty-four-hour flow proportional composite samples. Sampling may be done manually or automatically, and discretely or continuously. If discrete sampling is employed, at least twelve aliquots should be composited. Discrete sampling may be flow proportioned either by varying the time interval between each aliquot or the volume of each aliquot. All composites should be flow proportional to either the stream flow at the time of collection of the influent aliquot or to the total influent flow since the previous influent aliquot. 
b.  Effluent sample collection need not be delayed to compensate for hydraulic detention unless the POTW elects to include detention time compensation or unless the approval authority requires detention time compensation. The approval authority may require that each effluent sample is taken approximately one detention time later than the corresponding influent sample when failure to do so would result in an unrepresentative portrayal of actual POTW operation. The detention period should be based on a twenty-four-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow should in turn be based on the average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year.

13.78.050 - Regulations. 
1.  General Discharge Prohibitions. 
a.  General Prohibitions. A user may not introduce into a POTW any pollutant(s), which cause pass through or interference. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in Section 13.78.050 apply to each user introducing pollutants into a POTW whether or not the user is subject to other national pretreatment standards or any national, state or local pretreatment requirements. 
2.  Affirmative Defenses. A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions established in Section 13.78.050 and the specific prohibitions [of] Section 13.78.050 where the user can demonstrate that: 
a.  It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources would cause pass through or interference; and 
b.  A local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case may be, was developed in accordance with Section 13.78.050 for each pollutant in the user's discharge that caused pass through and/or interference, and the user was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
c.  If a local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case may be, has not been developed in accordance with Section 13.78.050 for the pollutant(s) that caused the pass through and/or interference, the user's discharge directly prior to and during the pass through and/or interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the POTW's NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for biosolids use or disposal. 
3.  Specific Prohibitions. 
a.  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent nor any single reading be over ten percent of the lower explosive limit for the substance tested for. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which the city, the state or the EPA has determined is a fire hazard, explosion hazard, or a hazard to the system, and any waste stream with a closed cup flash point of less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit or sixty degrees Celsius using the test methods specified in 40 C.F.R. Section 261.21; 
b.  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half-inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, hay, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes, 
c.  (a)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided for all uses for which they are required under the Uniform Plumbing Code in effect in the city from time to time, or installed or modified when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease or floatable oil in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful substances, except that interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. Modifications to existing interceptors may be required when the user's discharge is in violation of this chapter. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent (unless type and capacity are clearly prescribed by the Uniform Plumbing Code) and shall be located so as to be readily accessible for cleaning and inspection. The city of Laramie has deemed it necessary to formalize its grease control program (listed below). Therefore, every user located within the approved boundary for accepting grease at the POTW shall abide by these rules or their wastes will not be accepted and enforcement actions listed in Section 13.78.120 may be carried out: 
(i)  Each user shall keep on record for a minimum of five years a record of all cleaning and other maintenance done to its grease trap or grease filtering device. The records shall be available to the superintendent for review upon request. The frequency of cleaning shall be approved by the superintendent and may be reviewed for revisions as a result of management practices. 
(ii)  Each user shall provide the superintendent with a copy of the record created during the most recent cleaning or maintenance activity within five days of the cleaning or maintenance taking place. 
(iii)  The superintendent will keep these records on file to ensure proper cleaning and maintenance is taking place on a yearly basis. 
(iv)  If proper maintenance and cleaning is not taking place, a fine will be charged to the user. This fine serves as compensation for the need of additional sewer cleaning and repair of damaged property due to sewer back-ups. 
(b)  Any wastewater having a pH less than or equal to five or greater than or equal to twelve, unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or wastewater having any other property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, or personnel of the POTW; 
(c)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, to constitute a hazard to humans or animals, to create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, to cause or contribute to the concentration of pollutants in wastewater biosolids, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act; 
(d)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to health or life or are sufficient to prevent or hinder entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair; 
(e)  Any substance which alone or in conjunction with other wastes may cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit; or other product of the POTW such as residues, biosolids, or scum, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance be discharged to the POTW which may cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with biosolids use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 or 503 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting biosolids use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the biosolids management techniques being used; 
(f)  Any grease or oil of petroleum or animal fat origin or nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin which alone or in conjunction with other pollutants could potentially cause pass through or interference within the system. The POTW reserves the right to limit the amount of oils and grease discharged by any commercial or industrial user; 
(g)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the wastewater temperature entering the POTW treatment plant exceeds forty degrees centigrade (one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit) unless the approval authority, upon request of the POTW, approves an alternate temperature limit; 
(h)  Any pollutant which results in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
(i)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions; 
(j)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants, released at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or quantities of pollutants that exceed for any period longer than fifteen minutes more than five times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operation; 
(k)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
(l)  No person shall introduce truck or tanker-hauled waste of any nature into the POTW or the city's wastewater collection system except at a location designated by the superintendent, and with such notice as the superintendent shall require. The superintendent may require evidence of the source and quality of hauled wastes and may prohibit the introduction of hauled waste into the POTW and the city's wastewater collection system. The superintendent may adopt procedures for the protection of the POTW which include but are not limited to, requiring waste disposal manifests and an annual license or permit required to be obtained by each waste hauler under reasonable standards. Any waste hauler who is aggrieved by a licensing or permit decision of the superintendent may appeal the decision to the city council. The superintendent may establish and amend a schedule of charges sufficient to cover the costs of accepting and treating truck or tanker-hauled waste. The city council may change the schedule of charges from time to time by minute action; 
(m)  No person shall introduce solids, sludges, filter backwash or other pollutants removed in the course of pretreatment into the POTW.

b.  The city may issue general permits to control regulated industrial users and may adopt best management practices (BMPs) for users as needed to implement this chapter. BMPs may be implemented through a permit, order or notice. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of this part and Section 307 (d) of the Act. 
c.  Any other specific pollutants identified by the city may also have specific effluent permit limitations set by the city to restrict their discharge into the system. The superintendent may set such limits. 
5.  Superintendent's Powers. When the superintendent determines that a user is contributing any of the above-enumerated substances (or heat) to the POTW in amounts which interfere with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent may: 
a.  Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; 
b.  Develop effluent limitations for the user to correct the situation; 
c.  Require the user to cease the contributions; 
d.  Prevent the user's waste stream from entering the POTW; and 
e.  Take any enforcement action authorized by this chapter.

The superintendent shall notify all affected users of which he has knowledge, of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. Section 403.12. 
7.  Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal categorical pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" means reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. Section 403.7(c)(2), "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 C.F.R., Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval of the approval authority is obtained. 
8.  State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter. 
9.  City's Right to Revise. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if necessary or convenient to promote the objectives of this chapter. 
10.  Prohibition Against Dilution as Treatment. Dilution prohibited as substitute for treatment. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The control authority may impose mass limitations on industrial users, which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
11.  Hazardous Waste Discharge. 
a.  The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the Industrial User discharges more than one hundred kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve months. All notifications must take place within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e). 
b.  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 40 CFR 403.12 (p)(1) during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. 
c.  Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
d.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as hazardous, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety days of the effective date of such regulations. 
e.  In the case of any notification made under paragraph 40 CFR 403.12 (p), the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
12.  Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans. The superintendent shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges. 
b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 13.78.070; and 
d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
e.  Whenever the facility changes its operations in such a way as to change the potential for slug discharge, the plan must be updated. 
13.  Reports of Potential Problems. 
a.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the superintendents of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
b.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to any person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability, which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
c.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in Section 17.78.050. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
d.  Significant industrial users are required to notify the superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
14.  Records. 
a.  Any industrial user and POTW subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section, including documentation associated with BMP. Such records shall include for all samples: 
(i)  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples; 
(ii)  The dates analyses were performed; 
(iii)  Who performed the analyses; 
(iv)  The analytical techniques/methods used; and 
(v)  The results of such analyses. 
b.  Any industrial user and POTW subject to the reporting requirements established in this section (including documentation associated with best management practices) shall be required to retain for a minimum of five years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the director and the regional administrator (and POTW in the case of an industrial user). This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or POTW or when requested by the director or the regional administrator. 
c.  Any POTW to which reports are submitted by an industrial user pursuant to Section 13.78.080 shall retain such reports for a minimum of five years and shall make such reports available for inspection and copying by the director and the regional administrator. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or the operation of the POTW pretreatment program or when requested by the director or the regional administrator. 
15.  Sample Collection Procedures. 
a.  The reports required in any paragraph in Section 13.78.080 must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The city of Laramie shall require a frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless the control authority authorizes time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for the facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. 
b.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in Section 13.78.080, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 13.78.080, the control authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users and applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
c.  Analytical Requirements. All analyses, including sampling results submitted in support of any application, reports, evidence, or analysis required by any permit or order shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R., Part 136 and amendments thereto, or, if 40 C.F.R., Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. All testing shall be performed by a laboratory certified for the procedures used. 
16.  Confidential Information. Information and data (other than effluent data) about a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the release of the information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When a confidentiality claim is asserted, the information shall be treated as confidential until a determination is made by the superintendent. Effluent data shall not be made confidential. 
17.  When the user furnishing a report satisfies the POTW that the user has made the demonstration required by Section 13.78.050, the portions of any report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be available for inspection except by the city, state or EPA for uses related to this chapter. Confidential portions of a report shall be available for use by the city, state or EPA in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person or user furnishing the report. Effluent data will not be recognized as confidential information. Right of entry, inspection, and sampling. Representatives of the POTW, the state, and the EPA, upon showing proper identification, shall be permitted to enter and inspect the premises of any user who may be subject to the requirements of this chapter to determine whether the user is in compliance with all requirements of this chapter, wastewater contribution permit, or order. Industrial users shall allow representatives of the POTW, the state, and the EPA access to all premises at all times under the circumstances for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examining or copying records and the use of digital photos during inspections and monitoring in the performance of their duties. The EPA, state and city shall have the right to install on the user's property devices, equipment, and access locations necessary or convenient to conduct sampling and monitoring. Where a user has security or safety measures in force, the user shall make arrangements in advance at the user's expense so that EPA, state, and city personnel are permitted to enter the premises for the purposes expressed in this section. The POTW shall inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once per year. 
18.  All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharges, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403 12(p). 
( Ord. No. 1687 , 8-18-2015) 
13.78.060 - Administration. 
1.  Wastewater Discharges.

u.  Record keeping requirements. 
2.  Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time as determined by the superintendent, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period of less than one year. A permit may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for a new permit a minimum of ninety days before the expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit are subject to modification by the superintendent during its term as limitations or requirements as identified in this chapter or in the permit are modified, or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in the permit at least thirty days before the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable schedule for compliance. 
3.  Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation at a specific location. A wastewater discharge permit is void if it is assigned or transferred; or if the permittee is sold or leased to a new owner or new user, or is moved to different premises, without, at a minimum, prior notification the POTW and provision of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator. A wastewater discharge permit may not be used for a new or changed process or operation without the advance approval of the superintendent in writing. 
4.  Permit Modification. The superintendent may modify an individual wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
b.  To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of the individual wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
c.  A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the city's POTW, city personnel, or the receiving waters; 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the individual wastewater discharge permit; 
f.  Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting; 
g.  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13; 
h.  To correct typographical or other errors in the individual wastewater discharge permit; or 
i.  To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with Section 13.78.070.1. 
5.  Permit Appeals. A permit applicant may appeal to the city manager from the denial of a permit by the superintendent or from the superintendent's decision to issue a permit with conditions, upon the grounds that the superintendent's decision is contrary to law, is arbitrary and capricious, or is not supported by substantial evidence. The following rules shall apply to appeals under this section: 
a.  A written petition for review shall be submitted within ten days of the decision appealed from, indicating which permit provisions are objected to, the reasons for the objection, and any alternative conditions sought. Failure to submit a timely petition is a waiver of the right to appeal. 
b.  Conditions of the permit are not stayed pending appeal. The city manager shall within thirty days of receipt of the written petition hold a hearing upon the appeal. The city manager may designate a hearing officer to hear and decide the appeal. The petitioner and the superintendent and their witnesses may be heard at the hearing, in person or through counsel. Following the hearing, the city manager or hearing officer shall promptly issue a written decision. 
c.  The city council may adopt and amend rules of practice and procedure for hearings under this chapter. 
d.  The city manager's decision is a final action for the purposes of judicial review. 
e.  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the city manager's decision shall do so in accordance with Wyoming law. 
6.  Continuation of Expired Permits. There is no continuation of permits that have reached the expiration date. 
7.  Special Agreements. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent special agreements between the POTW and a user whereby wastewater of unusual strength or character is accepted in the POTW. No discharges violating pretreatment standards shall be allowed by special agreements. 
8.  Monitoring. 
a.  Users shall provide and maintain in a safe and proper condition, at their own expense, facilities to allow the representatives of the POTW, EPA, or the state to inspect, sample, or measure flows from all wastewater subject to this chapter. 
b.  Each user shall provide ample room in or near the user's facilities to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. 
c.  If locating such facilities on a user's property is impractical because of space limitations, the user may apply to the city for permission to construct sampling locations in the public right-of-way at a location designated by the superintendent. 
d.  The sampling facilities and location are subject to the approval of the superintendent. The superintendent may require changes in sampling facilities and in sampling facility location if he or she finds that the facilities provided by a user do not afford reasonable access. 
9.  Bypass. 
a.  Bypass Prohibited. Bypass is prohibited. The POTW may take enforcement action against an individual user for a bypass unless: 
(i)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage. 
(ii)  There are no feasible alternatives to bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed to prevent bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(iii)  The industrial user submitted the notices required by this section. The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the two conditions listed in the Section 13.78.090(I)(2)[sic]. 
b.  Notice. 
(i)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible, otherwise as soon as the need becomes known to the user. 
(ii)  An industrial user shall orally notify the POTW immediately of any unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. The user shall provide a written statement to the POTW within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written statement shall contain a description of the bypass, including exact times and dates, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the time during which the bypass is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned (with timetable) to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass. 
10.  Upset Provisions (limited to categorical pretreatment standards only). 
a.  Definition. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
b.  Effect of an Upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of the next subsection are met. 
c.  Conditions Necessary for Demonstration of Upset as Affirmative Defense. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
(i)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(ii)  The facility was designed and constructed so that under normal operation (and including routine maintenance) there would be no upset; 
(iii)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operations and maintenance procedures; and 
(iv)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and the superintendent within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset. (If this information is provided orally, a written submission must follow within five days of the time when the user became aware of the upset): 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken or planned (with timetable) to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
11.  Burden of Proof. In an enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof. 
12.  User Responsibility in Case of Upset. The industrial user shall control production or control all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided. This requirement applies as well when the primary source of power of the pretreatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
( Ord. No. 1687 , 8-18-2015) 
13.78.080 - Reporting. 
1.  Baseline Report for Categorical Discharges Only. 
a.  Industrial users subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit baseline reports to the POTW in a form and at such times as are prescribed by the superintendent. 
b.  Within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of a national categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty days after a final administrative decision has been made upon a categorical determination submission in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Section 402.6(a)(4), whichever is later, industrial users which are existing sources subject to such National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to the POTW shall submit a properly completed baseline report. 
c.  New sources, when subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, shall submit a baseline report at least ninety days before commencement of discharge to the POTW. 
d.  In support of the baseline report, the industrial user shall submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the following information: 
(i)  Name and address of the facility including the names of the operator and owners; 
(ii)  List of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
(iii)  Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by the user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes; 
(iv)  Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
1.  Regulated process streams; and 
2.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(e). 
(v)  The superintendent may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows. 
Measurement of Pollutants. The user shall identify the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process; 
1.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. Any and all additional monitoring shall also be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR Part 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority; sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator; the control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
(vi)  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(vii)  The report shall contain a statement to be reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in paragraph 1. of this section) and certified to be a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
e.  Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted and required in subsection 1.d.: 
(i)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress stated as dates for completing design, construction, and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(ii)  No increment of progress in subsection 1.e(i) shall exceed nine months. 
(iii)  Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent, including, at a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return to the schedule established. No more than nine months shall elapse between progress reports. 
f.  Such other information as may reasonably be requested by the superintendent. 
2.  Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards Deadline. Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the superintendent a report containing the information described in subsections 1.d(iv) through (vi). Where equivalent mass or concentration limits are established by the POTW for a user, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. Where a user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, the report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of an industrial user, and certified to by a qualified waste treatment professional. 
3.  Periodic Compliance Report. 
a.  Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date for the pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the POTW during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the POTW, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in compliance with subsection 3.b. At the discretion of the POTW and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, and the like, the POTW may agree to change the months when the above reports are to be submitted. 
b.  The POTW may impose mass limitations on users which are lawfully using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection 3.a. of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the POTW, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. 
c.  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the POTW in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(c), the report required shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
4.  Significant Noncategorical Industrial Users. Significant noncategorical industrial users, including users subject to best management practices, shall submit to the POTW at least once every six months, on dates specified by the POTW, a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants, including documentation associated with best management practices, required to be reported by the POTW. The POTW may require any significant industrial user to comply with the reporting requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter if in the opinion of the superintendent the POTW requires the information in order to meet applicable law. 
5.  Monitoring and Analysis in Support of Self-Monitoring Requirements. 
a.  The reports required in this chapter shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 C.F.R., Part 136 and amendments thereto by a laboratory certified in the procedures used. Where 40 C.F.R., Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the administrator. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the POTW in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW itself collects all of the information required for the report, the significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
b.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of both analyses to the POTW within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation, except that the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
(i)  The POTW performs sampling at the industrial user's location at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(ii)  The POTW performs sampling at the industrial user's location between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of the user's initial sampling. 
c.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in this chapter monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in this chapter, then the results of this monitoring shall be included in the user's reports. 
d.  The reports required in subsections 5.a. and c. shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The POTW shall require monitoring on a frequency sufficient to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
e.  The reports required by this section shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Section 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed by an authorized representative. 
6.  Report Requirements for Non-significant Industrial Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the superintendent as the superintendent may require. Such reports may include those set forth in this section as well as the industrial waste survey and business information form. 
( Ord. No. 1687 , 8-18-2015) 
13.78.090 - Fees. 
1.  In establishing and changing industrial or business use fees for the POTW, the city council may consider all applicable factors, including but not limited to the following: 
a.  Reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the POTW pretreatment program, and including the cost of plant investment, supplies, equipment and personnel; 
b.  Monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures including the cost of reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users. 
2.  In addition to fees of general application, the POTW may charge user-specific fees based upon the actual cost for personnel, supplies and equipment, for the following: 
a.  Reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
b.  Permit applications, to include the cost of processing permit applications; 
c.  For filing appeals; 
d.  For sewer maintenance as a result of improper maintenance of pretreatment equipment. 
3.  Such other fees as the city council may determine to be necessary or convenient from time to time to carry out the requirements contained in this chapter. These fees shall relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the POTW. 
4.  The city council may establish and change fees under this section by separate ordinance. 
( Ord. No. 1687 , 8-18-2015) 
13.78.100 - Sewer use charges. 
1.  The city will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than those specified in Section 13.48.006 of the Laramie Municipal Code for normal strength wastes of residential users. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above normal strength waste. Such users will pay an additional service charge of 0.026 dollars per one thousand gallons for each twenty-five milligrams per liter over two hundred milligrams per liter of BOD and 0.00 dollars per one thousand gallons for each twenty-five milligrams per liter over two hundred fifty milligrams per liter TSS. 
    The sewage flow or discharge volume shall be the quarterly water usage measured by water meter readings. If a nonresidential user has substantial water usage during the summer months for lawn watering, the volume of flow will be determined in the manner identified for nonresidential users pursuant to Section 13.48.019 of the Laramie Municipal Code. 
2.  Monitoring. All significant industrial users shall, at their own expense, monitor their discharge to determine their industrial classification rates. 
3.  Exemption from Monitoring. All industrial users other than significant industrial users shall be exempt from self-monitoring for the purpose of this subsection. Any industrial user choosing to monitor its discharge may do so at its own expense. 
4.  Sewage Volume Measurement. 
a.  Any commercial, institutional or industrial user may measure the actual sewage flow in lieu of basing the sewer use charge on metered water use. In such cases, the conditions set forth in subsections 4.b. and c. apply. 
b.  Any commercial, institutional or industrial user receiving non-metered water shall either install water meters for all non-metered sources or provide sewage flow measurement in accordance with the conditions set forth in this chapter. 
c.  All meters for non-metered water sources and sewage flow measurement devices shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the superintendent. All costs of design and installation shall be borne by the user. The user shall guarantee in writing that the POTW shall have access to the meter or meters for meter readings whenever in the POTW's opinion the meter(s) should be read. 
5.  Review of Wastewater Service Charges. 
a.  The POTW shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment system, and each user's percentage of wastewater contribution, at least once per year. The superintendent shall recommend to the city manager any revisions to the service charge system which are needed to assure that the system is equitable and that sufficient funds are obtained to administer this chapter and to operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. 
b.  If a significant industrial user has completed in-plant modifications which the user believes will change the user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user may provide the superintendent with the facts which the superintendent determines to be relevant to a decision about modification of the user's wastewater service charges. If the facts provided by the user demonstrate to the superintendent's satisfaction that the BOD and TSS loading from the user's plant have been reduced to a lesser classification as a result of in-plant changes, then the superintendent is empowered to reclassify the user for the purpose of wastewater service charges beginning with the billing period following the billing period in which the decision is reached. 
6.  Each user shall be notified annually of the sewer use charge rate and the portion of the user's charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment services. The notice may be included upon one or more utility bills sent by the city, or may be a separate notice, in the superintendent's discretion. 
7.  Failure of the city or any of its employees or departments to comply with subsections 5. and 6. shall not invalidate sewer use charges or rates. 
( Ord. No. 1687 , 8-18-2015) 
13.78.110 - User fees. 
    The city council finds that it is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, and necessary for the effectiveness of the POTW, for the city to collect user fees from all users who contribute wastewater to the city's treatment works. The proceeds of those charges shall be used for the construction, operation, maintenance, replacement, and other related costs of the wastewater treatment systems as determined by the POTW. 
1.  Payment. Each user shall pay a user charge for the services provided by the POTW based on its use of the treatment works as determined under the ordinance codified in this chapter and any other applicable ordinance. This subsection does not affect other sewage fees charged by the city or the POTW. 
2.  Residential, Industrial and Commercial Contributors. 
a.  User charges for residential contributors shall be based on the user's average water consumption as determined by water meter readings, as provided elsewhere in this code. 
b.  User charges for industrial and commercial contributors shall be based on water used each billing period. If an industrial or commercial contributor uses water which is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based on a wastewater measuring device or a separate water meter or meters installed and maintained at the contributor's expense, or any other method acceptable to the city. 
3.  Charges Adopted. 
a.  User charges shall be established by a current schedule of charges adopted by the city council in another ordinance. The schedule of charges may be amended by the city council from time to time. 
b.  For those users contributing wastewater which does not meet the definition of normal domestic wastewater, a surcharge shall be collected according to the formula of surcharges in Section 13.78.100.1. The formula of surcharges may be amended by the city council from time to time. 
4.  Toxic Pollutants. Any user discharging any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing (including disposal) the effluent or biosolids from the treatment works, or any user discharging any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes increases in the costs of operation and maintenance of the treatment works, shall pay all of such increased costs. The strength and characteristics of effluents may be determined by the city, or by agreement between the user and the city, based upon data. Such users shall be assessed a surcharge according to the formula of surcharges or schedule of surcharges adopted by the city council as amended from time to time. 
5.  All Users. User charge rates shall apply to all contributors to the treatment works, regardless of the origin of the discharge. 
6.  Review. The superintendent shall review the schedule of user fees and surcharges annually and suggest revisions to the city manager as necessary to ensure adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance of the treatment works, and to ensure proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs between all users. 
7.  Notification. The superintendent shall notify each user annually of the rate being charged for operation and maintenance. 
8.  Replacement Account. The city shall establish and maintain a replacement account throughout the useful life of the treatment works. There shall be deposited into this account two thousand dollars per month. Funds from this account may be used for replacement or repairs necessary or convenient to assure that the treatment works reaches its useful life. 
( Ord. No. 1687 , 8-18-2015) 
13.78.120 - Enforcement. 
1.  Administrative Enforcement Remedies. Upon reasonable suspicion that an industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, if there is no imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of any person, the POTW, or the environment, before using any of the enforcement procedures below, the superintendent shall attempt to notify the industrial user by telephone. If the industrial user requests the superintendent to explain the industrial user's permit or the section of this chapter or the order said to have been violated, the superintendent shall confer with the industrial user. If the superintendent is unable to contact the industrial user by telephone, or if the industrial user does not request a conference, or if at the conclusion of the conference the superintendent concludes that the problem is not resolved, or if in the superintendent's judgment there is an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of any person, the POTW, or the environment, the superintendent may pursue any of the enforcement remedies below. Reasonable suspicion may be based upon sampling results, solvent odors coming from manholes or cleanouts, solvent odors at the POTW headworks, oil slicks in the POTW, or any other indication that an industrial user may not be in compliance with this chapter. 
2.  Notice of Violation. When the superintendent finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the superintendent shall serve upon that user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of receipt of notice, the user shall submit an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof, to include specific required actions. Submission of the plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
3.  Consent Orders. The superintendent is hereby authorized to enter into consent orders, assurance of voluntary compliance, and other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Consent orders shall include compliance schedules, stipulated fines, remedial actions, and signatures of the superintendent and authorized user representative. 
4.  Show Cause Order. The superintendent may order any user which causes or contributes to violation of this chapter to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The superintendent shall serve notice upon the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action. Notice of the hearing shall be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the user, and mailed at least ten days before the date set for the hearing. 
5.  Compliance Order. When the superintendent finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the user's sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operating, and compliance is achieved. Orders may contain such other requirements as in the superintendent's judgment are reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance. 
6.  Cease and Desist Orders. When the superintendent finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist all violations immediately. The following apply to cease and desist orders: 
a.  In an emergency, as determined in the superintendent's discretion, the order to cease and desist may be given by telephone. 
b.  In nonemergency situations, the cease and desist order may suspend or permanently revoke industrial wastewater discharge permits. 
c.  The cease and desist order may require the industrial user to take such appropriate or preventive action as may in the superintendent's discretion, be necessary to address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
7.  Administrative Fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user found to have violated any provisions of this chapter, or any permit or order issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars per violation, in the discretion of the superintendent. Each day on which noncompliance occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Administrative fines may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charges. Users who desire to dispute administrative fines must file a request for the superintendent to reconsider a fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the superintendent believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen days of receiving the request. 
8.  Collection of Charges and Fines. The city shall have all collection remedies available to collect the fines as are available to collect charges for utility services, and any other remedy provided by law. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a lien against the user's property. 
9.  Emergency Suspensions. 
a.  The superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service, the wastewater permit, or both, of an industrial user whenever necessary in his opinion to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of any person, the POTW, or the environment. 
b.  Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment, wastewater permit, or both, shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge. Should a user fail to comply voluntarily and immediately with the suspension order, the superintendent shall take such steps as are necessary, in his opinion, including but not limited to, immediate severance or stoppage of the user's sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, hazard to human health; or endangerment to life or the environment. The superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment passes, unless permit termination proceedings are initiated against the user. 
c.  Any industrial user responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. The statement shall be submitted to the superintendent not more than five days after the endangerment incident. 
10.  Termination of Permit. Significant industrial users who violate the following conditions of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state or federal law, are subject to permit termination. Conditions which can lead to permit termination are: 
a.  Violation of any permit condition; 
b.  Failure to report accurately the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; or 
d.  Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
e.  A noncompliant user will be notified of the proposed termination of its wastewater permit by a show cause order and shall have an opportunity for a hearing to determine why the proposed action should not be taken. 
11.  Sewer Service Suspension if User Refuses Access or Information. 
a.  Each user and each contributor mentioned in Section 13.78.050(N)[sic] shall allow the superintendent to have access upon request to the user's premises and to take such samples as the superintendent determines are necessary so that the superintendent may determine whether or not the user has a discharge which may be regulated under this chapter. 
b.  Each user shall supply the superintendent with such information as the superintendent shall require concerning the user's discharges, processes, raw materials, and waste treatment, so that the superintendent may determine whether or not the user has a discharge which may be regulated under this chapter. 
c.  If any user refuses or fails to allow the superintendent to have adequate access, samples, or information under subsections 11.a. and b., the superintendent may prevent the user from discharging into the city's wastewater collection system and the POTW until the user complies. The superintendent may suspend sewer service to the user by any means available to prevent the user from discharging into the city's wastewater treatment system or the POTW. This remedy is in addition to any other remedy available under this chapter. 
d.  Recurring Violations. The superintendent will impose or seek to impose increasingly severe sanctions for recurring violations. This section is not intended to require the POTW or the superintendent to seek a lesser sanction for a violation which is serious enough to justify the sanction sought. 
12.  Procedure for Suspending or Revoking Permits or Suspending or Terminating Sewer Service. 
a.  The superintendent may suspend or revoke a user's permit, or suspend or terminate sewer service to a user, when the user violates federal or state laws or regulations relating to wastewater discharge, any provision of this chapter, or any permit or order issued under this chapter. Suspensions or revocations of permits, and suspensions or terminations of sewer service, shall be made according to the following procedure: 
(i)  The user shall be notified by the superintendent by certified mail at least seven days before suspending or revoking a permit or suspending or terminating sewer service. The notice shall set forth with particularity the reasons such action is contemplated. The time requirement in this subsection does not apply if the superintendent finds that there is an emergency due in whole or in part to the user's discharge. 
(ii)  Upon receipt of notice, the user may request a hearing before the superintendent. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and must be received by the superintendent within seven days of receipt of the notice. Failure to make a timely request for a hearing is the equivalent of a waiver of the right to a hearing. 
(iii)  If the user requests a hearing, the superintendent shall set a hearing date, time, and location. The superintendent shall notify the user in writing by certified mail of the time, date and location of the hearing. The superintendent may preside at the hearing or may appoint a hearing officer to hear and decide the case. 
(iv)  Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. 
b.  If the superintendent has reason to believe that by reason of an actual or threatened discharge a user is threatening the health, safety, and welfare of the public, environment, city employees, or the operation of the POTW, the superintendent may immediately and without notice enter an order suspending or revoking a permit, or suspending or terminating sewer service. Notice of this order shall be served upon the user, stating with particularity the grounds relied upon for the action taken. The user may, within two days of receipt of notice, request in writing a hearing before the superintendent. If no timely request for a hearing is delivered to the superintendent, the right to a hearing on an order issued under this subsection is waived. Such a hearing will be held within two business days of receipt of the request for hearing. The user may waive the two-day hearing requirement upon request. A request for a hearing does not stay operation of the order. 
13.  Judicial Enforcement Remedies. If any person discharges sewage, industrial, or other wastes into the POTW in violation of this ordinance or any order or permit issued hereunder, the superintendent, through the city attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal or equitable relief, or both, in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
14.  Injunctive Relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, the superintendent may, in addition to remedies available under this chapter, seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements. 
15.  Civil Penalties. 
a.  Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars per violation per day for as long as the violation continues, plus actual damages incurred by the POTW. In addition to the penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement, including but not limited to, sampling, monitoring, laboratory charges, and expert witness fees. 
b.  The superintendent shall petition the court to impose and assess penalties and damages. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained by an industrial user through the violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the user, and such other factors as justice requires. 
c.  To the extent allowed or required by Wyoming or federal law, or both, the Laramie Municipal Court is authorized and empowered to hear and determine the civil penalty aspect of any case brought in that court by the superintendent. 
d.  The superintendent, in his discretion, may determine which court or courts to bring any action in, and may seek civil penalties in one court and damages in another. 
16.  Criminal Prosecution. 
a.  Violations Generally. Any industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both. 
b.  Falsifying Information. Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or any permit issued under this chapter, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly makes inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter or any permit, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not exceeding seven hundred fifty dollars or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both. 
c.  Persons Liable. If the industrial user is a corporation, any director, any officer, and any employee or agent with managerial authority is punishable as a principal. If the industrial user is a partnership, any general partner and any employee or agent with managerial authority is punishable as a principal. If the industrial user is a limited liability company, any owner of units in the company and any employee or agent with managerial authority is punishable as a principal. 
17.  Annual Publication. The superintendent shall publish, at least annually, in a newspaper lawful for legal advertisements, a description of those industrial users which are found to be in significant noncompliance with any provisions of this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the previous publication.

In no case shall the city be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements, covenants, or agreements between private third parties.

D.  Whenever a condition or limitation is included in an administrative action authorizing regulatory activity, then it shall be conclusively presumed that the authorizing officer, commission, or board considered such condition or limitation necessary to carry out the spirit and intent of this code, and that the officer, commission, or board would not have granted the authorization to which the condition or limitation pertained except in belief that the condition or limitation was lawful.

2.  Staff Review of Application. Upon submission of an application, the city manager's office, along with any consultants the city retains to review the proposed application and advise city officials and agencies, shall review the application and accompanying documentation for legal sufficiency, consistency with related prior approvals, completeness (in terms of quality of submittals to enable detailed city review), compliance with technical plan and report requirements, conformance with the provisions contained in applicable sections of this code, consistency with the adopted comprehensive plan for the city, and conformance with applicable specific plans and relevant city policies. Staff shall complete its review within twenty-one calendar days from the date the city accepts the application and application fee.

D.  Variances. 

1.  Purpose. The variance process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this code in those cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this code. It is not intended that variances be granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this code may impose on property owners in general. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this code render the land difficult or impossible to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested. State and/or federal laws or requirements may not be varied by the city. 
2.  Procedures. 
a.  Step 1: Pre-Application Meeting. Not applicable.

(i)  Board of Adjustment Action. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide on variance applications. 
(ii)  Review Criteria. 
(1)  The board of adjustment shall not approve a variance unless it finds in writing that all of the criteria below have been met: 
(a)  There are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the board's findings, that are peculiar to the land or building for which the adjustment is sought and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood, and have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the code, such as irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot, or exceptional topographical conditions; 
(b)  The circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of the code would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building; 
(c)  If applicable, the circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of the code would deprive the applicant of access to alternative forms of energy such as solar and wind power; 
(d)  The granting of the adjustment is necessary for the reasonable use thereof and the adjustment as granted is the minimum adjustment that will accomplish this purpose; 
(e)  The granting of the variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; and 
(f)  The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property. 
(2)  A variance shall not be granted that violates the intent of this code or its amendments. 
(3)  A variance shall not authorize a use other than those permitted in the district for which the variance is sought; also, an application or request for a variance shall not be granted with regard to any parcel of property or portion thereof upon which an active zoning request, including Planned Unit Developments, for any parcel of property or portion thereof has not been finally acted upon by the city council.

E.  Conditional Use Permits. 

1.  Purpose. The city of Laramie recognizes that certain uses may be appropriate in a specific zoning district, but which may have characteristics that, depending upon the location, design, and standards of operation, may have a greater impact than permitted uses on adjoining properties, businesses, or residences. Such uses require more comprehensive review, including the ability of the city to establish specific conditions for the project in order to mitigate any potential adverse impacts. 
2.  Applicability. All uses listed as "conditional" in Section 15.10.000, table of uses, shall be required to follow the procedures set forth below. The planning commission shall evaluate only those conditional uses listed in Chapter 15.10 or uses determined similar pursuant to subsection 15.28.020.E., and shall be empowered to grant, grant with conditions, or deny any application for a conditional use permit in accordance with this code.

F.  Major Temporary Use Permits. 

1.  Purpose. The city of Laramie recognizes that some uses are temporary in nature and may provide a benefit to property owners and the community without adverse impacts. The purpose of this section is to provide a process that ensures proposed temporary uses can be accommodated with adequate review by the city to mitigate any potential adverse impacts. Further, this section differentiates between major and minor temporary use permits to ensure adequate procedures for each. 
2.  Applicability. No use that is classified as a major temporary use in Section 15.10.030 shall be placed or established on private property without first receiving a temporary use permit pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subsection.

J.  Minor Administrative Modifications. 

Figure 15.06-2: Minor administrative modifications of up to ten percent may be approved administratively. A maximum of ten percent of any quantitative development standard or setback, as shown above, may be granted if the criteria of subsection 15.06.060.J.3.e are met. 
1.  Purpose. This section sets forth the required review and approval procedures for "minor administrative modifications." Minor modifications may include either or both of the following: (a) Minor deviations from otherwise applicable standards that may be approved by the city manager's office, board of adjustment, planning commission, or city council; or (b) streamlined review processes in cases involving changes to structures and/or sites that are not significant enough to require the full formal design review process per subsection 15.06.060.O. Minor modifications are to be used when the minor degree of the modification requested, and the unlikelihood of any significant adverse effects on nearby properties, the neighborhood and the city make it unnecessary to complete a formal design review or variance process. 
2.  Applicability. 
a.  Minor Modifications to General Development and Zoning District Standards. As part of the review and approval of any application set forth in this chapter, the city manager's office may approve minor modifications of up to a maximum of twenty percent from the following general development and zoning district standards, provided that the applicable approval criteria below are met. The city council and planning commission may also grant minor modifications in the course of any discretionary review pursuant to the requirements of this section. 
(i)  Setback requirements (Section 15.12.000); or 
(ii)  Quantitative development standards set forth in Chapter 15.14, Development standards (e.g., number of parking spaces). 
b.  Minor Modifications to Existing Building and/or Site Design(s). The city manager's office may administratively approve minor changes to existing buildings and/or sites that would otherwise require a complete design review process as specified in subsection 15.06.060.O of this title. Such administrative approval shall follow the steps in this subsection. Minor changes eligible for this streamlined review process are as follows: 
(i)  Parking lot repairs or improvements that do not involve reconstruction of the travel surface. For purposes of this subsection, the term "reconstruction" shall include removal of asphalt and/or base or replacement of drainage facilities that necessitate removal of asphalt and/or base; provided, however, that minor repairs or maintenance as specified in subsection 15.22.000.F shall not in and of themselves be deemed reconstruction; 
(ii)  Changes to existing buildings that meet all of the following criteria: 
Additions that do not exceed eight hundred square feet floor area or ten percent of the building's existing floor area, whichever is less; and 
Additions or modifications that do not include any increase in parking area (whether required or voluntary). 

c.  Exceptions to Authority to Grant Minor Modifications. Notwithstanding subsections a. and b. above, except as permitted in other provisions of this code (e.g., PUD, subsection 15.06.070.C) no decision-making authority shall approve a minor modification that results in:

K.  Alternative Equivalent Compliance. 
1.  Purpose. Alternative equivalent compliance is a procedure that allows development to meet the intent of the design-related provisions of this chapter through an alternative design. It is not a general waiver or weakening of regulations. Rather, the procedure permits a site-specific plan that is qualitatively equal to or better than the strict application of a design standard specified in this code. This procedure is not intended as a substitute for a variance or administrative modification or a vehicle for relief from standards in this chapter. 
2.  Applicability. 
a.  The alternative equivalent compliance procedure shall be available only for the following sections of this title: 
(i)  Section 15.14.040, parking and off-street loading; 
(ii)  Section 15.14.050, landscaping and screening standards; 
(iii)  Section 15.14.060, transportation, mobility, and connectivity; 
(iv)  Section 15.14.080, residential design standards; 
(v)  Section 15.14.090, commercial design standards; 
(vi)  Section 15.14.100, fences and walls; and 
(vii)  Section 15.14.110, lighting. 
3.  Pre-Application Conference Required. An applicant proposing to use alternative equivalent compliance under this section shall request and attend a pre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan for the development, to determine the preliminary response from the city manager's office. Based on that response, the design review plan application shall include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the alternative compliance requested. 
4.  Procedures. A request for alternative equivalent compliance is made as part of a standard application process pursuant to the appropriate specific review procedure identified in this chapter. 
5.  Decision-Making Responsibility. Final approval of alternative equivalent compliance under this section shall be the responsibility of the decision-making body responsible for deciding upon the application. By-right projects that would not ordinarily require review under this code, yet which are proposing alternative equivalent compliance, shall require written approval of the alternative equivalent compliance from the city manager's office prior to or concurrently with project approval. All applications for alternative equivalent compliance shall be processed and reviewed in a timely fashion. 
6.  Criteria. To grant a request for alternative equivalent compliance, the decision-making body shall find that the following criteria are met: 
a.  The proposed alternative design achieves the intent of the subject design standard to the same or better degree than the subject standard. 
b.  The proposed alternative design achieves the goals and policies of the Laramie comprehensive plan to the same or better degree than the subject standard. 
c.  The proposed alternative design results in benefits to the community that are equivalent to or better than compliance with the subject design standard. 
d.  The proposed alternative is in the same development standard category as the standard for which the alternative is proposed, i.e., alternative screening substituted for required screening, or alternative parking lot design substituted for required parking lot design. 
e.  The required improvement would be ineffective because of locational, topographic, or site constraints while the alternative design can accommodate site-specific issues. 
7.  Effect of Approval. Alternative compliance shall apply only to the specific site for which it is requested and does not establish a precedent for assured approval of other requests.

Figure 15.08-11: Image of development in the NB district. 
1.  Purpose. The NB district is designed to protect established residential neighborhoods and to provide for retail and service establishments that supply commodities or perform services to meet the daily needs of the adjacent residential neighborhood. The development standards of this district are established to promote the integration of these areas into the adjacent residential neighborhood so that residential property values will be preserved and potential conflicts minimized. 
2.  District-Specific Standards. 
a.  Restrictions on Use. Uses shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations to preserve and enhance desirable neighborhood qualities. 
(i)  Multiple Uses. Any number of permitted uses may be allowed on a single lot/development pad provided all buildings/structures are approved and all property development standards are met. The specific use of some lots/development pads or buildings may be limited based on access, parking limitations, or potential impacts to adjacent residential uses. 
(ii)  Development Pads. Sites may be developed with development pads platted as lots. 
(iii)  Condominiums and Townhomes. Condominiums and townhomes are permitted and may be developed on lots or in a development. 
(iv)  Storage Uses. Storage shall be limited to accessory storage of commodities sold at retail on the premises. All storage shall be completely enclosed within a building unless otherwise approved by the city manager's office. 
(v)  Walls Between Use Districts. A six-foot high solid masonry wall shall be constructed and maintained on all property lines which abut a residential use or zone district unless the NB property is separated from the residential use or zone district by a public road. Walls may be required to be set back from streets and alleys so as not to obstruct views. 
(vi)  Hours of Operation. No business shall be open to the public between the hours of eleven p.m. and six a.m. 
(vii)  Uses in Buildings. All uses shall be operated within an enclosed building. Limited seasonal outdoor displays and sales may be permitted pursuant to Section 15.10.020. 
b.  Property Development Standards. The following property development standards shall apply to all land and buildings in the NB district. 
(i)  Area and Minimum Lot Size. The minimum lot/development pad size shall be three thousand six hundred square feet. 
(ii)  Setbacks. Setbacks shall be established by Chapter 15.12, Dimensional Standards. Generally, setbacks from the street shall be minimized, but should be adequate to provide for the required landscaping. Setbacks may be varied throughout the site. Proposed setback lines shall be shown on the site plan. All buildings shall meet the following setback requirements. 
(1)  Setback From Residential Zone District. All commercial buildings shall be setback a minimum of twenty feet from any residential zone district line. 
(2)  Utility Easements. Utility easements, when located in the front landscape strip, shall be in addition to the minimum required landscape area and setback unless the utility agrees to allow the placement of the landscape materials (i.e., trees and shrubs) required by subsection 15.08.030.B.2.f. within the utility easement. 
(3)  Projections Over Sidewalks. Awnings, colonnades, and similar architectural features may extend five feet over a sidewalk, provided they do not block pedestrian access. All projection over a sidewalk shall provide a minimum of seven feet of vertical clearance. 
(iii)  Development Standards. The provisions of Chapter 15.14 Development Standards shall apply to development in an NB district unless changed by the standards included in this section. 
(iv)  Restrictions on Upper Floor Residential Use. Residential uses are allowed on upper floors above commercial or entertainment uses on the ground floor subject to the setbacks and height limitations stipulated in this code. In addition, the following standards shall apply:

(3)  Parking areas for upper floor residential uses shall be accessed from the same driveway as the commercial parking area. 
c.  Building Design. All buildings designed for or intended to be occupied by a non-residential use shall meet the following requirements: 
(i)  Building Height. No building shall exceed thirty-five feet in height. Where building heights exceed thirty feet, the building height of at least fifty percent of the building area on the lot shall not exceed eighteen feet for flat-roofed buildings and twenty-four feet for buildings with pitched roofs. Where residential units have been incorporated into the development plan, the city manager's office may allow up to eighty percent of the building area to exceed eighteen feet in height. 
C.  Limited Business (B1) District. 

Figure 15.08-12: Image of typical development in the B1 district. 
1.  Purpose. The B1 district is intended for retail and office uses. The district includes retail centers that provide shopping service to surrounding neighborhoods and the community. Commercial uses that would not be compatible with surrounding residential areas are prohibited or subject to special restrictions. This district is intended to accommodate commercial development on a smaller scale than that in the B2 district with a more narrow range of allowed uses. 
a.  Mini Storage Facilities. Mini storage facilities that are architecturally compatible with the surrounding development shall be allowed by conditional use permit. The decision-making authority shall consider and determine the architectural compatibility of the proposed mini storage facility. If a facility abuts a residentially zoned property or residential development, the mini storage structure shall have a sloped roof, relief features, exterior materials, and colors consistent with nearby residential construction.

Figure 15.08-14: Images of Downtown Laramie. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of the DC district is to preserve, enhance, and promote Laramie's historic downtown area as a nucleus of community activity. Additionally, the district is designed to allow for a wide variety of retail, entertainment, finance, and office uses, as well as a mix of uses including multifamily, while maintaining the historic character and scale of the area. 
The DC district standards require compliance with the Design Guidelines for Historic Downtown Laramie ("design guidelines") where the design guidelines apply. Copies of the design guidelines are available from the community development department or the city's website. In the event of a conflict between the design guidelines and these district-specific standards, the design guidelines shall take precedence. The design guidelines for historic downtown Laramie and the process to apply them are hereby incorporated by reference. 
In areas of the DC district outside the boundaries where the design guidelines for historic downtown Laramie apply, the design standards in this section apply. In many cases, these standards require new development and redevelopment to be similar in scale and character to those of other uses and structures nearby, rather than setting a single standard for the entire DC area. 
2.  District-Specific Standards. 
a.  Permitted Uses. Permitted and conditional uses for the DC district are those set forth in table 15.10-1. 
b.  Dimensional Standards. Dimensional requirements for lots and structures in the DC district are set forth in table 15.12-3, except as supplemented below. 
(i)  Front Setbacks and Build-To Lines. The front setback of each primary structure in the DC district shall meet the front setback requirements of the Design Guidelines in the areas where they apply. In areas where the Design Guidelines do not apply, the front setback of the primary structure shall be one of the following, as applicable. The minimum setbacks shown in table 15.12-3 do not apply in the DC district. 
(1)  If the entire width of the front façade of either of the adjacent buildings is built to the front property line, then the entire width of the front façade of the proposed building shall also be built to the front property line. (See Figure 15.08-15.) 
(2)  If part of the width of the front façade of either of the adjacent buildings is built to the front property line, then at least fifty percent of the width of the front façade of the proposed building shall also be built to the front property line. (See Figure 15.08-16.) 
(3)  If no part of the front façade of either of the adjacent buildings is built to the front property line, then the front façade of the proposed building shall be built no more than five feet further from the front property line than the front façade of the adjacent building nearest the street. (See Figure 15.08-17.) 
(4)  When the requirements of subsections (1), (2), or (3) above are applied to a building on a corner lot, they shall only require comparison with the front façade of the adjacent building facing the same street as the proposed building (not adjacent buildings that face different streets). 
(5)  If only one of the adjacent lots on the same block face is occupied with a primary structure, the requirements of subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) above shall only require comparison with the one adjacent lot that is occupied with a primary structure. If neither of the adjacent lots facing the same block face is occupied with a primary structure, then the requirements of subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) above shall require comparison with the nearest building located on the same block face and facing the same street. 

Figure 15.08-15: When the entire width of the front facade of either of the adjacent buildings is built to the front property line, the entire width of the proposed building shall also be built to the front property line. 

Figure 15.08-16: If part of the width of the front facade of either of the adjacent buildings is built to the front property line, then at least fifty percent of the width of the proposed building shall also be built to the front property line. 

Figure 15.08-17: If not part of the front facade of either of the adjacent buildings is built to the property line, then the front facade of the proposed building shall not be further than five feet from the front property line than the adjacent building nearest to the street. 
(ii)  Maximum and Minimum Building Heights. The height of each primary structure in the DC district shall meet the building height requirements of the Design Guidelines in the area where they apply. In areas where the Design Guidelines do not apply, the maximum and minimum height of primary structures shall meet the following standards, as applicable. The maximum building height shown on Table 15.12-3 does not apply in the DC district. 
(1)  No primary or accessory structure shall be taller than (a) the tallest building on the block face where the proposed building is located, or (b) 12 feet taller than the tallest building on the block across the street from the front façade of the proposed structure, whichever is less. (See Figure 15.08-18.) 

Figure 15.08-18: No primary structure may be taller than the tallest building on the block, or more than twelve feet taller than the tallest building on the block face across the street, whichever is less. 
c.  Development Standards. The following development standards shall supplement those contained in Chapter 15.14, Development Standards, within the DC district. Wherever possible, development in the DC district shall comply with both the standards in Chapter 15.14 and the standards in this section; however, in the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of Chapter 15.14 and the standards in this section, the standards in this section shall govern. 
(i)  Landscaping and Screening. The landscaping and screening standards in Section 15.14.050 shall apply in the DC district, except as set forth below. 
(1)  Landscaping. 
(a)  Site Perimeter Landscaping. Site perimeter landscaping along side or rear lot lines shall only be required when the lot lines occur between a residential and a nonresidential use of property. If the primary structure on either side of the lot line contains a mixed-use (i.e., a mix of residential and nonresidential uses) no site perimeter landscaping shall be required. Where site perimeter landscaping is required, the applicant may choose to substitute for any planting requirement an opaque fence or wall constructed of one of the primary materials used on the façade of the primary structure. If the applicant chooses to provide planted materials for any required site perimeter landscaping on a side or rear lot line, the required width of any planting area shall be reduced to four feet. 

Figure 15.08-20: Street trees within planting strips (left image) or in tree pits (right image) help to create a pedestrian-friendly environment. 
(b)  Building Perimeter Landscaping. Building perimeter landscaping shall not be required along the foundations of any primary structure. 
(c)  Landscaping Within the Right-of-Way. Landscaping may be installed within the "furnishings zone" as defined in the design guidelines in addition to the pedestrian amenities set forth below. However, where a sidewalk and planting strip exist on adjacent property, the new sidewalk and planting strip shall match the adjacent sidewalk and planting strip in configuration and alignment unless the city manager's office determines that, for the convenience of the public, a new configuration and alignment are preferable. 
(2)  Parking Lot Landscaping and Screening. Any boundary of a surface parking lot that abuts a public street or alley, or that abuts a lot used for detached residential dwellings, shall be landscaped according to this subsection. 
(a)  For corner-lot buildings with rear-yard parking, the boundary between the parking lot and the street-facing side property line shall be landscaped or screened adjacent to the right-of-way according to one of the following options: 
i.  A minimum four-foot-wide planting strip containing a low, continuous hedge a minimum of thirty inches tall at installation consisting of a double row of evergreen shrubs planted a minimum of three feet on-center in a triangular pattern; or 
ii.  A minimum two-foot-wide planting strip containing an ornamental metal fence or masonry wall, with a minimum height of three and one-half feet and a maximum height of four feet, combined with a single row of evergreen shrubs planted a minimum of three feet on-center. 
(b)  For all other parking lot boundaries, the boundary shall be landscaped or screened according to one of the following options: 
i.  A minimum two-foot-wide planting strip containing a single row of shrubs planted a minimum of three feet on-center combined with a minimum three-foot high ornamental metal fence or masonry wall of materials compatible with the primary structure. In the place of shrubs, deciduous shade trees may be planted a minimum of twenty feet on-center along the common boundary line; or 
ii.  A minimum four-foot-wide planting strip containing a low, continuous hedge a minimum of thirty inches tall at installation consisting of a double row of evergreen shrubs planted a minimum of three feet on-center in a triangular pattern. 
(c)  As applicable, landscaping materials shall be planted on the side of the fence/wall closest to the street, alley, or residential property. 
(d)  In addition to the landscaping standards stated in this subsection, see subsection 15.14.050.F. off-street parking lot landscaping, for applicable interior and perimeter parking-lot landscape requirements. 
i.  Parking lots containing fewer than fifteen spaces shall be exempt from requirements to provide interior landscaping. 
ii.  Parking lots containing fewer than fifteen spaces need not provide site perimeter landscaping along side or rear lot lines except where the parking lot is adjacent to a residential land use as set forth below in this subsection. Where site perimeter landscaping is required, the applicant may choose to substitute for any planting requirement a masonry wall constructed of material compatible with the primary materials used on the façade of the primary structure. If the applicant chooses to provide planted materials for any required site perimeter landscaping on a side or rear lot line, the required width of any planting area shall be reduced to four feet. 
(ii)  Parking and Loading. 
(1)  Commercial development within the DC district boundaries shall be exempt from the off-street parking standards of Section 15.14.040. 
(2)  For residential development within the DC district, the minimum off-street parking requirements of table 15.14.040-3 shall be reduced to seventy-five percent of the amount required in other zone districts. If the property is located within six hundred sixty feet of a public parking lot, the minimum off-street parking requirements shall be fifty percent of the amount shown in table 15.14.040-3.

Examples include heavy manufacturing, storage, major freight terminals, waste and salvage, large dairy operations, distribution centers, processing, and other related uses. Because of the objectionable influences that may be created in this district, a buffer or additional setback strip and other site design requirements are necessary around this district to protect other zoning districts, except the I1 Light Industrial district. 
2.  District-Specific Standards. 
a.  Mitigation of Impacts. All uses shall be subject to the following standards: 
(i)  Excessive amounts of dust, fumes, odors, smoke, vapor, noise, lights, and vibrations shall be confined within the I2 district (questions concerning the interpretation of "excessive amounts" shall be decided by the city manager's office based on the intent and purposes of this section); and 
K.  O District. 

Figure 15.08-27: Image of typical development in the O zone district. 
1.  Purpose. The O district is intended for low-impact non-residential and civic uses on large lots. Lands designated as O may be done in conformity with the comprehensive plan for the city to protect lands from premature development and to properly guide growth of the areas surrounding the city that are important for future urban development of the city. The O district is designed to function as a holding zone for future planning and development of agricultural lands without preference for any specific urban use. 
L.  Technology and Office (TO) District. 

Figure 15.080.030.L-1. Proposed development style within the TO district. 
1.  Purpose. The TO district is designed to provide for the development of a mix of office, research and production and technology uses with the emphasis on office, research uses and technology. The uses are to be grouped in a campus or park-like setting and should generally be performed or carried out primarily within a completely enclosed building. The district is further intended to promote perimeter landscaping for large-scale development and increased setbacks from sensitive development areas. The development standards of this district are established to promote the integration of these areas into the surrounding areas and preserve viewsheds from open space and trail corridors shown in the comprehensive plan. 
2.  District-Specific Standards. 
a.  Permissible Uses. Permitted and conditional uses for the TO district are those set forth in Table 15.10-1. 
b.  Dimensional Standards. Dimensional requirements for lots and structures in the TO district are set forth in Table 15.12-3, except as supplemented below. 
(i)  Maximum and Minimum Building Heights. The height of all structures in the TO district shall not exceed forty-five feet or as indicated in subsection 15.08.000.L.2.(ii) below. 

Figure 15.080.030.L-2a. Building heights shall not exceed one foot in height for every four feet of distance from a proposed or existing trail. 
(ii)  Height Restrictions from Trail Corridors. Building heights shall not exceed one foot in height for every four feet of distance from a proposed or existing trail as shown in the comprehensive plan. In instances where the trail has not been constructed, the city manager's office shall make a determination of its future location. Relief may be granted by the planning commission if the planning commission finds that the proposed development does not interfere with viewsheds, that adequate screening is provided, alternative mitigation measures have been proposed to mitigate visual impacts and the developer provides a visual simulations of the proposed development and its relationship to a trail corridor. 

Figure 15.080.030.L-2b. Building heights shall not exceed one foot in height for every four feet of distance from a proposed or existing trail. The above image shows that a twenty-foot-tall building would be required to be set back eighty feet from a trail centerline and thirty-five feet from a one-hundred-foot-wide open space corridor.

A.  Aquifer Protection (APO) Overlay. 
1.  Legislative Findings. More than half of the city of Laramie's municipal water supply and all of the drinking water supplied to Albany County rural residences comes from wells and springs in the Casper Aquifer. The delineated recharge area of the Casper Aquifer Protection Area (CAPA) encompasses approximately seventy-two square miles that lie east of the city of Laramie and extends to the crest of the Laramie Range. The north and south boundaries are approximately five and six miles north and south, respectively of Laramie's city limits. Approximately four hundred fifty Albany county residents and four city of Laramie municipal wellfields draw water from the Casper Aquifer in this area. The vast majority of the CAPA is the recharge area for the Casper Aquifer, and consequently, the Casper Aquifer is vulnerable to contamination from land uses in the CAPA. Exposure of the Casper Aquifer in the delineated area results in increased vulnerability to contamination from land uses. In addition to the general vulnerability of the Casper Aquifer in the area where aquifer materials are exposed at the surface, there are specific features that enhance the vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination. 
a.  Recharge into the Casper Aquifer system occurs rapidly as snowmelt and runoff infiltrates into porous sandstones and fractures that occur in drainages and on the land surface. 
b.  There is continuous residential and commercial development pressure east of Laramie where the Casper Aquifer is recharged. Development in this area increases the risk of contamination in two ways: 
(i)  New Contamination Sources. Homes and businesses are new sources of potential contamination to the aquifer (volatile organic compounds from fuels and solvents, nutrient fertilizers and pesticides from lawn care, nitrates and pathogens from septic leachate). 
(ii)  New Contamination Pathways. New wells and excavations which weaken the integrity of the confining layer may provide a direct conduit to the Casper Aquifer or reduce the hydraulic barrier provided by the Satanka Shale that overlies the Casper Aquifer. 
c.  An unknown quantity of hazardous substances is transported along Interstate 80 (I-80) and I-80 transects the Casper Aquifer recharge area. 
d.  There is the potential for the rapid transport of contaminants in the saturated zone due to a steep hydraulic gradient and enhanced aquifer permeability from fractures, joints, and dissolution features. 
e.  The recharge area of the Casper Aquifer is in close physical proximity to withdrawal points for Albany County and city of Laramie residents. 
The Laramie city council adopts this ordinance because the Casper Aquifer provides a critical component of the existing and future drinking water supply for city residents, especially in drought conditions. The importance of the groundwater supply component was demonstrated in the summer of 2002 when the Laramie River supply was reduced significantly due to drought and the city had to rely almost exclusively on groundwater. 
2.  Purpose and Intent. Inappropriate development over the Casper Aquifer can deteriorate the quality of the drinking water through the intentional or unintentional release of contaminants which is harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of residents. Therefore, the purpose and intent of this ordinance is to protect the high quality source water in the Casper Aquifer and to decrease the risk of contamination to the Casper Aquifer.

b.  Where the boundary line of the APO zone divides a lot or other parcel of land, the requirements established by this ordinance shall apply only to the portion of the lot or parcel that is located within the APO zone. 
c.  The establishment of the APO zone and the use of the APO zoned properties in accordance with this ordinance do not relieve any Person from liability provided by law for contamination of the Casper Aquifer. This ordinance does not supersede or modify the requirements of any federal law, state law, or local regulation that has more stringent requirements. 
d.  Where the bounds of the identified CAPA, as delineated, are in doubt or in dispute, any landowner aggrieved by such delineation may appeal the boundary location to the city planning commission. Upon receipt of a written appeal, the city planning commission shall suspend further action on development plans related to the area under appeal and shall engage, at the landowner's expense, a qualified hydrogeologist to prepare a report determining the proper location and extent of the Casper Aquifer and recharge area relative to the property in question. 
e.  Pursuant to W.S. 15-1-609, the decision of the planning commission may be reviewed by the district court in the same manner as provided in Rule 12 of the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure, for review of decisions of boards of adjustment. 
f.  Applications filed and accepted after the effective date of this ordinance shall meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
g.  Where this ordinance is less strict or where this ordinance is silent as to a particular issue, developments shall conform to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) in which the developments are located. 
5.  Groundwater Monitoring Program Implementation. The city of Laramie, in cooperation with Albany County, shall implement the groundwater monitoring program as described in the Casper Aquifer Protection Plan and Groundwater Monitoring Program.

(ii)  No vulnerable feature, as defined in subsection 15.08.040.A.7.a., exists within one hundred feet of the proposed development. 
(iii)  A site-specific investigation, as defined in subsection 15.08.040.A.8. has been performed for the property and a written report, including maps, of the site-specific investigation has been submitted to the city. 
(iv)  A professional engineer (the city engineer or other licensed professional engineer), geologist, hydrologist, or other qualified designee who, by experience and/or by training has the required skills in the areas of groundwater evaluation, geologic formation analysis, and the science of contaminant transport, other than the professional that performed the site-specific investigation, must review the site-specific investigation and verify that the proposed development meets the requirements of this ordinance. If review of the site-specific investigation is conducted by anyone other than the city engineer, the city may be reimbursed for the cost of the review. 
In review of the site-specific investigation, the qualified professional will assess and determine whether the site and development plans meet the overall objectives of the Casper Aquifer Protection Plan and this ordinance. 
b.  The city may attach conditions of approval to ensure the protection of the groundwater quality, including, but not limited to, further evaluation, reasonable technical improvements, monitoring or other mitigation measures. All conditions of approval shall be reviewed and evaluated by the professional engineer, geologist, hydrologist, or other qualified designee who reviews the site-specific investigation to ensure that the condition(s) of approval are of sound scientific and technical reasoning. 
10.  Design Standards for On-Site Wastewater Treatment System/Septic Systems. 
a.  No new septic systems shall be permitted within the APO zone. 
b.  Installation, design, repair, and removal of septic systems located within the APO zone must be in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by and certified by a professional engineer skilled in the science of wastewater disposal and licensed to practice in the state of Wyoming. This ordinance does not grant the right to install a septic system or on-site wastewater treatment system otherwise forbidden by city regulations. 
c.  Each existing septic system shall be pumped to prevent solids, oils, and grease from building up to a level in the tank where these materials will begin washing out to the leach field and clogging the field lines. Pumping shall occur not less than every five years or on a schedule as otherwise recommended by a city licensed wastewater system pumper/hauler. A database regarding the septic systems and their pumping and inspection schedules will be maintained and updated by the city GIS to maintain records and track schedules, which information shall be made available to the county. 
d.  Each existing septic system and leach field within the APO shall be inspected by the city engineer or other city qualified designee skilled in the science of wastewater disposal: 
(i)  During installation of replacement system, before backfilling; and 
(ii)  At least once every three years. 
e.  If upon inspection a septic system is found to be inadequately designed or constructed to serve the use for which it is intended, without undue risk to the Casper Aquifer, it shall not be used for the disposal of wastewater until it is cleaned, repaired or otherwise made to operate properly or replaced. 
11.  Connection to Municipal or District Sewage Collection Lines. 
a.  For properties within the APO zone no private on-site wastewater treatment system may be used after the earlier of: 
(i)  One year after installation of a municipal sewer collection line in a right of way or easement that is contiguous to the property on which the system is location; or 
(ii)  One year after the inclusion of the property containing the on-site system in a district connected to the city of Laramie's wastewater treatment system or another wastewater treatment facility and if the sewage collection line is in a right of way or easement that is contiguous to the property. 
b.  This section shall be consistent with the provisions within the existing city of Laramie-Albany County 201 Wastewater Agreement. If there is a disagreement between this ordinance and the 201 Wastewater Agreement, the stricter of the two shall apply. 
12.  Pre-Existing Nonconforming Uses. Pre-existing nonconforming uses within the APO zone are subject to the terms of this ordinance and to other general ordinance provisions on pre-existing nonconforming uses. 
a.  A pre-existing nonconforming use is a use prohibited by this regulation but which is in place upon property included in the APO zone as of the date the property was included in the APO zone. That date may be the effective date of this ordinance or the date a use becomes nonconforming because of an amendment to this ordinance. Septic systems and other on-site wastewater treatment systems are controlled by this ordinance and are not subject to these provisions on pre-existing nonconforming uses. 
b.  Pre-existing nonconforming uses may continue in the same location they were in when they became nonconforming uses, but shall not be expanded in size or scope. Any nonconforming use or structure which is damaged by less than 50% of its replacement value may be allowed by the city manager's office to continue or be reconstructed. Any nonconforming use or structure damaged by more than fifty percent of its replacement value may continue or be reconstructed if approved by the city council. If a nonconforming use or structure is allowed to continue or be reconstructed it shall be in the same location, size, and scope, provided that after repairs are complete, the best available control technology shall be in place to prevent contact between hazardous materials and the surface of the ground or groundwater. 
c.  A pre-existing nonconforming use may be expanded under these conditions. 
(i)  All provisions in subsection 15.08.040.A.8. and subsection 15.08.040.A.9. are met. 
(ii)  The expansion does not increase the risk of contamination of the Casper Aquifer. 
(iii)  Control technology built in to the expansion will prevent any increased risk to the Casper Aquifer because: 
(1)  Substitution is made of one hazardous material for another provided the substituted material is used for the same function and in equal or lesser amounts as the original material; 
(2)  Substitution of equipment or process for equipment or process provided that the substituted equipment or process performs the same function as the original equipment or process, without increasing the storage volume of hazardous materials stored at the subject business or facility; 
(3)  Expansion of wholesale or retail sales volume which increases the use of hazardous materials but which does not increase the storage capacity for hazardous material; and 
(4)  Initiation at the subject facility or business of an activity that is not a prohibited activity. 
d.  Every pre-existing nonconforming use shall: 
(i)  Store hazardous material in an enclosed structure or under a roof which eliminates stormwater entry to the containment area; 
(ii)  Provide floors within a structure where hazardous material is stored, coated to protect the surface of the floor from deterioration due to spillage of any such material. A structure which may be used for storage or transfer of hazardous material shall be protected from stormwater run-on and ground water intrusion; 
(iii)  Store hazardous material within an enclosed impermeable containment area which is capable of containing at least the volume of the largest container of such hazardous material present in the area or one hundred ten percent of the total volume of all such containers in the area, whichever is larger, without overflow of released hazardous material from the containment area; 
(iv)  Store hazardous material in a manner that will prevent the contact of chemicals with any materials so as to create a hazard of fire, explosion or generation of toxic substances; 
(v)  Store hazardous materials only in containers that have been certified by a state or federal agency or the American Society of Testing Materials as suitable for the transport or storage of the material; 
(vi)  Store all hazardous material in an area secured against entry by the public, except items offered for retail sale in their original unopened containers; 
(vii)  Not use, maintain or install floor drains, dry wells or other infiltration devices or appurtenances which allow the release of wastewater to the ground water; and 
(viii)  Not discharge any substance or material to the ground in the APO zone unless the discharge is permitted by law. 
e.  These requirements are intended to supplement, and not to supersede, any other applicable requirements of federal, state or local law. 
13.  Proper Plugging and Abandonment of Unused Wells. All wells, including but not limited to groundwater pumping wells and monitoring wells, that are no longer in use by the owner must be properly plugged and abandoned in accordance with Chapter 11, Section 70, Part G of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality Rules and Regulations. 
14.  Exception From One-Hundred-feet Setback from Vulnerable Features for Infrastructure. The construction of sewer and water lines that are attached to either a centralized wastewater or water system or the city of Laramie's Wastewater or Water system, may be installed within the APO in order to protect water quality. Sewer lines shall be engineered in such a way as to limit the possibility of an undetected leak; this may include double walled pipes and regular pressure testing or other engineering techniques and leak detection systems that reduce the possibility of undetected leaks. Exceptions also include other general utilities used specifically to serve local developments such as electric lines, gas lines for heating, cable television, and telephone lines. Roads may also be excepted if appropriate stormwater drainage and management is included. 
15.  Existing Law on Aquifer Contamination Unaffected. The establishment of the APO zone, and the use of APO-zoned properties in accord with this ordinance, does not relieve any Person from liability provided by law for contamination of the Casper Aquifer. This ordinance does not supersede or modify the requirements of any federal, state or local law which makes stricter requirements. 
16.  Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are severable. If any provision is declared to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, those provisions not so declared shall remain in effect.

h.  Improve the design, quality, and character of new development. 
2.  District-Specific Standards. A planned unit development shall be consistent with the statement of purpose for planned unit development and the following criteria: 
a.  Minimum Acreage. The minimum acreage for a planned unit development site is five acres, except that it may be reduced to two acres if department determines that a smaller site size will encourage development in conformance with the comprehensive plan. Other properties eligible for minimum PUD size reduction to two acres shall be located in the following specified areas: 
(i)  The Downtown Commercial district; and 
(ii)  Infill development areas. 
b.  Density. 
(i)  The maximum density shall be based on the applicable base zoning designation as follows: 
TABLE 15.08-3: PUD Density Standards 
Base Zone District Maximum Density RR 3 residential units per gross acre LR 5 residential units per gross acre R1 8 residential units per gross acre R2, R2M 12 residential units per gross acre R3, NB, B1, B2, DC 44 residential units per gross acre  
(ii)  The maximum gross density of the PUD shall be based on the zone in which it is located. Actual gross density shall be computed by dividing the total acreage of the planned unit development by the number of dwelling units. The density for portions of the PUD may exceed the maximum gross density for the underlying zone as long as the maximum gross density for the entire PUD does not exceed the maximum gross density allowed in that zone. The net density of a particular phase of the PUD shall be computed by dividing the acreage of the phase by the number of dwelling units. The total acreage shall be that area contained in the planned development application and include all proposed streets, common areas, public parks, dwelling sites, and similar areas within the proposed development. When such computation ends with more than 0.5 of a dwelling unit, the maximum density will be increased to the next whole number. 
(iii)  Density bonuses may be awarded as set forth in subsection 15.08.040.C.2.g. 
c.  Common Areas. Before final PUD approval, the developer shall specify the manner of holding title to common areas or facilities of joint use. Such areas and facilities shall be retained in title by the developers of the planned unit development or deeded to an organization composed of all owners in the development. The method used by the developer shall be subject to approval by the city attorney. Common areas may be offered for dedication to the city. The city council may accept the offer of any or all portions of the common areas being offered pursuant to subsection 15.080.040.C.2.h(ii)(2) and may approve a development agreement which specifies terms and conditions for accepting the common areas. Common areas may be offered for dedication to the city. The city council may accept the offer of any or all portions of the common areas being offered pursuant to subsection 15.080.040.C.2.h(ii)(2) and may approve a development agreement which specifies terms and conditions for accepting the common areas.

(f)  The governing board of any such association shall consist of at least five members who shall be owners of property in the PUD Overlay district. 
(2)  If the entity established to own and maintain the common open space and recreation areas or any successor entity shall at any time fail to fulfill any obligation imposed on such entity as a condition of approval of the planned unit development, the city may give written notice to the entity or to the residents and owners of the planned unit development or both, setting forth the manner in which the entity has failed to fulfill its obligation. The notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies be cured within the time specified within the notice. If such deficiencies are not cured within the specified time, the city, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned unit development and to prevent the common open space and recreation areas from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and recreation areas and maintain the same and perform the other duties of the entity until the entity shall again resume its obligations. All costs incurred by the city in carrying out the obligations of the entity shall be assessed against the properties within the Planned Unit Development Overlay district and shall become a tax lien on the properties; 
(3)  Open space shown on the approved final PUD plan shall not be used for the construction of any structures not in conformance with the PUD Overlay district. 
(iv)  Access. 
(1)  PUDs shall comply with the transportation, mobility and connectivity standards of LMC Section 15.14.060, Transportation, Mobility and Connectivity; and 
(2)  Each PUD greater than fifteen acres shall have at least two direct accesses to a collector or arterial street as designated on the major street and highway plan. No individual residential building lot shall be created that has direct access to a collector or arterial street. Each individual residential lot must have access to a street, public or private, that has been constructed to the public street standards of the city. 
(v)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks built to city specifications shall be required along both sides of all streets, public or private. 
(vi)  Building Requirements. 
(1)  The maximum building height shall be the same as for the zone district in which the PUD is located, except that a greater height may be approved if surrounding open space within the PUD, building setbacks, and other design features are used to avoid any adverse impact due to the greater height; and 
(2)  The front of a dwelling structure shall not face upon the rear of another, unless approved by the city council as part of the PUD Overlay district. 
(vii)  Landscaping.

The front of the building with the primary entry shall face the public street on which it is located. 
(2)  Parking Lots for Buildings Smaller than Fifteen Thousand Square Feet. Parking lots in the front of buildings smaller than fifteen thousand square feet GFA shall be limited to one double-loaded bay. The remainder of the required off-street parking shall be located on the side or in the rear of the building. 
(3)  Parking Groups. The total number of required parking spaces shall be divided into smaller groups of parking, with no more than forty parking spaces per parking group. (See Figure 15.08-31) 
(a)  Parking groups shall be separated from each other by a landscaped area no less than ten feet wide. 
(b)  Each parking group shall be separated from principal buildings and any street or drive by a landscaped buffer area. The landscape area shall have a minimum width of thirty feet when adjacent to public streets and ten feet when adjacent to internal drives. 
(iii)  Building Design Standards. The building design standards in Section 15.14.090 shall apply in the Gateway Overlay district except as follows. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this subsection (iv) and any provision of Section 15.14.090, the provisions of this subsection (iv) shall govern. 
(1)  Entryway Design and Location. Each principal building must have clearly defined, highly visible main entrances for occupants and/or customers and secondary entrances that provide access to side and rear parking. Main entrances shall be designed with features that emphasize the importance of the entrance, which must include at least two of the following options, with the choice of the features to be at the option of the owner: 
(a)  A canopy or portico; 
(b)  A roof overhang; 
(c)  A horizontal recess or projection; 
(d)  An arcade or arch; 
(e)  A peaked roof form; 
(f)  An outside patio; 
(g)  A display window; 
(h)  Architectural tilework or moldings integrated into the building design; 
(i)  Integrated planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas or seating areas; or 
(j)  Another architectural feature not found on the remainder of that building façade. 
(iv)  Fences and Walls. The fence and wall provisions of Section 15.14.100 shall apply in the Gateway Overlay district, except that no wall or fence of any type may be constructed to enclose any area between the front façade of the primary structure and the street frontage. 
(v)  [Signs.] Unless located within the I-80 Corridor Overlay district, as defined in subsection 15.14.120.E.2.a of this title, all signs permitted shall be monument signs (i.e., the lower edge of the sign is attached to a foundation with no visible air space in between the lower edge of the sign face and the foundation) following the effective date of this ordinance. Monument signs shall be constructed of materials similar to or which are compatible in quality and appearance with the primary materials used on primary buildings on the site. The addition of skirting between the lower edge of the sign face and the foundation of a pole sign, in order to avoid visible air space between the two, is not permitted. Monument signs shall not exceed ten feet in height above street grade. The maximum sign face of a monument sign shall be eighty square feet. If the monument sign is oriented approximately perpendicular to the street frontage, or if it is located diagonally on a corner lot in order to be seen from two streets, it may contain a sign face of up to eighty square feet on each of its two sign faces. Maximum sign areas shall apply to each lot or parcel, and not per street frontage or per user. 

Figure 15.08-34: All freestanding signs shall be monument style in the Gateway Overlay district. 
E.  Residential Overlay for Business Districts (ROB). 
1.  Intent. Permitted uses in the B1 (Limited Business), B2 (Business), C2 (Commercial) and DC (Downtown Commercial) districts do not include residential uses. However, in recognition that residential and business uses can be compatible in specific locations and under specific criteria, an overlay district to allow this coexistence in B1, B2, C2 and DC districts is hereby established. The Residential Overlay for Business (ROB) district's intent is both to allow current development of this type to continue in particular situations and to allow limited new development as deemed appropriate. 
The Residential Overlay for Business (ROB) district is designed for zoning-map adoption primarily upon request by property owners who wish to perpetuate or create the mixed-use circumstances for which it is intended. The city may also initiate ROB zoning for these reasons as situations may warrant from time to time. 
Developmental standards for the ROB district are intended essentially to be a blending of the underlying B1, B2, C2 or DC standards with those in the city's highest-intensity residential base zoning district - namely, R3 (Multiple-Family). This intent reflects the fact that development impacts in these districts are relatively similar in scale, and that in much of the city, R3 is geographically the closest residential district to most B1, B2, C2 and DC districts. 
2.  Location. The ROB overlay zone district shall be as illustrated on Maps 15.08.060-9, 15.08.060-10, 15.08.060-11, and 15.08.060-12, located in subsection 15.08.060.C. The overlay zone district may be expanded from time-to-time. 
3.  Applicability. The Residential Overlay for Business (ROB) district shall be available for application to areas with B1 (Limited Business), B2 (Business), C2 (Commercial) or DC (Downtown Commercial) district zoning. Any ordinance that rezones ROB-overlaid property to a base zoning district other than B1, B2, C2 or DC shall have the effect of terminating the ROB overlay zoning for that property. Any property newly zoned to the B1, B2, C2 or DC district shall be eligible for ROB zoning upon specific request, provided all appropriate criteria are found to be satisfactory in the course of rezoning. 
4.  District Specific Standards. 
a.  Non-Residential Properties-Generally. Except as otherwise specified in this section, properties zoned ROB whose existing or proposed principal use is non-residential shall retain all underlying permitted uses, conditional uses (duly approved), dimensional standards, and development standards as the underlying B1, B2, C2 or DC district. 
b.  Residential Properties-B1, B2 or C2 District with ROB Overlay. Except as otherwise specified in this section, properties zoned B1, B2, or C2 with ROB Overlay whose existing or proposed principal use is residential shall be subject to the R3 (Multiple-Family) regulations concerning permitted uses, conditional uses (duly approved), dimensional standards, and development standards. 
c.  Residential Properties-DC District with ROB Overlay. Except as otherwise specified in this section, properties zoned DC with ROB Overlay whose existing or proposed principal use is residential shall be subject to the following standards: 
(i)  Permitted Uses: All uses permitted in the R3 district or the DC district; 
(ii)  Conditional Uses: All duly approved conditional uses in either the DC or R3 districts; 
(iii)  Dimensional Standards: Dimensional standards in either the DC or R3 district, whichever standard may be less restrictive for a given property; 
(iv)  Development Standards: Development Standards in either the DC or R3 district, whichever standard may be less restrictive for a given property. 
d.  Properties with Both Residential and Non-Residential Uses. A property zoned ROB may be used for residential and non-residential uses at the same time, provided that the following shall apply: 
(i)  Permitted Uses: All permitted uses in the underlying business zoning district (B1,B2, C2 or DC) or in the R3 district shall be permitted; 
(ii)  Conditional Uses: All conditional uses in the underlying business zoning district (B1, B2, C2 or DC) or in the R3 district shall be permitted, provided the conditional use is duly approved as required in this title; 
(iii)  Dimensional Standards: The dimensional standards for the R3 district as specified in Chapter 15.12 shall apply; provided, however, that in the case of a property zoned DC with ROB Overlay, the dimensional standards for either DC district or R3 district shall apply, whichever standard may be less restrictive for a given property; 
(iv)  Development Standards: The development standards for the underlying business zoning district (B1, B2, C2 or DC) shall apply; provided, however, that in the case of a property zoned DC with ROB Overlay, the development standards for either DC district or R3 district shall apply, whichever standard may be less restrictive for a given property; 
(v)  Conflicts in Permitted vs. Conditional Uses: For any ROB-zoned property on which both residential and non-residential uses exist or are proposed, and for which the uses in (i) and (ii) are allowed under different procedures - e.g., a use is permitted in B1, but is a conditional use in R3 - such use shall be reviewed and approved as a conditional use. 
(vi)  Proportional Allocation of Developmental Standards: For those development standards for which it is feasible and logical to allocate standards to each individual use on the property, such standards shall be applied proportionally. For example, required parking (15.14.040) may be allocated within the same parking area based on the residential (e.g., per bedroom) and non-residential (e.g., per gross floor area) standards. In cases in which the developmental standard cannot be allocated proportionally, the less restrictive standard shall control.

15.08.050 - Aviation influence area (AIA). 
A.  Purpose and Intent. This section is intended to minimize exposure of residential and other land uses to aircraft noise, to minimize the risks to public safety, to minimize hazards to aviation users and those employed or residing in proximity to public aviation facilities, and to promote sound land use planning and zoning practices on lands influenced by aviation operations. In consideration of the hazards to aircraft of uncontrolled land use in proximity to public aviation facilities, and in consideration of the noise, fumes, and other negative impacts of low-flying aircraft, and furthermore, in consideration that these influences and impacts vary in accordance with the proximity to runways, this section establishes a hierarchy of restrictions and zone districts dependent upon location of the land in relation to the aviation facility. In accordance with the potential hazards, these zone districts impose the strictest restrictions on land located closest to the aviation facility, and are less restrictive farther from the facility. 
B.  Applicability. This section shall apply to all land within the city and unincorporated portions of Albany County located within the designated aviation influence area and any specific zone district surrounding public aviation facilities and heliports regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration. If a portion of a lot, parcel, or tract lies within the AIA, or one of the zone districts described herein, these restrictions upon uses and structures apply to that portion of the lot, parcel, or tract located within the zone district. For ease of enforcement, restriction area boundaries shall be drawn to the nearest quarter section of land lying outside the AIA. These areas are particularly described on the official zone district map, as amended, and are filed at the office of the city clerk. 
    This section applies to the excavation for, erection of, and construction of new buildings or structures, and to the use of land. It also applies to the reconstruction, remodeling, or change of use of a building or structure; movement or relocation of a building or structure to a new site or location; and to the addition or expansion of an existing building or structure. 
C.  Exceptions. This section does not apply to lawfully constructed buildings, structures, and uses of land in existence on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. The nonconforming provisions of chapter 15.22, Nonconformities, shall apply except as noted hereafter in this section. 
D.  Relationship to Other Ordinances. The AIA establishes a series of zone districts that identify permitted and conditional uses on lands located near an aviation facility. The zone districts further establish design and performance standards for the use of lands within an airport influence area. 
    The aviation influence area and the associated zone districts shall be administered as a supplemental regulation on zoned land, including planned unit developments, when the land is located in proximity to public airports or heliports. Where land lies within one or more overlay zone districts, all land use restrictions associated with the underlying zone are in full force and effect, and the AIA overlay districts impose additional restrictions on those of the underlying zone. In the case of overlapping or conflicting requirements, the most restrictive provisions shall apply. 
E.  Establishment of Aviation Influence Area Zone Districts. The following zone districts are established to regulate lands within the aviation influence area: 
1.  Aviation zone district; 
2.  Airport enterprise zone district; 
3.  Noise overlay zone district; and 
4.  Height overlay zone district. 
F.  District-Specific Standards. 
1.  Boundaries. This section restricts the uses allowed on lands containing aviation facilities, and the uses of land surrounding aviation facilities. The boundaries of each are determined as cited below: 
a.  Aviation Zone (AV). The boundaries of the aviation zone shall, at a minimum, encompass runways, clear zones, aprons, aviation related structures including terminals and hangars, and other aviation-related services and support facilities as depicted on the approved airport layout plan (or airport master plan). The size of the area may vary according to the type of aviation facility. The city council establishes the official boundary of the aviation zone at the time the aviation facility is zoned. Changes in the size of the aviation zone are reviewed through the rezoning process in subsection 15.06.060.B. of this code. 
b.  Airport Enterprise Zone (AE). The boundaries of any airport enterprise zone shall be established by the city council. Changes in the size of the airport enterprise zone are reviewed through rezoning process in subsection 15.06.060.B. of this code. Generally, an airport enterprise zone shall be located adjacent to an aviation facility. 
c.  AIA Overlay Districts. The limit of the AIA overlay districts is the AIA boundary. This boundary shall at a minimum encompass the limits of the aviation zone and the noise and height overlays described herein, but may be larger in order to fulfill the purpose and intent of this section. The boundary of the AIA overlay zone districts shall be determined as outlined below after a hearing concerning the rezoning held for the establishment of zoning for the aviation facility by the city council. Changes in the size of the AIA overlay zone districts are reviewed through the rezoning process in subsection 15.06.060.B. of this code. 
d.  Noise Overlay District. This area includes all land heavily impacted by the noise created by low-flying aircraft. The geographic extent of the noise overlay for each aviation facility affecting the city will be drawn to the nearest quarter-section of land lying outside the noise overlay. The extent of this area shall be based upon a determination of the city manager's office or board of directors of the aviation facility, where due to the predominant flight patterns residents and workers are likely to be disturbed by the noise associated with aircraft. At a minimum, the noise overlay zone district shall contain all areas within the sixty Ldn contour based upon the measurements of sound computed by the methods contained in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter I, Federal Aviation Regulations (F.A.R., hereafter) Part 150, "Airport Noise Compatibility Planning." These computations shall be based upon the fleet mix that forms the "worst case scenario" for the type and volume of aircraft activity proposed at full build-out of the facility. The district boundaries may exceed those established using Part 150. 
(i)  Height Overlay Zone District. This area includes all land where the height of structures or natural features may obstruct or otherwise influence aviation activities. The extent of this area is determined by applying the standards and criteria listed in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter E, F.A.R. Part 77 entitled "Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace". The geographic extent of the height overlay for each aviation facility affecting the city will be drawn to the nearest quarter section of land lying outside the height overlay zone district. 
2.  Compliance. No structure or land within the boundaries of the AIA shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted in use, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. Administration and enforcement of these provisions shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of this section and Wyoming Statutes. 
3.  Severability. If any of the provisions of this section or the application thereof to any person, entity, or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions for applications of the section. 
4.  Permitted Uses - AV and AE Zone Districts. Table 15.08-4 lists the uses allowed within the AV and AE zoning districts. Approval of a use listed in Table 15.08-4, and compliance with the applicable use-specific standards for that use, authorizes that use only. 
Explanation of Table Abbreviations: 
(i)  Permitted By-Right Uses. "P" in a cell indicates that the use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this code, including the use-specific standards in this chapter and the requirements of Chapter 15.14, Development Standards. 
(ii)  Prohibited Uses. Development or use of a property for any other use not specifically allowed in table 15.08-1 and approved under the appropriate process is prohibited. Additionally, a blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective overlay zoning district

5.  Aviation Zone (AV) District. This area is devoted to those nonresidential land uses most directly associated with aviation operations. Allowed uses must adhere to the performance standards listed below. Adherence to these standards will be determined by the city manager. This determination will be based upon a description of the uses of the land, and of any proposed buildings or structures. The aviation facility manager shall approve all proposed uses within an aviation zone district. 
a.  General Requirements. The following requirements are applied in conjunction with the noise and height overlay restrictions itemized in this section, as well as those requirements specified by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(i)  Fencing. A perimeter fence at least sixty inches in height shall be erected to surround the aviation zone or aviation facility, whichever is smaller. 
(ii)  Roads. No new road or trail may be closer than two thousand seven hundred feet from the end of any runway as projected from the end of the runway if extended in a straight line except those necessary for aviation facility operations. 
(iii)  Interference. Uses may not interfere with airport operations, nor interfere with aerial approaches. 
b.  Restrictions on Uses. 
(i)  Accessory Outside Storage of Non-Hazardous Materials. Accessory outside storage of non-hazardous materials shall not exceed ten percent of the building area. 
c.  Performance Standards. Aviation related manufacturing and distribution uses that meet the following performance standards as determined by the city manager shall be allowed in the AV zone district, provided: 
(i)  The activity does not involve the generation or storage of animal, vegetable, or other wastes that attract insects, rodents, or birds, or otherwise creates a hazard to aircraft operations; 
(ii)  The activity does not emit smoke, fly ash, dust, vapor, gases, or other forms of air pollution that would interfere with the safe operation of aircraft, or that may conflict with present or planned operations of the airport; 
(iii)  The activity does not involve water impoundments, solid waste disposal, or other uses which attract birds or other animal species that may present a hazard to aircraft operations; 
(iv)  The activity does not emit glaring light or employ highly reflective surfaces that interfere with a pilot's ability to locate runways or landing pads; 
(v)  The activity does not create electronic interference with communications among aviators and ground control personnel; and 
(vi)  Accessory storage is enclosed and concealed by a minimum six-foot-high closed fence that prevents views of the interior. Screen fencing shall be maintained in an attractive condition. Fencing material shall be approved in advance by the city manager so as to be attractive to the area. Accessory outside storage shall not exceed the height of the fence, except for operable vehicles, trailers, and other equipment designed to be towed or lifted as a single component. 
d.  Other Uses Permitted. Other nonresidential uses may be permitted as determined by the city manager that directly depend and associate with aviation operations. 
e.  Excluded Uses. All uses not specifically permitted or determined by the city manager or to be permitted are excluded from the aviation zone district. 
f.  Off-Street Parking. The provisions of Section 15.14.040 shall apply. 
g.  Signs. The provisions of Section 15.14.120 shall apply. 
h.  Landscaping. The provisions of Section 15.14.050 shall apply. 
1.  Exceptions: 
a.  Site perimeter requirements for lots and parcels in the DC District shall be required pursuant to subsection 15.08.030.E.2.C, Development Standards. 
b.  Site perimeter requirements may be reduced up to one hundred percent for projects on lots and parcels allowing setbacks less than the required site perimeter yard width through the Alternative Equivalent Compliance requirements of subsection 5.06.060.K. Reductions shall only apply to lots and parcels where the primary building setback is less than the specific required perimeter landscaping width as shown in Table 15.14.050.A. Reductions shall only apply to specific required site perimeter areas between the property line and proposed principal building. A zero side setback requirement shall not be construed to allow a reduced rear yard setback. 
As part of alternative equivalent compliance review, the city may consider landscaping in the adjacent public right-of-way as a substitution for some or all of the required onsite street frontage landscaping, where in the opinion of the city manager's office the proposed public right-of-way landscaping meets the intent of this chapter. Any property owner requesting to landscape the public right-of-way as an alternative shall be required to maintain the landscaping into perpetuity unless the landscaped area is accepted for maintenance by the city. In addition to substituting for street frontage landscaping, public right-of-way landscaping may be substituted for other required landscaping If approved by the city manager's office. This may include the landscaping of public right-of-way or public lands within the city on a separate unrelated site in some cases where in the opinion of the city manager's office the public landscaping proposed will have significantly greater community benefit. 
For all uses located within the AV zoning district, landscaping requirements shall follow the requirements outlined below. No perimeter landscaping is required that would be subject to 15.14.050.F - Site Perimeter landscaping, and Table 15.14.050-2: Applicability of Site Perimeter Landscaping. 
(i)  Ten landscaping units shall be required for each one thousand square feel of development area, including the building, parking or any other area necessary for the operation of the development proposed and as depicted in the Site Plan Application. 
(ii)  All units shall be awarded based upon Table 15.14.050-4: Landscaped Units Awarded, and all other standards set forth in 15.14.050, Landscaping and Screening Standards shall be required. 
(iii)  All required landscaping shall be planted on the proposed property, or on property owned by the same individual or individuals as the AV Zoned property and shall be within the AV or AE Zoning District. 
6.  Airport Enterprise Zone (AE) District. The airport enterprise (AE) zone district is established to provide lands for and encourage the development of well-planned and designed technological-industrial parks which would accommodate certain light industrial, technological, professional offices, and other similar activities that require support by an airport facility for shipping, education, communication, research or other reasons. Because of the type of operation and high development standards employed, these parks may be adjacent to residential districts, provided that they are provided with access to arterial or collector streets and shall not be materially detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of such residential districts. This zone is also intended to accommodate certain commercial activities such as commercial parking lots, automobile rental facilities, hotels, and restaurants that support air and business travelers. 
The boundaries of any airport enterprise zone shall be established by the city council. Changes in the size of the airport enterprise zone are reviewed through the rezoning process in subsection 15.06.060.B. of this code. Generally, an airport enterprise zone shall be located adjacent to an aviation facility. 
a.  Performance Standards. Aviation-related manufacturing and distribution uses that meet the following performance standards as determined by the city manager shall be allowed in the AE zone district, provided: 
(i)  The activity does not involve the generation or storage of animal, vegetable, or other wastes that attract insects, rodents, or birds or otherwise create a hazard to aircraft operations; 
(ii)  The activity does not emit smoke, fly ash, dust, vapor, gases, or other forms of air pollution that would interfere with the safe operation of aircraft or that may conflict with present or planned operations of the airport; 
(iii)  The activity does not involve water impoundments, solid waste disposal, or other uses which attract birds or other animal species that may present a hazard to aircraft operations; 
(iv)  The activity does not emit glaring light or employ highly reflective surfaces that interfere with a pilot's ability to locate runways or landing pads; and 
(v)  The activity does not create electronic interference with communications among aviators and ground control personnel. 
b.  Accessory Storage Screening. Accessory storage shall be enclosed and concealed by a six-foot-high closed fence that prevents views of the interior. Screen fencing shall be maintained in an attractive condition. Fencing material shall be approved in advance by the city manager so as to be attractive to the area. Accessory outside storage shall not exceed the height of the fence, except for operable vehicles, trailers and other equipment designed to be towed or lifted as a single component. 
c.  Other Uses Permitted. Other nonresidential uses may be permitted as determined by the city manager that directly depend and associate with aviation operations. 
d.  Existing Residential and Commercial Uses. Expansion of existing residential or commercial buildings and structures, or erection of accessory buildings associated with existing residential or commercial buildings and structures are permitted uses. This provision shall apply only to existing uses and/or buildings and structures as of the effective date of properties being zoned aviation enterprise (AE). 
e.  Excluded Uses. All uses not specifically permitted or determined by the city manager to be permitted are excluded from the airport enterprise (AE) zone district. 
f.  General Requirements. The following requirements are applied in conjunction with the noise and height overlay restrictions itemized in this section, as well as those requirements specified by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(i)  Roads. No new road or trail may be closer than two thousand seven hundred feet from the end of any runway as projected from the end of the runway if extended in a straight line. 
(ii)  Interference. Uses may not interfere with airport operations or with aerial approaches. 
g.  General Performance. Within any airport enterprise zone district, no use shall be permitted, the nature or manner of operation of which shall be determined by the city manager, to be unduly hazardous or injurious to other properties in the vicinity or to the general public welfare by reason of the emission of odor, dust, smoke, noise, vibration, electrical, or other disturbance. The determination of the city manager shall be in the form of findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
h.  Conditions of Use. Processes and equipment employed and goods processed shall be limited to those that have limited emissions consisting of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, vibrations, refuse matter, water carried waste, or other emissions such that such emission will not interfere with aviation facility operations. 
i.  Access. All uses shall have access to an arterial or collector street that may be through the interior street network of the park. In no case shall any access be permitted onto local residential streets. 
j.  Off-Street Parking. The provisions of Section 15.14.040 of this code shall apply. 
k.  Signs. The provisions of Section 15.14.120 of this code shall apply. 
l.  Landscaping. The provisions of Section 15.14.050 of this code shall apply. 
7.  Noise Overlay (NO) Zone District. Areas included within the noise overlay are subjected to noise levels of such duration and frequency that they constitute a nuisance to residential and associated uses. In light of the associated hazards the following restrictions apply: 
a.  Development Restrictions. Residential uses that are allowed in accordance with a formally approved building permit effective at the time of commencing construction may be allowed if the use conforms with the performance standards listed below. 
(i)  Institutions and areas of public assembly are prohibited. Examples of these uses include, but are not limited to: schools, hospitals, rest or nursing homes, child care centers, churches, and outdoor amphitheaters. 
(ii)  Permitted office, commercial, nonresidential structures, including hotels and motels, and industrial uses may be allowed if constructed in conformance with the performance standards listed below. 
(iii)  Height restrictions as outlined in the height overlay district shall apply to lands within the noise overlay district. 
(iv)  All provisions associated with the underlying zone shall be in full force and effect. 
(v)  A signed "Aircraft Activity Covenant with Disclosure" must be filed prior to issuance of a building permit in favor of the aviation facility. 
b.  Performance Standards for Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Structures. Adherence to these standards will be determined by the city manager, and this determination will be based upon a description of the uses on the land, and of any proposed buildings or structures as submitted by the applicant. Information received from the aviation facility manager of the affected aviation facility also may be utilized in this determination. 
(i)  Those residential uses allowed in accordance with the provisions cited herein must incorporate noise level reduction measures sufficient to achieve an interior noise level of forty-five dB on the A-weighted scale when located within the boundaries of the sixty Ldn contour. 
(ii)  The portions of the commercial or industrial structures devoted to office uses, or occupied by members of the public must incorporate noise level reduction measures sufficient to achieve an interior noise level of forty-five dB on the A-weighted scale when located within the boundaries of the sixty Ldn contour. The noise reduction measures cited above are described in Chapter 35 of the Appendix of the Uniform Building Code, and as adopted by the city. Assurance that these measures have been incorporated into the structure is illustrated by submission of noise reduction plans certified by a registered professional engineer at the time of application for a building permit, and implemented prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(iii)  Uses must not produce steam, smoke, or otherwise pose a hazard to aviators. 
(iv)  Uses must not emit glaring light or employ highly reflective surfaces that may impair the visibility of aviators, nor shall-the use create interference with the electronic communication among aviators and ground control. 
(v)  Uses must lack the potential of attracting birds and other wildlife species that may pose a hazard to flight operations. 
8.  Height Overlay (HO). This area is characterized by frequent overflights by aircraft flying low to the ground upon an approach to landing, upon take-off, or operating in a traffic pattern at an aviation facility. Not only do the hazards of noise, particulates, and odors exist as in the entire airport influence area, but the location of natural and manmade objects may create severe hazards to aviation and must be regulated accordingly. 
a.  Development Restrictions. 
(i)  Applicants requesting rezonings, conditional uses, temporary uses, site plans, and building permits must complete an FAA aeronautical study on obstruction to determine the existence of a hazard to air navigation unless all buildings are restricted to less than fifty in height. If no hazard is determined, the proposed development may proceed, pending compliance with other city requirements. If a hazard to air navigation is found to exist by the FAA, then: 
(1)  The applicant is encouraged to alter the proposal so that the project does not present a hazard to air navigation; 
(2)  If alternative designs or locations which do not pose a compelling reason exist to allow this use, structure, or building within the height overlay zone district, the city will prepare findings of fact, to be entered in the application record by the appropriate official, citing the reasons why the use is compatible with the intent of the height overlay zone district. The aviation facility manager shall be notified of the action. Factors to consider in these findings include the importance of services provided by the proposed facility to the community, and the compatibility of the proposed use with the airport layout plan, and the comprehensive plan. 
(ii)  Applicants for development proposals will be required to fully document site elevations in relation to the F.A.R. Part 77 height restrictions. Documentation of site elevations shall consist of a topographic map of the site showing contours for every five feet of elevation change to illustrate the elevation above mean sea level; the location and height of any proposed buildings or structures, as well as natural features that impinge upon the Part 77 surfaces and the elevation of the aviation facility affecting the applicant's property. 
(iii)  Signed and recorded aviation easements will be required prior to issuance of a building permit in favor of the aviation facility. 
(iv)  Landowners may be required to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markers and lights that may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of a hazard that affects the aviation facility. This marking and lighting requirement may also extend to objects of natural growth (trees, primarily) on site. All markers shall meet FAA requirements. 
(v)  Applications for zone changes, conditional uses, temporary and special uses, site plans, and building permit will-be forwarded to the aviation facility manager of the pertinent aviation facility for review and comment concerning the impact of the proposal on aviation operations unless all proposed buildings are less than 50 feet in height. 
(vi)  All provisions associated with the underlying zone shall be in full force and effect. 
G.  Transitional Zones-Permitted Structures. In the area lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
H.  Modifying Existing Structures. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this section except as set forth in Section 15.26, enforcement. 
I.  Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
J.  Nonconforming Uses and Structures Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the airport board determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
K.  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section, may apply to the airport board for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this division. 
L.  Hazard Marking. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the airport board at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
M.  Prohibited Uses. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this section in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
N.  Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, and is diligently prosecuted. 
O.  Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding subsection 14 above, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport board to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the airport board.

Chapter 15.10 - USE REGULATIONS 

15.10.000 - Table of Permitted Uses. 
    Table 15.10-1 below lists the uses allowed within all base zoning districts. All uses are defined in Chapter 15.28, Definitions. Approval of a use listed in Table 15.10-1, and compliance with the applicable use-specific standards for that use, authorizes that use only. Development or use of a property for any other use not specifically allowed in Table 15.10-1 and approved under the appropriate process is prohibited. 
A.  Explanation of Table Abbreviations. 
1.  Permitted By-Right Uses. "P" in a cell indicates that the use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this Code, including the use-specific standards in this chapter and the requirements of chapter 15.14, Development Standards. 
2.  Conditional Uses. "C" in a cell indicates that, in the respective zoning district, the use is allowed only if reviewed and approved as a conditional use in accordance with the procedures of subsection 15.06.060.E, Conditional Use Permits. Conditional uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this Code, including the use-specific standards in this chapter and the requirements of chapter 15.14, Development Standards. 
3.  Prohibited Uses. A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district. 
4.  Use-Specific Standards. Regardless of whether a use is allowed by right or permitted as a conditional use, there may be additional standards that are applicable to the use. The existence of these use-specific standards is noted through a cross-reference in the last column of the table. Cross-references refer to Section 15.10.010, Use-Specific Standards. These standards apply in all districts unless otherwise specified. 
B.  Table Organization. In Table 15.10-1, land uses and activities are classified into general "use categories" and specific "use types" based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. This classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. This classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within the categories, and specific uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories. The use categories are intended merely as an indexing tool and are not regulatory. 
C.  Classification of New and Unlisted Uses. The city recognizes that new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not anticipated in this Code may seek to locate in the city. When application is made for a use category or use type that is not specifically listed in Table 15.10-1, the city manager's office shall make a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use in the following manner: 
1.  The city manager's office shall provide an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. In making such interpretation, the city manager's office shall consider the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity; sales; processing; type of product, storage and amount, and nature thereof; enclosed or open storage; anticipated employment; transportation requirements; the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material, and vibration likely to be generated; and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
2.  Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of a similar use. 
3.  Appeal of the city manager's office's decision shall be made to the planning commission following procedures under subsection 15.06.030.G. 
D.  Allowed Uses in Overlay Zone Districts. Uses allowed in all overlay districts in the city are set forth in Section 15.08.040 of this Code. Where uses are not listed for an overlay district, the allowed uses in the base zone district shall take precedence. Uses in the Airport Influence Area (AIA) may also contain use regulations as set forth in subsection 15.08.040.F of this Code.

Fences and walls shall meet the development standards of LMC 15.14.100, Fences and Walls, however, the fence may exceed eight feet in height where the difference in grade between the right-of-way and the outdoor storage area makes a taller fence necessary to effectively screen the area. Materials shall not be stored higher than the height of the primary structure unless stored in accordance with subsection 15.14.030.D.3.g. c. A landscaped earthen berm may be used instead of or in combination with a required fence or wall.

E.  General Requirements For All Temporary Uses and Structures. All temporary uses or structures shall meet the following general requirements, unless otherwise specified in this code: 
1.  The temporary use or structure shall not be detrimental to property or improvements in the surrounding area or to the public health, safety, or general welfare. 
2.  The temporary use shall comply with all applicable general and specific regulations of this Section 15.10.030, other city ordinances, and state law unless otherwise expressly stated. 
3.  Permanent alterations to the site are prohibited. 
4.  All temporary signs associated with the temporary use or structure shall be properly permitted and removed when the activity ends or permit expires, whichever occurs first. 
5.  The temporary use or structure shall not violate any applicable conditions of approval that apply to a principal use on the site. 
6.  The temporary use regulations of this section do not exempt the applicant or operator from any other required permits, such as food service or building permits. 
7.  If the property is undeveloped, it shall contain sufficient land area to allow the temporary use or structure to occur, as well as any parking and traffic circulation as required that may be associated with the temporary use, without disturbing sensitive or protected resources, including required buffers, one-hundred-year floodplains, and required landscaping. At the conclusion of the temporary use or at expiration of the permit, whichever occurs first, all disturbed areas of the site shall be restored or improved to the condition that existed prior to the use. 
8.  If the property is developed, the temporary use shall be located in an area that is not actively used by an existing approved principal use and that would support the proposed temporary use without encroaching or creating a negative impact on existing buffers, open space, landscaping, traffic movements, pedestrian circulation, or parking space availability. 
9.  Tents and other temporary structures shall be located so as not to interfere with the normal operations of any permanent use located on the property, shall be anchored, and meet the requirements of the building official, including fire rating. 
10.  Off-street parking shall be adequate to accommodate the proposed temporary use. 
11.  Applications for temporary structures to be located in the one-hundred-year floodplain shall be required to submit a plan to the city manager's office for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a flood notification. The plan shall include the following information:

b.  The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be removed; and 
c.  A plan to remove the temporary use earlier than the scheduled removal date, if required. 
12.  The conduct of the temporary use will not require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to restrict the ability to properly police the line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection to the city; 
13.  The conduct of such temporary use will not require the diversion of so great a number of ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to portions of the city other than that to be occupied by the proposed line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto; 
14.  The conduct of such temporary use will not interfere with the movement of firefighting equipment in route to a fire; 
15.  The size, nature, or location of the temporary use or structure is not reasonably likely to cause a clear and present danger of injury to persons and property; 
16.  Another temporary use permit application has not been received prior in time or has already been approved for the same time and place requested by the applicant or so close in time and place to that required by the applicant that the issuance of both permits would cause undue traffic congestion, or cause the city police or fire departments to be unable to meet the needs for police or fire services for both events; and 
17.  The location of the temporary use or structure will not substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon city streets. 
F.  Conditions of Approval-Major Temporary Use Permits. In addition to general conditions of approval that may be imposed pursuant to subsection 15.10.030.F., the decision-making authority may impose the following conditions on major temporary use permits to assure that such uses are not detrimental to the public health safety and welfare:

7.  Requirements for use of monitors for the use or structure and providing notice of temporary use permit conditions to event participants; 
8.  Restrictions on the number and type of vehicles, animals, or structures relating to the temporary use and inspection and approval of the use or structure for fire safety by the city fire department; 
9.  Requirements for use of garbage containers, cleanup, and restoration of city property; 
10.  Restrictions on use of amplified sound; 
11.  A requirement that the applicant and authorized officer of the sponsoring organization, if any, possess or obtain public liability insurance to protect against loss from liability imposed by law for damages on account of bodily injury and property damage arising from the event. If insurance coverage is required as a condition of issuance of a temporary use permit, the city manager shall detain the amount of insurance required, based upon the considerations routinely taken into account by the city in evaluating loss exposures, including, but not limited to, whether the temporary use or structure poses a substantial risk of damage or injury due to the anticipated number of participants, the nature of the use or structure, and activities involved and the physical characteristics of the proposed site. Such insurance shall name on the policy or by endorsement as additional insured, the city, its officers, employees, and agents. A certificate of insurance coverage must be filed with the city manager no less than five days before the date of the temporary use permit unless the city manager changes the filing deadline, in which event such documents shall be provided prior to the event; 
12.  A requirement that the applicant and authorized officer of the sponsoring organization, if any, sign an agreement for the permittee to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by it in repairing damage to city property occurring in connection with the permitted temporary use proximately caused by the actions of the permittee, his or her officers, employees, or agents, or any person who was under the permittee's control. Any such agreement may also provide that the permittee shall defend the city against, and indemnify and hold harmless, the city, its officers, employees, and agents from all causes of action, claims, or liabilities occurring in connection with the permitted use, except those which occur due to the city's sole negligence; and 
13.  Compliance with any relevant law and obtaining any legally required permit or license, including, without limitation, alcohol permits or vendor licenses. 
G.  Revocation of Temporary Use Permits. The city manager shall have the authority at any time to revoke or terminate a temporary use permit issued under this code upon violation of the standards for issuance as set forth in this section or conditions placed on the issuance of the temporary use permit.

15.12.010 - Measurements and exceptions. 
    This chapter contains tables that list the requirements for lot dimensions and building bulk, density, location, and height for all types of development. All primary and accessory structures are subject to the dimensional standards set forth in the following tables. These general standards may be further limited or modified by other applicable sections of this Code. 
A.  Lot Dimensions. 
1.  Established Lots. 
a.  Where an individual lot was held in separate ownership from adjoining properties, or was platted and recorded as of the effective date of this code, and has less area and/or less width than required in other sections of this chapter, such a lot may be occupied according to the permitted uses provided for the district in which such lot is located, provided that development shall be in conformity with all remaining applicable dimensional standards in this chapter. For purposes of this exception, two adjacent platted lots each twenty-four feet in width may be considered one, forty-eight-foot lot. 
b.  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, townhouse development shall meet existing lot dimension requirements except that on established lots as described in subsection (a), the minimum land area per townhouse structure shall be four thousand square feet and the minimum street frontage per townhouse structure shall be forty feet, and there shall be no minimum lot area per townhouse lot. 
2.  Allotments Must Serve Single Purposes. No part of an area or width required for a lot for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section shall be included as an area or width required for another building. 
3.  Street Frontage. Except in townhouse developments, no lot shall have a front lot line or street frontage of less than forty feet. 
B.  Setbacks. 
1.  General Setback Requirements. 
a.  Setbacks Must Serve Single Purposes. No part of a setback required for any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this division shall be included as a setback for another building. 
b.  Measurement of Setbacks. All setbacks shall be measured from property boundaries or adjacent rights-of-way. 
c.  Required Setbacks. 
(i)  Setbacks shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or portion of a structure from thirty inches above grade upward; provided, however, that fences, walls, trellises, poles, posts, ornaments, furniture, and other customary yard accessories may be permitted in any setback subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of visibility. 

Figure 15.2-1: Front, side and rear setbacks. 
(ii)  A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in this chapter for the zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this Code or unless a variance has been granted. 
d.  Projections into Required Setbacks, General. 
(i)  Incidental Architectural Features. Cornices, eaves, canopies, sunshades, gutters, chimneys, flues, belt courses, headers, sills, pilasters, lintels, ornamental features, and other similar architectural features may project not more than two feet into any required setback provided these projections are at least three feet from the lot line. 
(ii)  Fire escapes. Fire escapes may extend into a required setback not more than six feet. 
(iii)  Paved Terraces. Paved terraces may project into any required setback, provided that no structures placed there shall violate other requirements of this Code and are at least five feet from the lot line. 
(iv)  Unroofed Landings, Decks, Stairs, and Balconies. Unroofed landing, decks, and stairs shall not project into more than fifty percent of a required setback, provided that no portion other than a handrail shall extend higher than thirty inches above the finished grade level. Unroofed balconies may project into a required side or rear setback provided these projections are at least five feet from the lot line. 
(v)  Roofs Over Porches and Other Exterior Approaches. Roofs over porches, stairways, landings, terraces, or other exterior approaches to pedestrian doorways may encroach up to five feet into a front setback, provided that, where such roof projections encroach within the setback, the roof projections shall comprise no more than fifty percent of the total length of the building's façade. The covered porch or entrance area encroaching into the setback shall remain exterior to the building and enclosed by no more than a railing. 
(vi)  Projections Into Easements and Rights-of-Way Prohibited. Projections shall not extend or encroach into any easement(s) or right(s)-of-way. 
(vii)  Handicap Ramps. The city manager's office may allow the installation of handicap access ramps in required front, side, and rear setbacks. 
(viii)  [Bay Windows.] Bay windows that are not more than eight feet in width (where the projection breaks the plane of the wall) may project no more than two feet into any required setback, so long as there is a five-foot radius offset to any opposing bay window on the adjacent lot. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, bay windows shall not be included in determining lot coverage. 
(ix)  Private Garages and Carports. A private garage or carport may project into a required setback abutting a public alley not to exceed one-third the distance of the required setback, in accordance with other requirements of this code. 
e.  Double-Frontage Lots, Excluding Corner Lots. 
(i)  Existing Lots. Where lots comprising seventy-five percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between intersecting streets have been improved with buildings at the effective date of this ordinance, the front setback shall be on the dominant side of the street. Dominant, in this subsection, shall mean the street frontage on which seventy-five percent of the existing structures are addressed. 
(ii)  New Lots. The front lot line shall be designated on the final plat. A double frontage lot shall be required to have only one front setback. 
f.  Corner Lots with Two Frontages. 
(i)  Corner Lots. The side setback along the street side of a corner lot shall be one-half the front setback requirement for the zone in which the lot is located. 
(ii)  Corner Sight Distance. On any corner lot on which a front and side setback are required, no wall, fence, hedge, structure, sign, or any plant growth that obstructs the clear vision area shall be permitted. 
(iii)  Alternative Front Lot Line. The procedure for alternative front lot line designation shall follow the procedures set forth for conditional use in subsection 15.06.060.E.3; provided, however, that the provisions of [subsection] 15.06.060.E.3.d. shall not apply as they pertain to published and posted public-notice requirements. The provisions of [subsection] 15.06.060.E.3.d. shall apply as they pertain to written public-notice requirements, except that written notice of the request need only be mailed to adjacent property owners not including consideration of right-of-way at least ten days prior to scheduled consideration by the planning commission. The planning commission shall accept and consider written and/or oral public comment in consideration of the request; however, the consideration shall not be deemed a "public hearing" under [subsection] 15.06.060.E.3.e.(i) or as elsewhere determined by this title. 
2.  Minimum Front Setbacks on Established Residential Blocks. In any LR, R1, R2 or R3 district where lots comprising fifty percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between intersecting streets have been improved with buildings at the effective date of this code per Section 15.02.030, the minimum front setback of new construction shall be the same as the minimum front setback of any existing buildings in the block, or the minimum front setback for the district specified in subsection 15.12.000.B., whichever is less. 
C.  Height. 
1.  Height Requirements Generally. No building shall be erected or altered that will exceed the height limit for the respective zoning district, unless otherwise provided in subsection b. Below or elsewhere in this code. 
2.  Height Measurement. Per Chapter 15.28, Definitions, the height of a building shall be the vertical distance from the grade to the highest point of the roof surface. 
3.  Height Exceptions. 
a.  Maximum. The height limitations of this section shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, penthouses, nor to chimneys, ventilators, skylights, water tanks, parapet walls, cornices without windows, antennas, or necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried above the roof level; nor to buildings located more than one foot from the nearest lot line for each two feet of building height. 
b.  Minimum. No person shall build within the city any basement, placing thereon a roof or any covering to serve as a roof and use such basement for either dwelling or business purposes, whether temporary or permanent. 
D.  Dimensional Standards for Townhouse Structures. 
1.  The minimum dimension for a townhouse structure and for a contiguous series of accessory buildings shall be sixty feet as measured perpendicular to the common walls. 
2.  The maximum dimension for a townhouse structure and for a contiguous series of accessory buildings shall be 180 feet as measured perpendicular to the common walls. 
3.  Platted lots abutting dedicated streets in which water and sanitary sewer service lines have, as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this section, been installed to fit a plan for townhouse construction are exempt from the requirements of subsections 1. and 2. above.

Chapter 15.14 - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

15.14.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Purpose. The development and design standards set forth in this chapter shall apply to the physical layout and design of development in Laramie. These provisions address the physical relationship between development and adjacent properties, public streets, neighborhoods, and the natural environment, in order to implement the comprehensive plan vision for a more attractive, efficient, and livable community. The specific purposes of this chapter include: 
1.  To implement the Laramie comprehensive plan through the creation and application of development standards that reflect Laramie's community character and development choices; 
2.  To encourage the proper use of the land by promoting an appropriate balance between the built environment and the preservation and protection of open space and natural resources; 
3.  To protect public and private investment through preservation of open spaces, protection of natural resources including existing trees, providing buffers between incompatible uses and along roadways, and encouraging the planting of new trees and vegetation as deemed appropriate; 
4.  To promote sound management of water quality and quantity through preservation of natural areas and their functions and by encouraging soil management and the use of native plant materials; 
5.  To provide appropriate standards to ensure a high quality appearance for Laramie and promote good design while also allowing flexibility, individuality, creativity, and artistic expression; 
6.  To strengthen and protect the image, identity, and unique character of Laramie and thereby to enhance its business economy; 
7.  To protect and enhance residential neighborhoods, commercial districts, and other areas by encouraging physical development that is of high quality and is compatible with the character, scale, and function of its surrounding area; 
8.  To encourage developments that relate to adjoining public streets, open spaces, and neighborhoods with building orientation and physical connections that contribute to the surrounding network of streets and walkways; and 
9.  To provide road connectivity for the movement of people, goods, and services. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  New Development. The development standards of this code shall apply to all new development of the type identified in each section or subsection. 
2.  Enlargement or Modifications to an Existing Development. 
a.  Except in the case of residential design standards for detached and attached one-and two-family dwellings, additions and modifications to an existing development shall fully comply with the development standards of this code including but not limited to building design, building materials, parking, landscaping, screening, buffering, and public improvements. The development standards shall apply to the entirety of the existing development if proposed development: 
(i)  Increases the number of stories of a building on the lot; or 
(ii)  Increases the size of a structure by more than twenty percent or twenty thousand square feet, whichever is less, as measured by the combined gross floor areas of a building; or 
(iii)  Increases the non-permeable lot coverage by more than two thousand square feet. 
b.  Exceptions. Alternative design that satisfactorily meets the intent of the code may be granted pursuant to [subsection] 15.06.060.J, minor administrative modification. 
3.  Redevelopment of an Existing Development. Redevelopment involving demolition of one or more principal buildings shall require full compliance with the standards of this code within the development pad, included but not limited to, construction of principal and accessory buildings, driveways, walkways, loading areas and storage yards; public improvements or a development area is internal to a development site. 
a.  Exceptions. Alternative design that satisfactorily meets the intent of the code may be granted pursuant to [subsection] 15.06.060.J, minor administrative modification. 
4.  Change of Use. Section 15.10.010 identifies use categories and corresponding use levels. The development standards of this code shall apply to changes of use within or outside of use levels as follows: 
a.  Change of use within each use level as shown in table 15.10-2 of subsection 15.10.010 shall not require mandatory compliance with the development standards of Chapter 15.14 [of] this code. For example, a change of use from a financial institution (Level 6-Financial Service) to a clothing store (Level 6-Retail) shall not require compliance with the development standards of Chapter 15.14 [of] this code. 
b.  Change of use between adjacent levels as shown in table 15.10-2 of subsection 15.10.010 shall require compliance with [subsection] 15.14.050.F., site perimeter landscaping, for all adjacent street frontages. For example, a change of use from a clothing store (Level 6-Retail) to a restaurant (Level 7-Food and Beverage Services) shall require compliance with [subsection] 15.14.050.F., site perimeter landscaping, for all adjacent street frontages, internal landscaping, and site perimeter landscaping not adjacent to rights-of-way shall not be required. 
c.  Change of use differing by two or more levels as shown in table 15.10-2 of subsection 15.10.010 shall require full compliance with the development standards of this code. For example, a change of use from a clothing store (Level 6-Retail) to a wholesale business (Level 8-Wholesale Business) shall require full compliance with the development standards of this chapter, including but not limited to parking, landscaping, and screening. 
d.  Exceptions. 
(i)  Multi-tenant Commercial Complex. Change of use within a multi-tenant complex shall not require conformance with the development standards of the chapter provided that the use is permitted within the zoning district and the change of use does not result in any addition to the existing structure. Exterior modifications such as signage, screening of new mechanical units and compliance with parking shall be required to conform to applicable standards of this chapter. 
(ii)  Alternative design that satisfactorily meets the intent of the chapter may be granted pursuant to [subsection] 15.06.060.J, minor administrative modification. 
5.  Interior Improvements/Remodel. Where development changes are wholly internal to the existing structure and there is no change of use, the development standards of this chapter shall not be mandatory. Examples of internal changes to a building shall include, but are not limited to, work performed in conjunction with a plumbing, electrical permit, mechanical permit or interior structural alteration. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-20-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 18(Att. C), 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1706 , §§ 5-7, 5-3-2016) 
15.14.020 - Natural resource protection and sustainability. 
A.  Purpose. The city contains many natural amenities, including stream corridors, river corridors, natural drainages, significant viewsheds, hillsides, tree cover, and open space-all of which contribute to the city's character, quality of life, and property values. The regulations of this section are intended to implement the Laramie comprehensive plan and ensure that the natural character of the city is reflected in patterns of development and redevelopment, and significant natural features are protected and incorporated into open space areas. 
B.  Applicability. These development standards apply to all development types in the areas identified according to criteria specified in subsections C. through F. 
C.  Steep Slope Development. [Reserved]. 
    [This section is reserved for potential future amendment to include steep slope development standards and processes, in accordance with the Laramie comprehensive plan.] 
D.  Ridgeline Protection. [Reserved]. 
    [This section is reserved for potential future amendment to include ridgeline-protection standards and processes, in accordance with the Laramie comprehensive plan.] 
E.  Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control. 
1.  All new development shall be subject to the following erosion prevention and sediment control standards: 
a.  Compliance with applicable city and state requirements shall be required. 
b.  Water shall be carried off the site without damage to downhill public or private properties and/or improvements. 
c.  Water shall be directed away from buildings and other heavily used areas. 
d.  Post-development discharge of stormwater shall not exceed predevelopment discharge for a one-hundred-year storm event. 
e.  Unnecessary ponding not intended for detention or retention purposes should be avoided. 
f.  Erosion control measures as necessary to control erosion and sedimentation during site development and construction shall be implemented. These may include, but are not limited to, the placement of hay bales and siltation fences. 
2.  Grading Plan-Revegetation of Disturbed Sites. A grading plan, submitted and approved pursuant to subsection 15.06.060.S. grading permits and demonstrating compliance with the above standards, shall be required prior to commencement of site grading. Following construction, the site shall be reclaimed and revegetated following the standards of Section 15.14.050, landscaping and screening standards. In areas of subdivisions and development sites where landscaping is not required or not anticipated by the city manager's office, the developer shall reclaim all disturbed property and replant the entire area with native vegetation. Topsoil shall be stockpiled and placed on disturbed areas. Irrigation shall be provided to the revegetated areas if it is necessary to ensure survival of native species planted. The grading plan shall include a section outlining the type and extent of revegetation proposed to accomplish this requirement. 
F.  Stormwater Management-Redevelopment of Existing Lot or Parcel. All redevelopment shall conform to the following stormwater management requirements: 
1.  Redevelopment of the site shall not have adverse effects on the city stormwater drainage system. 
2.  As determined by the city engineer, redevelopment of the site shall not have detrimental effects on any applicable city approved drainage basin area.

15.14.030 - Alternative energy. 
A.  Solar Energy. 
1.  Solar Energy Systems. 
a.  Purpose. This section is intended to promote the compatible use of solar energy systems and to assist in decreasing the city's dependence upon non-renewable energy systems through the encouragement of solar energy systems for the heating of buildings and water. 
b.  Standards. Solar energy systems shall be a permitted use in all zoning districts subject to the following requirements. Private restrictions on solar energy systems, such as homeowner's association covenants or restrictions, shall not be permitted. 
c.  Height. In solar retrofit installations: Solar energy collectors, storage tanks and equipment, roof ponds, or other solar equipment appurtenant to a solar energy system may exceed by three feet the maximum height limits established by this code. Systems taller than three feet above any maximum height shall be subject to the conditional use permit process set forth in subsection 15.06.060.E. 
d.  Setbacks. In solar retrofit installations, solar energy collectors, storage tanks and equipment, roof ponds, or other solar equipment appurtenant to a solar energy system may extend into the required setbacks a maximum of three feet. Systems extending more than three feet into any required setback shall be subject to the conditional use permit process set forth in subsection 15.06.060.E. 
e.  Conflict with Other Municipal Policies and Ordinances. Nothing in this subsection does, or is intended to, abrogate the owner's responsibility to meet all other requirements of this code, including, but not limited to the following: preservation of private and public views, the quality of architectural design, the preservation of historic landmark structures, or the like. 
2.  Solar Rights. 
a.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city by encouraging the use of solar energy systems. It is the intent of this section to provide a means of protection for the use of solar collectors without causing undue hardships on the rights of adjacent property owners. 
b.  Procedure and Applicability. 
(i)  The procedure for the issuance of a solar access permit is found in subsection 15.06.060.L. 
(ii)  Solar access permits shall not be permitted for properties in the Downtown Commercial zoning district. 
c.  Solar Access Permit Required for Protection of Solar Right. 
(i)  A solar permit shall be issued before a solar right may be established under this chapter. 
(ii)  A solar permit shall be granted for any proposed or existing solar collector that complies with the requirements of this chapter and other city ordinances and state law. 
(iii)  Solar rights under applications filed subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall vest on the date the solar permit is issued, which date shall also be the priority date of the solar right. The solar collector shall be put to beneficial use within two years of that time, except additional time may be granted by the city engineer for good cause shown. The city manager's office shall certify the right and its beneficial use within two years of its vesting. In the event beneficial use has not been established, the city manager's office shall revoke the permit and record the revocation with the Albany County clerk. 
(iv)  Users of solar collectors that existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall apply for permit(s) within five years after the effective date. Failure to apply for and receive such permit(s) shall require that the or the collectors be removed. The priority date for these solar rights shall be the first date the solar collector was beneficially used, which shall be determined by the city manager's office. 
d.  Restrictions on Solar Rights. 
(i)  Solar collectors shall be located on the solar user's property so as not to unreasonably or unnecessarily restrict the uses of neighboring property. Unreasonable or unnecessary restriction shall include, but not be limited to, any restriction that would prohibit the uses allowed by city code (but not including planting of trees). 
(ii)  No solar right shall attach to a solar collector or a portion of a solar collector, that would be shaded by a hypothetical nonlight-transmitting, ten-foot high wall located on the property line on a winter solstice day. 
(iii)  The solar right to radiation of the sun before nine a.m. or after three p.m. Mountain Time is de minimus and may be infringed without compensation to the owner of the solar collector. 
(iv)  A solar right that is not applied to a beneficial use for a period of five years or more shall be deemed abandoned and without priority. 
(v)  The priority of new construction with regard to interference in solar rights shall vest as of the date of application for a building permit. 
e.  Prior Existing Uses. 
(i)  The lawful location of structures in existence prior to the time of beneficial use of an existing solar energy collection system or in existence at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title may be continued, even though the location does not conform to the requirements of this section, provided the structure conforms or is legally non-conforming in other aspects under this title. 
(ii)  The solar applicant shall be required to take the permit subject to the natural growth of all vegetation that exists at the time of filing the application. 
(iii)  Such structure or vegetation that has been damaged by fire or a calamity may be restored to its original condition or replanted, provided the work is commenced within eighteen months of the calamity. In addition, normal and routine maintenance of structures may be carried on. 
(iv)  Whenever the use of such a structure or presence of vegetation has been discontinued for a period of eighteen months, the structure or vegetation shall not thereafter be re-established, unless such future use shall be in conformance with provisions of this title. 
3.  Solar Oriented Lots. 
a.  Purpose. It is the city's intent to encourage the use of both active and passive solar energy systems for heating air and water in homes and businesses, as long as natural topography, soil, or other subsurface conditions or other natural conditions peculiar to the site are preserved. While the use of solar energy systems is optional, the right to solar access is protected. Solar collectors require access to available sunshine during the entire year, including between the hours of nine a.m. and three p.m., Mountain Time on the winter solstice date, when the longest shadows occur. Additionally, a goal of this section is to ensure that site plan elements do not excessively shade adjacent properties, creating a significant adverse impact upon the solar potential of adjacent property owners. Thus, standards are set forth to evaluate the potential impact of shade caused by buildings, structures, and trees. 
b.  Solar-Oriented Residential Lots. At least forty percent of the lots less than fifteen thousand square feet in area in single- and two-family residential developments shall conform to the definition of a "solar-oriented lot" in order to preserve the potential for solar energy usage. 
c.  Access to Sunshine. The elements of the development plan (e.g., buildings, circulation, open space, and landscaping) shall be located and designed, to the maximum extent feasible, to protect access to sunshine for planned solar energy systems or for solar-oriented rooftop surfaces that can support a solar collector or collectors capable of providing for the anticipated hot water needs of the buildings in the project between the hours of nine a.m. and three p.m. Mountain Time, on December 21. 
4.  Clothes Lines. Clothes lines shall be permitted in all residential and mixed-use zoning districts. 
B.  Wind Energy. 
1.  Wind Energy Systems-Generally. 
a.  Purpose. This section is intended to promote the compatible use of wind energy systems that are designed for compatibility with urban and suburban locations. Wind energy is an abundant, renewable, and nonpolluting energy resource. When converted to electricity, it reduces our dependence on nonrenewable energy resources and reduces air and water pollution that result from more conventional sources. Distributed wind energy structures also enhance the reliability and power quality of the power grid, reduce peak power demands, and increase local electricity generation. 
This section recognizes that only certain types of wind energy systems are suitable for urban and suburban areas. Two different types of wind energy systems are recognized for use in the city. For purposes of this title, they are defined and classified as follows: Small wind energy systems (SWESs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). 

Figure 15.14.030-1: Small residential wind energy system. 
2.  Small Wind Energy Systems (SWESs)-Permitted Districts, Height Standards. Small Wind Energy Systems (SWESs) shall be a permitted use in all zoning districts except Downtown Commercial (DC). They are subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Height. The maximum height of a SWES shall be seventy-five feet, measured from grade to the highest point on the SWES. SWESs taller than seventy-five feet may be allowed, subject to the conditional use permit process set forth in subsection 15.06.060.E. 

Figure 15.14.030-2: Vertical axis wind turbine. 
3.  Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs)-Permitted Districts, Number per Lot, Height Standards. A Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) using vertical wind turbine technology shall be permitted in all zoning districts as an accessory use, subject to the following requirements: 
a.  VAWTs-Residential District Requirements. 
(i)  A maximum of one VAWT is permitted per lot or one VAWT per acre, whichever is greater. 
(ii)  For VAWTs mounted on rooftops or otherwise attached to a building, the maximum height for a VAWT shall not exceed the maximum-height standard for a principal building in the applicable zoning district (table 15.12-2), measured from grade to the highest point on the VAWT. 
(iii)  For VAWTs mounted on freestanding towers, the maximum tower height for a VAWT shall not exceed forty feet, measured from the base of the tower to the highest point on the VAWT. 
b.  VAWTs-Non-Residential District Requirements. Multiple VAWTs are permitted on any non-residential district lot, subject to the following requirements: 
(i)  For VAWTs mounted on rooftops or otherwise attached to a building, the maximum height for a VAWT shall not exceed 10 feet, measured vertically from the point of attachment on the building to the highest point on the VAWT. 
(ii)  For VAWTs mounted on freestanding towers, the maximum tower height for a VAWT shall not exceed sixty feet, measured from the base of the tower to the highest point on the VAWT. 
(iii)  Lightpole-mounted VAWTs shall not exceed twenty-five feet in height measured from grade to the highest point on the VAWT. 
4.  Setbacks-All Wind Energy Systems. 
a.  A SWES or VAWT mounted on a principal or accessory building shall be set back a distance equal to or greater than the applicable zoning district required minimum building setback, as specified in Section 15.12.000 (tables 15.12-1 through 15.12-4) ; provided, however, that in no case shall the setback be less than five feet (subsection 15.14.030.B.10.e). 
b.  A freestanding tower for a SWES or VAWT shall be set back a distance equal to or greater than 1.0 times its total height from: 
(i)  Any public road right of way, unless written permission is granted by the governmental entity with jurisdiction over the road; 
(ii)  Any overhead utility lines, unless written permission is granted by the affected utility; and 
(iii)  All property lines, unless written permission is granted from the affected land owner. 
The preceding subsections notwithstanding, in no case shall the setback for a freestanding SWES or VAWT tower be less than five feet (subsection 15.14.030.B.10.e). 
5.  Lighting-All Wind Energy Systems. A SWES or VAWT shall not be artificially lighted unless such lighting is required by the Federal Aviation Administration. A light temporarily used to inspect a turbine, tower, and associated equipment shall be permissible, providing said light is only used for inspection purposes and not left on for an extended period of time. 
6.  Decibel Levels-All Wind Energy Systems. Decibel levels for the SWES or VAWT shall not exceed sixty decibels (dBa) as measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling, except during short-term events such as utility outages and severe wind storms. 
7.  Signs-All Wind Energy Systems. All signs, other than the manufacturer's or installer's identification, appropriate warning signs, or owner identification on a wind generator, tower, building, or other structure associated with a SWES or VAWT that are visible from any public right-of-way shall be prohibited. 
8.  Code Compliance-All Wind Energy Systems. A SWES or VAWT structure including tower shall comply with all applicable state construction and electrical codes, and the National Electrical Code as adopted by the city. 
9.  Screening-All Wind Energy Systems. Ground-level mechanical equipment associated with the SWES or VAWT shall conform to the utility screening standards of subsection 15.14.050.H. 
10.  Other Standards-All Wind Energy Systems. 
a.  The SWES or VAWT structure shall comply with all applicable Federal Aviation Administration requirements, including but not limited to Subpart B (commencing with Section 77.11) of Part 77 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding installations in excess of two hundred feet in height, and installations close to airports. The system shall also comply with any and all Wyoming Aeronautics regulations. 
b.  All electrical wires associated with a SWES or VAWT, other than wires necessary to connect the wind generator to the tower wiring, the tower wiring to the disconnect junction box, and the grounding wires, shall be located underground. 
c.  All ground mounted electrical and control equipment for the SWES or VAWT shall be labeled or secured to prevent unauthorized access. 
d.  A SWES or VAWT tower shall be designed and installed so as to not provide step bolts or a ladder readily accessible to the public for a minimum height of eight feet above the ground. 
e.  No part of the SWES or VAWT installation, including guy wire anchors, may be closer than five feet from any property boundary. 
11.  New Technology-All Wind Energy Systems. The city manager's office may waive the provisions of these requirements through the Alternative Equivalent Compliance process in subsection 15.06.060.K. where the availability of new technology alleviates the issues addressed by these regulations. 
12.  Temporary Meteorological (Met) Towers. Temporary meteorological (Met) towers shall be permitted under the same standards as a SWES, except that the requirements shall be the same as those for a temporary structure. A permit for a temporary met tower shall be valid for a maximum of three years, after which an extension may be granted. Permanent Met towers may be permitted under the same standards as a SWES. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-20-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 21, 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1728 , § 16, 4-18-2017) 
15.14.040 - Parking and off-street loading. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish standards for vehicle parking, bicycle parking, loading areas, and for trash facilities. These standards are established in order to provide for the safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians and to reduce hazards to public safety. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  Plan. Parking design and striping for non-residential and multifamily uses shall require approval by the appropriate decision-making entity, in conjunction with either site plan, (subsection 15.06.060.O.) or the minor administrative modification process, (subsection 15.06.060.J.), as applicable. Certain minor refurbishment activities within existing parking areas shall not require plan review, as specified in subsection 15.22.000.G. 
Parking spaces required to meet the standards of this chapter shall be located on the same lot or zoning lot as the building or use served unless the city manager's office determines that location of the parking on-site would result in an unnecessary hardship and that the intent of this chapter would be better served by locating the required parking on another site within one thousand feet of the use. 
2.  Credit for Public Parking. Some or all of the required off-street parking spaces may be waived by the city manager's office if publicly owned off-street parking is located within a one thousand-foot walking distance from the main entrance of the proposed use, and the city manager's office also determines that adequate parking spaces are available within the publicly owned parking area to accommodate the anticipated use. Credit may also be given for on-street parking spaces located within 250 feet of an entry of the building in which the use is located. 
3.  Minimum Vehicle Parking Requirements. 
a.  Properties located within the DC zoning district are exempt from minimum parking requirements unless otherwise provided for in that district. 
b.  Requirements for the minimum number of parking spaces for each use are listed in table 15.14.040-3, off-street parking standards. 
c.  The requirements may result in the calculation of a fractional parking space. If the fraction is less than one-half, the fraction may be deleted. If the fraction is one-half or greater, the fraction shall count as one parking space. 
d.  Off-street parking for separate uses may be provided collectively if all other regulations are observed. A parking space designated for one use shall not be designated as fulfilling the requirements for another use unless approved by the city manager's office, or unless the space meets the applicable criteria specified in subsection 15.14.040.5. 
e.  Vehicle parking requirements for uses not specified in this chapter shall be determined by the city manager's office based upon the requirements of similar uses. Where use specific performance standards have been established for a use in this chapter that include parking requirements, the parking requirements associated with the use specific performance standards shall supersede the requirements contained in table 15.14.040-3, off-street parking standards. 
f.  For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, fleet vehicle parking spaces shall not count against either the minimum or maximum requirements. 
4.  Maximum Parking Spaces Allowed. 
a.  For any use categorized as a "commercial" or "industrial" use in Chapter 15.10 of this code, off-street vehicle parking spaces shall not be provided in an amount that is more than one hundred twenty-five percent of the minimum requirements established in table 15.14.040-3: off-street parking standards. 
b.  For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, the following types of parking spaces shall not count against the maximum parking requirement: 
(i)  Accessible parking; 
(ii)  Vanpool and carpool parking; 
(iii)  On-street parking adjacent to the lot or lots on which the parking is located; 
(iv)  Structured parking, underground parking, and parking within, above, or beneath the building(s) it serves; and 
(v)  Fleet vehicle parking spaces associated with the use. 
c.  Exceptions to the maximum parking requirement may be allowed by the city manager's office in situations that meet the following criteria: 
(i)  The proposed development has unique or unusual characteristics such as high sales volume per floor area or low parking turnover, that create a parking demand that exceeds the maximum ratio and that typically does not apply to comparable uses; 
(ii)  The parking demand cannot be accommodated by on-street parking, shared parking with nearby uses, or by increasing the supply of spaces that are exempt from the maximum ratio; 
(iii)  The request is the minimum necessary variation from the standards. 
d.  If application of the maximum parking standard would result in fewer than six parking spaces, the development shall be allowed six parking spaces. 
5.  Shared Parking. Parking lots for different buildings, structures, uses, or mixed uses may be provided and used collectively or jointly in any district in which separate off-street parking facilities for each use would be permitted, subject to the following provisions: 
a.  A reciprocal written agreement assuring joint usage of such common parking shall be executed by the parties concerned and approved by the city attorney and the City Manager's Office. The agreement shall be recorded in the Office of Albany County clerk. Any amendments to the agreement or its terms shall be reviewed for relevancy, approved by the city and recorded in the office of Albany County clerk. 
b.  Up to sixty percent of the parking spaces required for theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, dance halls and night clubs, and up to one hundred percent of the parking spaces required for a church use, may be provided and used jointly by financial institutions, offices and similar uses not normally open, used or operated during the same hours as those uses. 
c.  Where shared parking is contemplated, the applicant may be required to include parking accumulation studies as a part of the request for approval by the city manager's office. The study shall include an analysis of the parking demand for each hour over a twelve to twenty-four-hour period for a typical high volume day. This shall determine the minimum number of spaces that shall be provided. Based on the study submitted, if the maximum number of vehicles accumulated during a peak hour or hours for all overlapping uses exceeds the number of spaces that are required to be provided, shared parking shall be limited. A prorated number of shared parking spaces may be permitted based on the justification information of the study. 
6.  Minimum Bicycle Parking Requirements. 
a.  Bicycle parking requirements shall apply to all uses except single-family detached, single-family attached or two-family dwelling uses. 
b.  At minimum, the greater of three bicycle parking spaces or a number of bicycle spaces equal to five percent of all off-street parking spaces provided shall be required. 
c.  Bicycle parking shall be provided with racks approved by the city manager's office. 
d.  Bicycle parking areas shall not impede travel on designated sidewalks or accessways on site. 
e.  Bicycle parking shall be located within one hundred feet from a primary entrance of a commercial or multifamily use. 
7.  Required Accessible Parking. 
a.  In addition to the parking required by table 15.14.040-3: Off-street parking standards, the parking space requirements listed in table 15.14.040-1 shall be provided for all nonresidential uses. All parking shall conform to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), building code, or these standards, whichever is more restrictive. In addition, van accessible spaces and loading areas may also be required by the building code.

b.  In addition to the parking required by Table 15.14.040-3: Off-Street Parking Standards of this section, the parking space requirements listed in Table 15.14.040-2 shall apply for multifamily residential uses. These spaces shall be specifically assigned first to disabled accessible residential unit(s). Any extra spaces shall be unassigned. All parking shall conform to the requirements of the ADA, building code or these standards, whichever is more restrictive. In addition, van accessible spaces and loading areas may also be required by the building code.

C.  Design Standards. 
1.  Parking Lot Access and Circulation. Parking lot access and circulation parking lots should be designed with a hierarchy of circulation. For example, major driveways should be clearly delineated by landscaped areas and should have limited or no parking along them while parking aisles should provide direct access to parking spaces. Parking lots shall not dominate the street frontage, interrupt pedestrian routes, or negatively impact surrounding neighborhoods. Parking lots should be located behind buildings or in the interior of a block whenever possible. Parking areas shall not abut street intersections. All sites, where feasible, shall allow two-way cross-access to adjacent parcels. Parking lot design shall also incorporate the standards of subsection 15.14.060.F. (pedestrian circulation). 
2.  Parking Lot Lighting. All parking lot lighting shall comply with the lighting requirements contained in Chapter 15.14.080 (Lighting). The following additional standards shall apply: 
a.  A parking-lot lighting fixture shall not exceed twenty-four feet in height, including the base or pedestal, measured from grade, and shall be located so as to not impede pedestrian or vehicular travel. 
b.  A parking-lot luminaire shall be so oriented and shielded that it does not shine directly onto an abutting property. 
c.  A parking-lot luminaire shall direct light downward and the bulb shall not be visible below the fixture head, and the light source shall be recessed within the fixture. 
3.  Surfacing. 
a.  All parking lots, parking spaces, drive aisles, drive thrus, vehicle stacking areas, loading zones, trash handling facilities, accessways, and driveways (excluding driveways on single-family detached residential driveways on lots over sixteen thousand square feet in area) shall be surfaced with portland cement concrete or plant mixed bituminous paving materials prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless a delay is approved by the city manager's office and any financial security posted per subsection 15.14.040.C.3.e. below. 
b.  With the approval of the city manager's office, permeable or pervious surface pavement may be used. Neither gravel nor unfinished road bed shall be considered permeable pavement. All surfacing shall be designed to support anticipated loads and to remain dust-free. 
c.  The surface shall be maintained so that traffic may move safely in and out of the parking area. 
d.  For all developments requiring more than four parking spaces pursuant to table 15.14.040.C, continuous curbs shall be installed on all edges of parking areas, drive aisles and maneuvering areas, and adjacent to any landscaped area. 
e.  Surfacing of the parking area may be delayed until the next construction season with written approval from the city manager's office. A performance bond or letter of credit for one hundred twenty-five percent of the surfacing materials and labor costs may be required to be posted by the city manager's office to ensure the completion and placement of the required surface. 
4.  Drive and Access Ways. All driveways and access ways shall comply with the access requirements contained in subsection 15.14.060.E.4., driveways and access. 
5.  Landscaping. All landscaping shall comply with the applicable landscaping requirements contained in Section 15.14.050 (landscaping and screening standards). 
6.  Off-Street Utility, Dumpster, Recycling and Trash Handling Facilities. All utility, dumpster, recycling and trash handling facilities shall comply with the screening requirements contained in subsections 15.14.050.H. and I. 
7.  Distribution of Parking. To the maximum extent feasible, parking shall be distributed between the front, side and rear of the building(s). Not more than seventy-five percent of the required parking shall be located in front of the building. 
8.  Dividing Parking Lots. Parking lots containing more than two hundred parking stalls shall be divided into two or more lots, separated by an L2 landscaped area (see table 15.14.050-3) that may be counted toward the required off-street parking landscaping area. Within each parking lot, parking spaces shall be grouped into blocks of forty to fifty spaces with each block separated from the others by curbed planting areas at least the size of one parking stall. 
9.  Access. 
a.  Each off-street parking space shall open directly onto an aisle or driveway that is designed to provide safe and efficient vehicular access to each parking space. Parking shall not be allowed to impede traffic movement on alleys or streets or to impede pedestrian or bicycle activities. 
b.  Off-street facilities shall be designed and constructed with turnaround areas to prevent back up movement onto arterial streets. The location and design of all access to arterial and collector streets are subject to review and approval of the city manager's office. Accesses to arterial or collector streets shall be located a minimum of one hundred fifty feet from any other access or street intersection, measured from centerline to centerline. Minor modifications to this minimum may be granted by the city manager's office in accordance with subsection 15.06.060.J., minor modifications. Evaluations of minor modifications shall consider posted speed of the street on which access is proposed, constraints due to lot patterns and effects on safety and capacity of the adjacent public street, bicycle and pedestrian facilities. No development site shall be permitted more than one access to any arterial or collector street as defined by the city major street and highway system plan, except as approved by the city manager's office in accordance with subsection 15.06.060.J., minor modifications. As part of any expansion or alteration in use, the city may require relocation and/or reconstruction of existing access not meeting the city's standards. 
10.  Backing or Maneuvering. 
a.  Developments required to provide three or more parking spaces shall not be designed to have backing or maneuvering movements for any of the parking spaces occurring across public sidewalks or within any public street other than an alley, except as approved by department. 
b.  Where backing movements from a driveway to the public right-of-way are allowed, all off-street parking shall be provided so that a minimum of twenty feet of length is provided from the sidewalk or future sidewalk to the garage or carport except as approved by the city manager's office. Where no sidewalk location has been established, a twenty-foot separation from the right-of-way edge to the parking structure shall be required, except as approved by the city manager's office. 
11.  Dimensions. 
a.  The parking configurations described in table 15.14.030-4, below, shall apply as appropriate. Table 15.14.040-4 measurements are calculated according to the parking angle dimension measurement diagram (Figure 15.14.040-1). Both sides of a parking stall shall be at the same angle.

b.  Off-street parking spaces shall be measured exclusive of any access drives, aisles or columns. 
c.  Nonresidential parking spaces and multifamily parking spaces shall be clearly outlined with single lines, four inches in width and of white color on the surface of the lot so that each parking space is clearly identified. 
d.  The minimum length of a parking stall that is adjacent to a landscaped island may be reduced as described in Column G for vehicle overhang provided suitable ground cover is placed an equivalent distance behind the curb. For double head-in parking, the landscape island shall be a minimum of eight feet in width. 
e.  The minimum length of a parking stall that is adjacent to a sidewalk or pedestrian walkway may be reduced as described in Column G for vehicle overhang provided that an additional two feet of sidewalk width is provided. For double head-in parking, an additional four feet of sidewalk width shall be provided. 
f.  All spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of six feet, six inches. 
g.  No parking shall be allowed in travel aisles. 
h.  For parking lots containing twenty or more parking spaces, all aisles, approach lanes and maneuvering shall be clearly marked with directional arrows and lines to facilitate traffic movement. 
i.  Parking spaces using geometric standards other than those specified here may be approved, subject to a determination by the city manager's office that the plans for the facility are sealed by a registered engineer with recognized expertise in parking facility design and a determination that the proposed facility will satisfy off-street parking requirements as adequately as would a facility using standard ordinance dimensions. 
12.  Stacked Parking Space. In the case of single family dwelling units, two-family dwelling units and multifamily dwelling units of no more than four dwelling units, up to two parking spaces may be stacked front to back for each unit. For example, a single space forty feet long and nine feet wide could be provided to accommodate the parking for a two-bedroom unit. A stacked parking space shall not be used to meet minimum parking requirements, i.e., a stacked parking space will create two parking spaces but shall be counted as one required parking space. The city manager's office shall not approve stacked parking unless the developer provides reasonable information that stacking spaces does not interfere with traffic flow around the building and does not negatively impact emergency access to the building. 
D.  Drive-Thru and Vehicle Stacking Requirements. Vehicle stacking is the minimum required length of an on-site drive aisle necessary to allow for the movement of vehicles within a parking lot to a drive-up window service or other drive-through services without impeding the flow of traffic on-site and off-site. Stacking distance shall be measured from the point of service within a designated drive aisle. The required cumulative stacking distance may be distributed between accesses serving the site, provided a minimum stacking distance of twenty feet is provided at each access point.

3.  Repair and Service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with loading areas. 
4.  Utilization. Space allocated to any off-street loading space, accessory drives or aisles shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for any off-street parking or trash handling facilities. 
5.  Ingress and Egress. Each required off-street loading space shall be provided with a means of unobstructed ingress and egress to an alley or onto a public street wide enough to accommodate expected vehicles. Where such ingress and egress is made onto a public street, it shall be through driveways or openings that meet required standards. Permanent wheel stops or curbing shall be provided to prevent any vehicle using the loading area from encroachment either on the required front setback, side setbacks or adjacent property. 
6.  Off-Street Loading Requirements. The loading spaces shall be indicated on site plans submitted for approval. The city manager's office may require one or more additional loading areas if the magnitude of the use would anticipate the need for more loading or standing space. Loading spaces shall be at least ten feet in width by thirty-five feet in length with fourteen feet of vertical clearance. The size may be modified by the city manager's office where site or use conditions warrant changes to this standard. 
7.  Landscaping Requirements. Loading areas shall be screened from public streets and adjacent residentially used property in accordance with the landscaping requirements contained in Chapter 15.14.050, Landscaping and Screening Standards. 
8.  Exceptions. Loading area requirements may be waived by the city manager's office where the buildings abut a public alley in such a manner that operations can be conducted from the alley in accordance with applicable loading traffic and parking conditions.

(ii)  The proposed alternative landscape design is compatible with the character and ambiance of vegetation and environmental design traditional to Wyoming and interior Western communities. 
C.  General Provisions for Multifamily (Four or more Dwelling Units), Commercial, Institutional and Industrial Uses. 
1.  Landscaping Area Requirements. As identified in subsection 15.14.050.B., applicability, most development sites, excluding single family, two-family and multifamily developments (less than four dwelling units), shall be required to be landscaped pursuant to this subsection. A minimum of fifteen percent of the lot or parcel area, excluding the building(s) or use footprint, shall be landscaped in accordance with the requirements of this chapter (Equation: Landscaped area = .15 × (lot area - primary building and use footprint)). For the purposes of this section, use footprint shall include any outdoor storage or display areas. At least fifty percent of the required landscape area shall be placed so that it abuts the adjoining public street rights-of-way, excluding alleys. 
2.  Landscaping Treatments Not Counted. No area required to be landscaped shall include any artificial trees, plants, or turf, impervious surfacing, or any carpeting designed as a visual substitute for lawn or other groundcover. Areas devoted to pasture, farm crops or undeveloped areas of a lot or parcel shall not be considered landscaped for the purpose of fulfilling any landscape requirements. 
3.  Water-Conserving Landscaping. Low-water, drought-tolerant plants shall be used for all new landscaping. Plant materials shall be selected from the plant list maintained by the city. The city plant list may be found in the administrative manual. Materials not on the list may be approved if it is determined that they are equally suitable for local soil conditions and climate and would provide the same level of visual benefits and have the desired growth habits. 
4.  Xeriscape/Water Conserving Landscaping Option. Xeriscaping improves aesthetic appearance and mitigates water usage. A xeriscape option is set forth as an alternative to conventional landscaping requirements. A xeriscape plan shall include the following: 
a.  Low-water, drought-tolerant plant materials shall make up eighty-five percent of all plant materials used and shall be selected from the Recommended Trees and Shrubs for Laramie, Wyoming list maintained by the city. Alternative plant materials may be approved if it is determined through alternative equivalent compliance (subsection 15.06.060.K.) that the alternative plan satisfactorily meets the intent of this chapter, that proposed plantings are equally suitable for local soil conditions and climate, would provide the same level of visual benefits and have the same desired growth habits. 
b.  Shall be prepared and signed/sealed by a licensed landscape architect. 
c.  All required landscaped areas shall contain a minimum of forty-five percent living organic landscape material and no more than twenty-five percent planted turf grass. 
5.  Cover in Landscaped Areas. All required landscaped areas shall contain: 
a.  A minimum of sixty-five percent living organic landscaping material, with a maximum of thirty-five percent nonliving landscaping materials.

c.  At a minimum, twenty-five percent of the required living landscaping shall be planted adjacent to each street frontage associated with the site. 
6.  Irrigation Systems for Landscaped Areas. All required landscaping and landscape areas shall include a permanently installed irrigation system unless the city manager's office determines that the planting and maintenance plan is not dependent on a permanent system. Such alternative determination shall be specifically approved by the city manager's office. Applicable irrigation plans shall be submitted with the site plan as required by subsection 15.06.060.O. 
7.  Maintenance. The responsibility for the maintenance of landscaping shall lie with the property owner, his/her successor and/or their agents. All landscaping elements shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition and, whenever necessary, replaced with new plant materials to ensure continued compliance with these standards. All required landscaped areas shall be kept free of weeds, debris, and litter. In addition, all walls and fences shall be maintained in good condition, and when necessary, be repaired or replaced. Any required landscape material, including any tree, grass or shrubs, that dies shall be replaced by September 30 of each year. All required landscaping shall be cleared of all unplanned vegetation including weeds at least once each year prior to September 30. 
8.  Landscaping Plan Preparation. For all multifamily (four or more units), commercial, institutional and industrial uses requiring site plan review and approval, a professional horticulturist, nurseryman, or design professional shall be consulted to determine the proper time to move and install all plant materials, so that stress to the plants will be minimized. All nursery stock shall generally conform to the ANSI standard for nursery stock. 
9.  Installation and Final Inspection. The planting of the required landscaping may be delayed for a period up to twelve months after issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy. Unless all such landscaping is installed, inspected and approved prior to issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy, a financial security for one hundred twenty-five percent of the landscaping materials and labor costs shall be required to be posted by the developer to ensure the placement of the required landscaping. All landscaping for multifamily, commercial, institutional and industrial uses requiring site plan review and approval shall be installed, inspected and approved by the city manager's office prior to certificate of occupancy issuance, per Chapter 15.18 (improvements) and other applicable section of this title. 
10.  Sight-Obscuring Fence. Chainlink or wire fencing shall be prohibited where a sight-obscuring fence is required in a bufferyard or landscaped area. (15.14.100, fences and walls.) 
11.  Utilities. All utilities within the exterior property lines of the site shall be installed underground. Freestanding utility boxes shall be integrated into the landscaping as much as possible and screened from view pursuant to [subsection] 15.14.050.H., screening standards. 
12.  Location of Landscaping and Measurement. All landscaping shall be located so that it does not interfere with utilities, easements, street lighting, or fire hydrants. The placement and design of the landscaping shall be generally at the discretion of the developer, but shall be approved by the city manager's office. The landscape area width is measured from the property line inward, unless alternatively approved pursuant to subsection 15.14.050.F.2.d. 
13.  Retention/Detention Ponds. Retention and detention ponds shall be landscaped and approved by the applicable decision making body. Landscaping shall ensure aesthetic appearance and screening of the facility, provide suitable grass mixes or plantings (ground cover) within the pond, provide suitable ground cover outside the pond as needed to ensure long-term stability of the structure, and shall prevent invasive plant species from growing with the retention/detention pond. Native species of shrubs and trees indigenous to the region shall be preferred over exotic plant species. 
D.  Landscaping Material Standards. 
1.  Plants to Conform. Plants shall conform to the measurements specified in the plant schedule submitted with the landscaping plan.

c.  Minimum size for shrubs shall be one-gallon or #1 container for low and medium shrubs and five-gallon or #5 container for tall shrubs. 
d.  Minimum sizes may be reduced at the discretion of the city manager's office where a developer proposes a reasonable alternative planting size and/or more landscaping or plantings than are required. 
3.  Trees. A mixture of canopy and ornamental trees shall be permitted. Generally, street frontage trees shall be canopy trees unless impractical and other tree types are approved by the city manager's office. 
E.  Residential Front Yard Landscaping. 
1.  Applicability. The front-yard areas between the building and back of curb within all new developments containing three or fewer dwelling units on lots or parcels less than sixteen thousand square feet in size shall be landscaped pursuant to this subsection. The landscaping shall be located within the entirety of the front yard between the front plane of the building or front fence(s), whichever is greater, and the roadway. For the purposes of calculating landscape area, driveways and sidewalks shall not be included. 
2.  Landscape Plan. A landscape plan shall be submitted with an application for a building permit and become part of the building permit. The landscape plan shall be approved prior to installation of the landscaping. Any modifications to the approved plan shall be reviewed and approved by the city manager's office. The plan shall include a calculation of landscaped areas and a list of proposed plant species. An underground irrigation system is recommended. 
3.  Installation and Final Inspection. The landscaping shall be completed by the developer, builder or property owner and inspected by the city manager's office prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The planting of the required landscaping may be delayed for up to twelve months past the certificate of occupancy. Failure to install the required landscaping within twelve months of issuance of a certificate of occupancy may result in a citation and fine issued by the city. 
4.  Gardenscape Option. 
a.  The required landscaping shall consist of at least seventy-five percent living ground cover. Up to fifty percent of the living ground cover area may be used for flower or garden beds, shrubbery planters or other similar accent features. At least two trees shall be planted in the front yard area. Trees may be a combination of evergreen and/or deciduous. At planting time evergreen trees shall be at least three feet tall. Deciduous trees shall be at least one and one-half inches caliper. Tree wells of five-foot diameter or less may be excluded from calculating the seventy-five percent living groundcover requirement. It is recommended that tree wells and other exposed planter areas be covered with organic material such as bark or mulch. 
b.  In order to reduce dust and soil erosion, any remaining area not covered by living groundcover shall be covered by materials such as bark, decorative rock or mulch. 
5.  Xeriscape Option. As an alternative to the gardenscape option identified above, xeriscape landscaping is permissible and shall be in compliance with the city's xeriscape guidelines. The design may include a mix of decorative rock, mulch, plants, and native grasses. A maximum of fifty percent of the front yard area may be without plants, but shall be covered with materials such as decorative rock, bark, or mulch. Plants species used shall be of appropriate variety to tolerate low watering and high altitude climate. 
6.  Modifications After Initial Installation. Landscaping may be modified by the property owner after initial installation without approval by the city manager's office, provided that the front-yard area remains landscaped, meets the purpose of this chapter and does not violate the provisions of Laramie municipal code Chapter 8.28. 
F.  Site Perimeter Landscaping. 
1.  Applicability. Site perimeter landscaping shall be provided along the perimeter property line of all multifamily (four or more dwelling units), commercial, institutional and industrial development sites except for approved points of pedestrian or vehicle access, in accordance with table 15.14.050-2 (see figure 15.14.050-1). Site perimeter landscaping shall not be defined as parking lot perimeter landscaping, which is provided for in subsection 15.14.050.G. 

Figure 15.14.050-1: Site perimeter landscaping is required on site perimeter of any commercial, institutional, industrial or multifamily development exceeding three dwelling units.

Reductions shall only apply to lots and parcels where any given building setback is less than the specific required perimeter landscaping width as shown in table 15.14.050.A. Reductions shall only apply to specific required site perimeter areas between the property line and proposed principal building. 
d.  The city may consider landscaping in the adjacent public right-of-way as a substitution for some or all of the required onsite street frontage landscaping, where in the judgment of the city manager's office the proposed public right-of-way landscaping meets the intent of this chapter. Any property owner requesting to landscape the public right-of-way as an alternative shall be required to maintain the landscaping into perpetuity unless the landscaped area is accepted for maintenance by the city. Such acceptance shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to subsection 15.06.060.K, alternative equivalent compliance. In addition to substituting for street frontage landscaping, public right-of-way landscaping may be substituted for other required landscaping if approved by the city manager's office. This may include the landscaping of public right-of-way or public lands within the city on a separate unrelated site in some cases where in the judgment of the city manager's office the public landscaping proposed will have significantly greater community benefit. 
3.  Specifications for Site Perimeter Landscaping. 
a.  In any area where site perimeter landscaping is required according to table 15.14.050-2, the planting requirements in table 15.14.050-3 shall apply. The amount of landscaping required in table 15.14.050-3 shall be measured per linear foot of property line or street frontage. Access driveways and pedestrian connections shall be subtracted from the linear frontage in calculations of the amount of landscaping required.

G.  Off-Street Parking Lot Landscaping. The following landscaping requirements shall be met for off-street parking lots for development that is not exempt from the landscape standards. 

Figure 15.14.050-2: Landscaped off-street parking lot. 
1.  Parking Lot Perimeter Landscaping. Perimeter parking lot landscaping (see Figure 15.14.050-2) shall be required for all parking lots having more than ten spaces where the parking lot is adjacent to a public street or a non-retail use such as a residential area, institutional use (e.g., hospital), or office, as provided below: 
2.  General Requirement. 
The parking lot perimeter landscaping requirement may be satisfied by complying with one of the following options: 
(i)  Option 1: L4 Screening as defined in table 15.14.050-3; or 
(ii)  Option 2: L3 separation as defined in table 15.14.050-3, with a maximum two-foot vehicle overhang area or no parking spaces adjacent to the landscaping. This option shall be available only to parking lots with fewer than 100 spaces, or if less than sixty percent of the parking spaces are located in the front parking area; or 
(iii)  Option 3: L2 buffer as defined in table 15.14.050-3, with no vehicle overhang or no parking spaces adjacent to the landscaping. This option shall be available only to parking lots with fewer than forty spaces, or if less than fifty percent of the parking spaces are located in the front parking area. 
(iv)  Option 4: Where lots are being developed under a common site/site plan, master site/site plan, or joint parking/circulation plan in a mixed-use district, the parking lot perimeter landscaping requirement may be waived along an interior lot line, providing that interior parking lot landscaping applies to both parking lots together. 
3.  Exceptions-Downtown Commercial and Technology and Office Zone Districts. 
(i)  Parking lot landscaping and screening requirements for lots and parcels in the DC district shall be required pursuant to subsection 15.08.030.E.2.c., development standards. 
(ii)  Parking lot landscaping and screening requirements for lots and parcels in the TO district shall be required pursuant to subsection 15.08.030.L.2.d, development standards. 
4.  Parking Area Trees Required. In addition to parking lot perimeter landscaping requirements of this subsection, there shall be one tree provided for every ten parking stalls. Trees may be placed within the parking areas or within twenty feet of the parking areas at the discretion of the developer, but shall be approved by the city manager's office. 

Figure 15.14.050-3: The use of landscape islands and terminal islands to define a parking area and provide shade and visual interest. 
5.  Internal Landscape Area. Internal landscape areas shall be required for any parking area creating ten or more parking stalls (see Figure 15.14.050-3). No landscape area shall be required for the first nine parking spaces. Twenty square feet of landscape area shall be required for each parking stall exceeding the first nine. For example, a parking lot with fifty-two stalls shall require no square feet for the first nine parking stalls and twenty square feet per stall for stalls ten to fifty-two [(total spaces-9) × 20 = square feet internal landscape required]. Internal landscape area shall be a combination of landscape or terminal islands. 
6.  Landscape Islands. The minimum width or length of any landscaped area shall be eight feet (see Figure 15.14.050-4). Each of the required landscaped areas shall contain a minimum of seventy-five percent living and irrigated landscaping material, with a maximum of twenty-five percent nonorganic landscaping material. Approved sidewalks shall not be not counted toward the non-living landscape material percentage. 

Figure 15.14.050-4: Minimum width of landscape islands is 8 feet. 
7.  Terminal Islands. The developer shall be required to utilize landscaped terminal islands at the end of each parking row. Divider strips between parking rows may also be used to help disperse the required landscaping throughout the entire parking lot. 
8.  Curbs. Landscaped areas within parking lots or along the perimeter of the property shall be protected from vehicular traffic through the use of continuous concrete curbs (see Figure 15.14.050-5). 

Figure 15.14.050-5: Protecting landscape areas with curbs. 
9.  Parking-Lot Clear Vision Area. Clear vision areas within the off-street parking area shall be established at street and/or drive aisle intersections by maintaining a maximum height for shrubs and ground cover of thirty inches. Within a clear vision area, tree branches shall be trimmed up to six feet from the ground. 
10.  Sidewalks as Divider Strips. A landscaped divider strip within a parking lot that separates either parking rows or parking lots shall be allowed to count a sidewalk located within this divider strip toward a part of the required off-street parking lot landscaping. The intent of this sidewalk is to help facilitate safe pedestrian movement. This sidewalk shall meet the following criteria if it is to be counted toward the required landscaping: 
a.  The sidewalk shall have a five-foot-wide walking path. Two feet for vehicle overhang shall be added for each abutting parking stall without curb stops. 
b.  The sidewalk shall run the entire length of the divider strip. 
c.  The sidewalk shall be bordered on at least one side by landscaping, of which the sidewalk shall not account for more than fifty percent of the area of the divider strip. 
H.  Screening Standards. 

Figure 15.14.050-6: Screening through site design and landscaping. 
1.  Screening of Service and Off-Street Loading Spaces. All service areas and off-street loading spaces on a site shall be screened from all public and private rights-of-way and adjacent uses (see Figure 15.14.050-6). Screening shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  To the maximum extent feasible, service and off-street loading areas shall not be visible from public streets. If a service or loading area is visible from a public street, approval of the planning commission shall be required. Off-street loading shall not include spaces for vehicles operated by the U.S. Postal Service or express-type package vehicles with three axles or less. 
b.  No service and off-street loading areas shall be located within twenty feet of any public street, public sidewalk, or internal pedestrian walkway. 
c.  Service and off-street loading areas shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. 
d.  Service areas not enclosed by a wall or fence shall be concealed by screening materials at least eight feet in height measured from the grade of the loading area. Such screening shall be provided by using one or more of the following methods; however, off-street loading spaces located adjacent to residentially zoned property shall use the method in subsection (iii) below. In addition, walls or fences used to screen a loading area that face a collector, minor and major arterial roads and interstates are required to follow the higher design standards found in [subsections] 15.14.100.D.5.a through 15.14.100.D.5.c. 
(i)  A combination of evergreen trees and shrubs that are planted in a double staggered row that provides the required screening (see Figure 15.14.050-7). 

Figure 15.14.050-7: A double staggered row of evergreens. 
(ii)  Masonry wall that matches the primary building (see Figure 15.14.050-8). 
(iii)  A combination of any two of the following: A six-foot ornamental metal fence, large evergreen-type screening shrubs, and/or berm. 

Figure 15.14.050-8: Service area screened by an eight-foot masonry wall. 
e.  When screening for service areas and off-street loading spaces is provided by earthen berm and/or plant materials, the following regulations shall apply: 
(i)  The berm shall have a minimum side slope of 3:1 and a minimum crown width of three feet. 
(ii)  Large evergreen-type shrubs shall be selected from the approved planting materials list and planted in accordance with specifications herein. In addition, the plant materials shall: 
(1)  Be located in a bed that is of a width suitable for the required plant spacing, but at least five feet wide. 
(2)  Be planted in staggered rows over the entire length of the bed unless the city manager's office approves an alternative planting density as being capable of providing a solid screen within one year of planting. 
(3)  Be a minimum of eight feet in height at time of planting and provides the required visual barrier. 
I.  Off-Street Utility, Dumpster, Recycling, Trash Handling and Recycling Facilities. 
1.  Location. All utility fixtures (including heating and air conditioning units), dumpsters, and trash handling facilities shall be located on the same lot as the use served unless shared facilities are approved by the city manager's office. A reciprocal written agreement assuring the perpetual joint usage of such common trash handling facilities shall be executed by the parties concerned and approved by the city attorney and the city manager's office. The agreement shall be recorded in the office of Albany County clerk and recorder. 

Figure 15.14.050-9: Dumpster enclosure. 
2.  Screening. 
a.  All utility, dumpster, and trash handling facilities - including the occupant's recycling facilities - shall be completely screened from public view and from the view of any development on any adjoining property. 
b.  A wall, solid fence, evergreen hedge, berm, or any combination thereof shall be provided to obscure these facilities. Obscuring architectural material(s) shall be consistent with those architectural materials found on site or the primary structure. 
c.  Dumpsters shall be located in masonry trash enclosures with gates hung on steel posts embedded in concrete (see Figure 15.14.050-9). 
d.  When the service side of the particular facility faces any property line without interruption by building or landscaping, a wall or solid wood fence with gates or doors shall be provided. Gates should be designed with a minimum twelve-inch clearance at the bottom and a mechanism for holding the gates open during trash collection. 
e.  The location and design of all trash facilities shall be submitted with the application for site plan approval or building permit, whichever is required first. 
f.  All required enclosures shall be a minimum of six feet high. 
g.  Screens shall not be required for dumpsters in nonresidential developments when located in the service area and screened by the buildings, wing wall or screening wall from public view. 
h.  Mechanical equipment shall be screened from view from public streets adjacent to the property at eye level (see Figure 15.14.050-10). This includes HVAC systems, other building mechanical apparatus, and satellite/ communication dishes. 
i.  All building projections that remain visible from abutting public streets after the screening required above, including but not limited to chimneys, flues, vents, gutters, and down spouts, shall match one of the predominant colors or trim colors used on the front façade of the building, or shall be constructed of materials such as brick or stone that match one of the predominant colors used on the front façade of the building. 
j.  All ground-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view and adjacent properties by adequate plantings, fencing, or masonry walls. 
k.  Freestanding utility boxes shall be integrated into the landscaping as much as possible and screened from view. 

Figure 15.14.050-10: Screening is required where service areas are visible. 
3.  Recycling. 
a.  At the discretion of the city manager's office and when recycling is available in Laramie, either through a government entity or commercially, public recycling drop off-sites shall be required for all subdivisions platted with twenty-five lots or greater (except for exempt single-family developments). Recycling drop off sites shall be required for all apartment complexes. Drop-off sites are encouraged and shall be permitted as an accessory use in all nonresidential zones. 
b.  The drop off site shall be kept free of litter, residue, and debris by the party responsible for the maintenance and management of the drop off facility. 
c.  Recycling centers shall be designed to be accessible to the public and shall be located so as to minimize disturbance to adjacent properties. The city manager's office shall review all proposed recycling centers and determine what type of screening shall be required. 
d.  The drop off site containers shall be durable, waterproof, covered and well maintained. The name and phone number of the party responsible for maintenance shall be posted on the container. Containers on the site shall have uniform colors. 
e.  The city manager or his/her designee may impose additional conditions if necessary to protect adjacent properties. 
4.  Access. All required dumpster, recycling, and trash handling facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of access to a street or alley in a manner that will least interfere with traffic or pedestrian movement, and that will most facilitate the service of the facilities. Access routes shall be approved by the city manager's office. 
5.  Utilization. Space allocated to any off-street dumpster and trash handling facilities shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street parking and/or loading facilities, nor shall any parking or loading spaces be used to satisfy the space requirements for any dumpster or trash handling facility.

15.14.060   Transportation, mobility, and connectivity.
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to: 
1.  Support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within Laramie in order to provide choices for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians; 
2.  Increase effectiveness of local service delivery; promote walking and bicycling; connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as employment, schools, parks, and shopping centers; 
3.  Reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel times; improve air quality; reduce emergency response times; 
4.  Mitigate the traffic impacts of new development, and free up arterial capacity to better serve regional long-distance travel needs. 
    These standards attempt to avoid the creation of large, isolated tracts without routes for through traffic or pedestrian and bicycle connections. 
B.  Traffic Impact Mitigation. 
1.  Applicability of Traffic Impact Analysis Requirement. The transportation system for new development shall be capable of supporting the proposed development in addition to the existing and future uses in the area. Evaluation of system capacity shall be undertaken through a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), that should consider the following factors without limitation: street capacity and level of service; vehicle access and loading; on-street parking impacts; the availability of transit service and connections to transit; impacts on adjacent neighborhoods; and traffic safety including pedestrian safety. A TIA shall be required with applications for development review and approval when: 
a.  Trip generation during any peak hour is expected to exceed two hundred fifty trips per day or more than one hundred trips during any one-hour peak period, based on traffic generation estimates of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual (or any successor publication); or 
b.  A TIA is required by the planning commission or city council as a condition of any land use application approved pursuant to the requirements of this code; or 
c.  The city manager's office, in its sole discretion, requires a TIA for: 
(i)  Any project that proposes access to a street with level of service "D" or below; 
(ii)  Any application for a rezoning or specific plan review; 
(iii)  Any case where the previous TIA for the property is more than two years old; 
(iv)  Any case where increased land use intensity will result in increased traffic generation; or 
(v)  Any case in which the city manager's office determines that a TIA should be required because of other traffic concerns that may be affected by the proposed development. 
C.  Traffic Impact Analysis and Development Review Process. 
1.  A scoping meeting between the developer and the city manager's office shall be required prior to the start of the TIA in order to determine the parameters of the study. This may be conducted as part of a pre-application meeting. The city manager's office shall define the TIA study in as limited a vicinity as is feasible to make adequate traffic determinations for the project. Where a larger boundary is necessary to make adequate traffic determinations, the city shall work with the applicant to provide traffic information and perform such modeling as is necessary to study the area outside of the project vicinity. 
2.  If required, the TIA shall be submitted with the applicable development application. 
3.  When access points are not defined or a site plan is not available at the time the TIA is prepared, additional studies may be required when a design review plan becomes available or the access points are defined. 

Figure 15.14.060-1: Speed table used as a traffic calming device. 
D.  Traffic Mitigation Measures. The applicant shall, as part of the TIA, recommend measures to minimize and mitigate the anticipated impacts and determine the adequacy of the development's planned access points. Mitigation measures shall be acceptable to the city manager's office and may include, without limitation: an access management plan; transportation demand management measures; street improvements on or off the site; placement of pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities on or off the site; or other capital improvement projects such as traffic calming infrastructure or capacity improvements (see Figure 15.14.060-1). 
E.  Streets and Vehicular Circulation. 
1.  Street Standards. All streets shall meet the standards of Chapters 15.16, Subdivision and 15.18, Improvements, and shall be consistent with the transportation element of the Laramie comprehensive plan and the city's adopted major street and highway plan (or successor plan), as applicable. 
2.  Street Connectivity. 
a.  Purpose. Street and block patterns should include a clear hierarchy of well-connected streets that distribute traffic over multiple streets and avoids traffic congestion on principal routes. Within each development, the access and circulation system should accommodate the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians through the development, and provide ample opportunities for linking adjacent neighborhoods, properties, and land uses. Local neighborhood street systems are intended to provide multiple direct connections to and between local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping. These connections should knit separate developments together, rather than forming barriers between them. 
b.  Local Residential Streets. 
(i)  Local residential streets shall be laid out so that use by through-traffic will be discouraged. Traffic-calming techniques such as diverters, neck-downs, street gardens, and curvilinear alignments are encouraged to reduce speeds and cut-through traffic. 
(ii)  Should topography or other constraints require the use of streets that extend more than six hundred feet without being punctuated by cross streets, a median, traffic-calming device, or similar feature shall be used to slow traffic and break-up the "runway" appearance. (See Figure 15.14.060-2.) Location, dimensions and design of such features shall be coordinated with required mid-block pedestrian connections (subsection 15.14.060.F.2.) so as to maximize pedestrian safety. 
(iii)  To the maximum extent practicable, streets shall be arranged to follow the natural contours of the site. 

Figure 15.14.060-2: Oblong median. 
c.  Vehicular Access to Public Streets, Public Access Easements, and Adjacent Land. 
(i)  All development shall provide public street connections to all existing, proposed or preliminary platted adjacent public streets. 
(ii)  If there are no adjacent public streets, subdivisions and/or site plans, the development shall provide for connections along each boundary abutting adjacent vacant land for future connections spaced at intervals not to exceed one thousand feet for arterials, or six hundred sixty feet for other street types, or as otherwise approved by the city manager's office. When connections to surrounding streets are proposed or required by the city, public rights-of-way shall be dedicated and streets developed to existing paved rights-of-way. The city may also require temporary turnarounds to be constructed for temporary cul-de-sacs between development phases. 
(iii)  No public right-of-way or public access easement shall be gated, have security-personnel stations or facilities, or have similar barriers installed, so as to restrict free vehicular access thereupon. This provision shall not apply to: (a) gates or barriers, temporary or permanent, installed under authority of public-safety agencies; (b) temporary street closures installed under authority of the city's right-of-way obstruction license (Section 12.08.090 et seq.) or special event permits (Chapter 12.60); (c) license agreements granted by city council; or (d) temporary closures required to perform infrastructure work or similar public-property maintenance duties (e.g., [Section] 12,20.010, [Section] 12,24.010 et seq. 
(iv)  Gate restricted access and similar physical access-control barriers and facilities shall be permitted across private driveways associated with non-residential developments; provided that: (a) all such barriers and facilities shall require approval by the city for public-safety and emergency access, including approval by the city fire marshall, prior to installation or operation; and (b) no gates or other access-restriction measures shall be installed across public right-of-way or access easements, except as may be permitted under [subsection] 15.14.060.E.2.c(iii) (vehicular access to public streets, public access easements, and adjacent land. 
d.  Cul-de-Sacs and Dead-End Streets Discouraged. 
(i)  The design of street systems shall use through-streets. Permanent cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets shall be used only when topography, the presence of natural features, and/or vehicular safety factors make a vehicular connection impractical. 
(ii)  All permanent dead-end streets shall be developed as cul-de-sacs and extend no further than six hundred sixty feet. 
(iii)  All cul-de-sacs shall conform to the requirements of the present adopted International Fire code. 
(iv)  Half streets (i.e., streets of less that the full right-of-way and pavement width) shall not be permitted except where such streets, when combined with a similar street (developed previously or simultaneously) on property adjacent to the development, creates or comprises a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements. 
(v)  Whenever cul-de-sac streets are created, at least one, twenty-foot-wide pedestrian access easement shall be provided, to the extent practicable, between each cul-de-sac head or street turnaround and the sidewalk system of the closest adjacent street or pedestrian pathway. This requirement shall not apply where it would result in damage to or intrusion into significant natural areas, such as stream corridors, wetlands and steep slope areas. The pedestrian access easement shall be dedicated to the city and maintained as part of the sidewalk system (see Figure 15.14.060-3). 

Figure 15.14.060-3: Cul-de-sac pedestrian connection. 
4.  Driveways and Access. 
a.  General. 
(i)  Every lot shall have access that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles, as well as for those needing access to the property in its intended use. 
(ii)  All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets shall be constructed so that: 
(1)  Vehicles may safely enter and exit from the lot in question; 
(2)  Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized; and 
(3)  The driveway is not less than twenty feet in length from the face of the garage or parking structure to the nearest street improvement. 
b.  Residential. In addition to the above general requirements, all residential development shall be subject to the following: 
(i)  Direct driveway access (ingress or egress) from any single-family residential lots to any arterial street or highway shall be prohibited on any lot preliminarily platted after the effective date of this code. 
(1)  Detached garages accessing alley right-of-way shall be accessed by a driveway measuring either: three feet in length from the right-of-way line, or a minimum of twenty feet in length from the right-of-way line. No garage shall be accessed by a driveway measuring between three feet and twenty feet in length from the alley right-of-way. 
(ii)  Multifamily development sites greater than five acres shall include a minimum of two through-access drives. An exception may be made by the city manager's office where a site is landlocked by existing development or other physical constraints, or where existing natural features on the site require the use of protective measures that would otherwise make a second access drive infeasible. 
(iii)  A minimum of one driveway access to a multi-family dwelling site shall be maintained with unobstructed vehicular access between the dwelling entrance(s) and the public street access. Gates capable of closure and similar barriers shall be specifically prohibited from installation or operation on such driveways. This section shall not prohibit secondary additional accessways to a multi-family development from having emergency-access-only gates or barriers, provided the design, installation and operation shall be approved by appropriate public-safety review entities, including the city fire marshall, for that purpose. 
(iv)  The provisions of subsection (iii) above shall also apply to driveways serving manufactured home communities ([Section] 15.14.140). 
c.  Nonresidential. In addition to the above general requirements, all non-residential development shall be subject to the following: 
(i)  All sites shall be designed so as to limit access to adjoining collector or arterial streets. 
(ii)  All nonresidential buildings, structures, and parking and loading areas shall be physically separated from all nonarterial or collector streets by vertical curbs and other suitable barriers and landscaping to prevent unchanneled motor vehicle access. Each property shall have not more than two access ways to any one street, unless unusual circumstances demonstrate the need for additional access points. In addition, each access way shall comply with the following: 
(1)  The width of any access way leading to an adjoining arterial street shall be median-divided to provide separation from incoming and outgoing traffic. (See Figure 15.14.060-4.) 
(2)  Curb returns shall have a minimum radius of thirty feet. 
(3)  On corner lots for nonresidential development, no part of any access way shall be nearer than seventy-five feet to the intersection of any two street rights-of-way. 

Figure 15.14.060-4: The width of access ways from arterial streets must be median-divided. 
(iii)  Each nonresidential driveway shall be not more than thirty feet in width, measured at right angles to the center line of the driveway, except as that distance may be increased by permissible curb return radii. Driveways that access state roads shall be not more than thirty-eight feet in width, and shall be divided by a landscaped island. Ingress and egress shall be one way on each side of the island. 
(iv)  Joint nonresidential driveways are desirable whenever possible in order to minimize the number of access points to streets and access easements (see Figure 15.14.060-5). 
(v)  Unless no other practicable alternative is available, all non-residential driveways and other openings shall be located a minimum of: 
(1)  Seventy-five feet from a street intersection; 
(2)  Forty feet from another access driveway; 
(3)  Ten feet from an interior property line for single family development and twenty feet from an interior property line for multifamily and non-residential development; and 
(4)  Ten feet from any mid-block pedestrian connection ([subsection] 15.14.060.F.2.d). 

Figure 15.14.060-5: Use of joint-access curb cuts to minimize curb cuts. 
5.  [Clear Vision Areas at Intersections.] On all corner lots or parcels of land on which a front setback is required, no obstruction that will obscure the view of road users shall be placed within the triangular area formed by the adjoining street right-of-way lines (property lines) and a line connecting them at points twenty-five feet from the intersection of said street right-of-way lines (property lines). Landscaping (excluding trees) and fencing shall be permitted within said triangular area provided the landscaping and fencing does not exceed three feet above the ground level of the adjacent street. Trees may be placed within said triangular area provided that limbs are trimmed to at least eight feet above the ground level of the adjacent street, so as not to significantly obstruct the view of road users approaching the intersection. 

Figure 15.14.060-6: No obstructions to view are allowed in the clear vision area. 
F.  Pedestrian Circulation. 

Figure 15.14.060-7: Sidewalk placement and landscaping. 
1.  Sidewalks Required. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all arterials, collector streets, and local streets (including loop streets and cul-de-sacs), and within and along the frontage of all new development or redevelopment. This requirement shall not apply to local streets in zoning districts in which the minimum lot size is one acre or greater, or in steep-slope areas where sidewalks on one side of the street may be approved by the city manager's office to reduce excessive slope disturbance, adverse impacts on natural resources, and potential soil erosion and drainage problems (see Figure 15.14.060-7). 
2.  Mid-Block Pedestrian Connections. On all new or newly extended residential streets with length greater than six hundred feet between the nearest pair of intersections, a mid-block pedestrian connection shall be provided on both sides of the street. Mid-block pedestrian connections shall: 
a.  Be located approximately equidistant from either intersection in the pair; 
b.  Be aligned directly across the subject street from each other; 
c.  Be located along property boundaries wherever possible; 
d.  Be located at least ten feet from the nearest driveway curb-cut, measured edge-to-edge at the street right-of-way; 
e.  Contain a minimum of twenty feet easement width, such easement to be dedicated for public pedestrian access, and minimum-width improved travel surface of five feet; 
f.  Connect at the farther ends to either: (i) a public street with sidewalk or similar pedestrian feature; or (ii) another public off-street pedestrian pathway; 
g.  Be delineated with a crosswalk across the street's travel surface; 
h.  Be provided with a street-center pedestrian refuge (e.g., accessible median or island) if located on streets with arterial or above status where existing or projected average daily traffic (ADT) is more than ten thousand vehicles. 
The city manager's office may grant an exemption from the mid-block pedestrian connection requirement for particular circumstances in which the connection poses a potential public risk, including but not limited to: Inadequate sight distance for vehicles and/or pedestrians; impossibility of present or future connection to other pedestrian travelways; or encroachment on a significant natural feature (e.g., stream channel, wetland, steep slope). 

Figure 15.14.060-8: On-site pedestrian connections that link to off-site development. 
3.  On-Site Pedestrian Connections. 
a.  All commercial, industrial, multifamily, mixed-use, and attached residential development shall provide a network of on-site pedestrian walkways with a minimum width of five feet to and between or among the following areas (see Figure 15.14.060-8): 
(i)  Public entrances to each commercial, industrial, multifamily, mixed-use, and/or attached residential building on the site, including pad site buildings; 
(ii)  Public sidewalks, walkways, or trails on adjacent properties that extend to the boundaries shared with the subject development; 
(iii)  Public sidewalks along the perimeter streets adjacent to the development; 
(iv)  Adjacent land uses and developments;

15.14.070   Parks and open space.
A.  Purpose. This section is intended to ensure that open space and natural areas throughout the city are provided, considered and protected during and after the development review process in accordance with the city of Laramie comprehensive plan, Chapter 4, Parks and Recreation. Open space serves numerous purposes, including preservation of natural areas and resources, preservation of scenic views, greater resident access to open areas and recreation, public health benefits, and enhancement of the quality of new development. 
B.  Public Park and Open Space Dedication and Fees In-Lieu. 
1.  Purpose. This subsection is intended to provide land or fees in-lieu of land for park and open space demand generated by new residential subdivisions. Particular emphasis should be placed on providing a diversity of parks that serve residents of all ages and abilities and that are accessible from a variety of locations within the community. Where no suitable land is available, based on subsection 15.14.070.B.4., characteristics of land to be dedicated, fees in-lieu of land or the equivalent monetary value may be substituted at the city's discretion, pursuant to subsection 15.14.070.B.8. 

Figure 15.14.070-1: Typical neighborhood park from the Laramie comprehensive plan. 
2.  Applicability. Any person applying for preliminary or final plat for development of any area zoned and to be used for single-family, two-family, or multifamily residential purposes in the city shall be required to dedicate for open space a portion of land per individual unit, or pay a fee in lieu thereof pursuant to subsection 15.14.070.B.8. based on the demand for open space created by the development. 
3.  Amount of Land to be Dedicated. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be determined based upon a finding by the city council that the land being dedicated is reasonably related to the impacts upon the city's parks and recreation system that will be generated by the residents and users of the subject development. 
a.  The amount of land dedicated shall not be less than 6.3 acres of park land per one thousand ultimate residents of the subdivision (based on national park standards). The following formula may be used as a general guideline for determining the amount of land (in acres) to be dedicated: 
6.3 acres × (No. of units) × (Persons per unit) = Area to be Dedicated 1,000  
b.  The distribution of this land shall generally be as follows: 
(i)  Playlots and/or community gardens: 0.3 acres/1,000 residents 
(ii)  Neighborhood Parks (see Figure 15.14.070-1) and/or community gardens: 1.0 acres/1,000 residents 
(iii)  Community Parks (see Figure 15.14.070-2): 5.0 acres/1,000 residents 
c.  The city council shall have discretion to re-allocate acreage among the above categories for the benefit of the community as well as for the creation of a large community park. 
d.  The city council finds that pursuant to the Laramie comprehensive plan, the following chart represents the average number of persons per unit by density category: 
Density Figures to be Used In Park Dedication Determinations Gross Density Per Residential Land Area Persons Per Dwelling Unit 0-6 dwelling units per acre 2.19 6-12 dwelling units per acre 2.19 Over 12 dwelling units per acre 2.19  
e.  The developer shall submit with each subdivision plat for residential development information concerning the number of units. Should the developer fail to do so, the city council shall assume the highest density allowed in the residential district. Such information may be required by the city manager's office at time of filing a site plan or a rezoning request. 
f.  An applicant seeking approval for a residential development application may submit an independent calculation of density and proposed parkland dedication. If approved by the city council, the independent calculation shall be used to calculate the required dedication. 

Figure 15.14.070-2: Typical community park from the Laramie comprehensive plan. 
4.  Characteristics of Land to be Dedicated. Except as otherwise required by the city council at the time of preliminary plat approval, all dedications of land under this section shall meet the following criteria: 
a.  Locational Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the subdivider, developer, or owner shall give priority to their preservation through public land dedication. In reviewing the proposed location of public land dedication areas, the city manager's office shall use all applicable plans, including the Laramie comprehensive plan, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (in no particular order): 
(i)  Flood hazard areas; 
(ii)  Lakes, rivers, stream/riparian corridors, and drainageways; 
(iii)  Wildlife habitat and migration corridors; 
(iv)  Tree or native plant retention areas; 
(v)  Ridgelines as identified in the Laramie comprehensive plan; 
(vi)  Conservation easements; 
(vii)  Trails as depicted in the Laramie comprehensive plan; and 
(viii)  Wetlands. 
b.  Number of Parcels. The dedicated park land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the city council determines that two or more parcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed development. In such cases, the city council may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least thirty feet in width. 
c.  Usability. At least fifty percent of the dedicated land required by this code shall be suitable for passive, active, or recreational open space. No part of such fifty percent to be used for passive, active, or recreational open space shall be within any designated detention pond, flood plain or floodway of the city. 
d.  Location Outside of Subdivision. At the discretion of the city council, the dedicated park land may be located outside of the residential development in order to comply with the comprehensive plan, to add property to existing park land, or to combine land dedication efforts with those of other developments. 
e.  Access. Public access to dedicated park land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or, if required by the city manager's office, by a dedicated public easement at least twenty feet wide that connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way, unless the land being dedicated is a sensitive environmental area to which access should be restricted for preservation purposes. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets shall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Public access to greenway/greenbelt dedications only shall be at least twenty feet wide. 
f.  Areas Not Eligible. Lands within the following areas shall not be accepted for public park or open space dedication: 
(i)  Private yards; 
(ii)  Public or private streets or rights of way; 
(iii)  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; and 
(iv)  Land covered by structures not intended solely for recreational uses. 
5.  Public Parks and Trails. The location and size of public parks and trails within the city shall be determined by the Laramie comprehensive plan or other appropriate plan. Parks shall have a minimum area and function as described in the Laramie comprehensive plan or other applicable plan. 
6.  Procedure for Dedication of Land. The dedication of such land shall be reviewed and approved as part of the preliminary and final plat. The developer shall designate on the preliminary and final plat the area or areas of land to be dedicated pursuant to this section. The director of parks and recreation shall be required, by his or her signature, to accept any lands for park or recreation use. The director of parks and recreation may refer the dedication to the city council. 
7.  Submission of Deed and Survey. Unless otherwise stipulated in a subdivision or development agreement, the conveyance of dedicated land to the city shall be by warranty deed, and the title shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, including real property taxes prorated to the time of conveyance. The owner shall provide the city with title insurance for the property. The deed shall be submitted no later than one year after the approval of the subject final plat, or by the time that fifty percent of the certificates of occupancy for that phase have been issued, whichever is earlier. 
8.  Payments of Fees In-lieu of Land Dedication. 
a.  Applicability. If a development would require, by virtue of subsection 15.14.070.B.3 above, less than five acres to be dedicated as park land, the developer shall be required to pay cash in-lieu of land in an amount determined as set out in this section unless the city council determines the land area to be dedicated has a positive impact to the park system. 
In instances where dedication is proposed or required, the city council shall have the right to refuse dedication of land, and instead, require payment of cash in-lieu of land as provided in this section if it determines that such dedication will not have a positive impact upon the park system, will not provide the necessary opportunities for the public, is unsuitable for public use, or other such reason determined by the city council. 
b.  Payment into Park Dedication Fund. In instances where payment of fee is to be made in lieu of land dedication, the money in lieu of land shall be paid into a fund established by the city. The cash payment shall be in an amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
c.  Administration of Park Dedication Fund. The park dedication fund will be administered by the city to provide a general benefit to contributing developments, provided that the establishment of all public parks shall be within the discretion of the city council. The money paid by the developer will be expended exclusively to establish park land that generally benefits the proposed development. The money shall be properly expended by the city or returned to the developer within twenty-five years of the date of final plat approval. The city shall account for all money deposited to the fund. All or part of the contribution may be expended for such purposes as acquisition of land, construction of improvements, and purchase of equipment for the relevant park. 
C.  Trail Linkages. 
1.  Trail linkages shall be incorporated into the design of all new subdivisions and multifamily and non-residential developments. Trail linkage shall be located and designed so as to provide public access, to connect residences and businesses to open space and the city's trail system, and to promote pedestrian and bicycle movement between residential areas and employment/business areas. 
2.  All development, at the time of platting, shall be required to demonstrate that the design of the proposed development includes open space and trail linkages pursuant to the Laramie comprehensive plan, Turner Tract area plan, or other applicable plan. 
3.  Trails shall be constructed at the time of development in accordance with city standards and specifications adopted by the city engineer. 
D.  Private Common Open Space. 
1.  Purpose. Private common open space is private open land area set aside for the exclusive use and enjoyment of a development's residents, employees, or users. Goals and requirements for common open space complement this code's requirements for dedicated parks, and serve similar purposes. 
2.  Applicability. Private common open space set-aside is an option available to residential developers with projects that have a minimum of twenty-five dwelling units. Should a developer opt to follow these provisions, the city may award up to a fifteen-percent reduction in the required public park and open space dedication or fee in-lieu of subsection 15.14.070.B. 
3.  Generally. All residential development in the city containing twenty-five or more dwelling units shall have the option to set aside a minimum of twenty percent of the total land area as private common open space. 
4.  District Specific. This option shall not be available where the standards of the specific zone district establish a different standard for open space dedication, such as the Downtown Commercial district. 
5.  Standards. 
a.  Location Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the subdivider, developer, or owner shall give priority to their preservation as private common open space. In reviewing the proposed location of private common open space areas, the city manager's office shall use all applicable plans, including the Laramie comprehensive plan, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order): 
(i)  Flood hazard areas; 
(ii)  Lakes, rivers, and stream/riparian corridors; 
(iii)  Wildlife habitat migration corridors; 
(iv)  Tree or native plant preservation areas; 
(v)  Trails as identified in the Laramie comprehensive plan; 
(vi)  Ridgelines as identified in the Laramie comprehensive plan 
(vii)  Wetlands; and 
(viii)  Private on-site stormwater detention facilities where the design has been approved by the city manager's office. 
b.  Areas Not Credited. Lands within the following areas shall not be counted towards private common open space set-aside areas: 
(i)  Private yards; 
(ii)  Public or private streets or rights of way; 
(iii)  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; and 
(iv)  Land covered by structures not intended solely for recreational uses. 
6.  Use of Common Open Space Areas. Private common open space areas shall not be disturbed, developed, or improved with any structures or buildings, except for the limited purposes allowed below: 
a.  Facilities for active recreation (equipment for such uses shall be indicated by type and location on the site and/or subdivision landscape/amenity plan provided by the developer); 
b.  Common open space areas may include passive recreational and educational purposes approved by the city, including but not limited to walking, biking, picnicking, fishing, preservation of natural areas and scenic resources, parks, environmental education, and wildlife habitat protection; and 
c.  Clearing of underbrush and debris and the provision of walks, fountains, fences, restrooms and similar features shall be allowed. 
7.  Design Criteria. Land set aside for private common open space shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant: 
a.  Common open space areas shall be located so as to be readily accessible and useable by residents in various positions of the development, unless the lands are sensitive natural resources and access should be restricted. A portion of the open space should provide focal points for the neighborhood. 
b.  The lands shall be compact and contiguous unless the land shall be used as a continuation of an existing trail, or specific topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the provision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor. 
c.  Where private common open space areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or developed, the private common open space shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing trail, park, or other open area land. 
8.  Ownership. All private common open space areas shall be owned jointly or in common by the owners of property within the development. 
9.  No Fee-In-Lieu. The payment of fees-in-lieu of the set-aside of land for private common open space uses shall be prohibited. 
10.  Private Open Space Maintenance. 
a.  The owner of the private open space land shall be responsible for maintenance. 
b.  For the purposes of this subsection, "maintenance" shall include control of noxious weeds, reseeding as needed to prevent erosion, restriction of use as necessary to allow revegetation, irrigation when appropriate, and the establishment and enforcement of reasonable rules for the protection of the open space. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-20-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 21, 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1728 , § 16, 4-18-2017; Ord. No. 1744 , § 24, 3-6-2018) 
15.14.080   Residential design standards.
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the residential design standards is to preserve the quality and character of the built environment in the city. More specifically, the purposes of this section are to: 
1.  Encourage high quality development as a strategy for investing in the city's future; 
2.  Emphasize the city's unique community character; 
3.  Maintain and enhance the quality of life for the city's citizens; 
4.  Shape the city's appearance, aesthetic quality, and spatial form; 
5.  Protect and enhance property values; 
6.  Provide property owners, developers, architects, builders, business owners, and others with a clear and equitable set of parameters for developing land; and 
7.  Promote the sustainability of both the structure and the overall community. 

Figure 15.14.080-1: Varied facades are preferred. 

Figure 15.14.080-2: Facades that do not meet design standards. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  The design standards in this subsection apply to all new detached and attached one- and two-family dwellings, townhouses, and accessory buildings. 
2.  Subsection 15.14.010.B.2.b., (applicability-redevelopment and infill development) provides information about how these provisions apply to redevelopment and infill development. In the case of exterior enlargement of an existing development (subsection 15.14.010.B.2.a.) or interior changes (subsection 15.14.010.B.3.), residential design standards shall not be mandatory for existing detached and attached one- and two-family dwellings, but shall apply in the case of townhouses. 
C.  Design Standards. 
1.  Facades. Developments containing twenty or more single-family detached and/or attached houses (aggregated if the development is phased) shall offer a minimum of four distinctly different front facades. Development containing thirty or more single-family detached and/or attached houses (aggregate if the development is phased) shall offer a minimum of six different front facades. The number of different front facades required shall increase by two for each addition of ten homes up to a maximum of twenty distinct facades. Mirror images of the same facade elevation are not considered distinctively different, with the exception of a two-family or similar attached dwelling (see Figures 15.14.080-1 and 2). 
a.  No facade shall be repeated more than once every four lots on the same side of the street, nor shall any facade be repeated on any two lots immediately across the street from each other. Each facade used to satisfy this requirement shall distinctly differ from other facades in a minimum of four of the following: 
(i)  Placement of windows and doors on the front facade; 
(ii)  Use of different materials on the front facade; 
(iii)  Substantial variation in the location and proportion of garages and garage doors; 
(iv)  Variation in the use, location, or proportion of front porches; 
(v)  Substantial variations in rooflines, that may include roof pitch; 
(vi)  Use of dormers; 
(vii)  Variation of building type between ranch, two-story or split level; 
(viii)  Window shapes that are substantially different; 
(ix)  Window grilles or shutters, or 
(x)  Other distinct and substantial facade design variations approved by the city manager's office. 
2.  Number of Units. No more than six single-family dwelling units shall be attached in any single row of townhomes. The attached single-family dwellings in any one row structure shall be required to have distinctly different facades (see Figure 15.1.4.080-3). No attached single-family structure facade shall be repeated more than once every four structures on the same side of the street. 

Figure 15.14.080-3: Multiple facades in an attached dwelling. 
3.  Massing. To the maximum extent practicable, the massing and use of exterior materials on attached single-family dwellings, not including townhouses, should be arranged so as to give the appearance of a large single-family house (see Figure 15.14.080-4). 

Figure 15.14.080-4: Example of single-family attached dwellings arranged as a large house. 
4.  Garages. 
a.  All single-family dwellings, in the LR and R1 districts shall have a garage. This requirement may be waived by the city manager's office for permanent affordable or work force housing. 
b.  In all zone districts-single-family dwellings (attached and detached) and duplex units with-garages, the street-facing garage shall be no more than twelve feet closer to the front property line than other elements of the structure. The following special setback provisions shall also apply: 
(i)  In the RR and LR Zoning Districts: A new single-family dwelling with attached garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to ten feet; provided however, that the front of the garage shall be set back by a compensating additional distance from the minimum, such that the additional garage setback is equal to or greater than the front-setback encroachment (see Figure 15.14.080-5). A new single-family dwelling with only a detached alley-facing garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to ten feet. 
(ii)  In the R1, R2, R2M, and R3 Zoning Districts: A new single-family dwelling or duplex unit with attached garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to five feet; provided however, that the front of the garage shall be set back by a compensating additional distance from the minimum, such that the additional garage setback is equal to or greater than the front-setback encroachment (see Figure 15.14.080-5). A new single-family dwelling or duplex unit with only a detached alley-facing garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to five feet. 

Figure 15.14.080-5: A front setback encroachment is allowed, provided however, that the front of the garage shall be set back by a compensating additional distance from the minimum front setback, such that the additional garage setback is equal to or greater than the front-setback encroachment and does not exceed the maximum encroachment allowed within that subject zoning district. 
c.  For single-family and single-story duplex dwellings with street-facing attached two-car garage doors shall not comprise more than forty-five percent of the façade width of each dwelling or eighteen feet of each dwelling, whichever is lesser (see Figure 15.14.080-6); and attached three-car garage doors shall not comprise more than fifty-five percent of the façade width of each dwelling or twenty-seven feet of each dwelling, whichever is lesser. This standard may be changed through a minor administrative modification process for pre-existing narrow lots. 
    For two-story duplex dwellings, street-facing attached two-car garage doors shall not comprise more than sixty-seven percent of the façade width of each dwelling or eighteen feet of each dwelling, whichever is lesser, provided that the second story living space projects over at least fifty percent of the garage width with a maximum offset of seven feet behind the face of the garage; and, at a minimum, the second story be at least the same width as the garage or greater than fifty percent of the structure; and attached three-car garage door shall not comprise more than sixty-seven percent. 

Figure 15.14.080-6: Street-facing, two-car garage doors shall not compromise more than 45 percent of the facade width or 18 feet, whichever is lesser. 
d.  The use of side-loading garages shall be permitted (see Figure 15.14.080-7.). The outside wall of a street-facing side-loading garage shall have a minimum of two of these design features: 
(i)  Siding materials identical to that found on the primary facade; 
(ii)  Two or more windows of a size and design similar to those found on the primary facade; 
(iii)  A permanent trellis covering a minimum of twenty-five percent of the wall area. One vine for every eight linear feet of trellis shall be planted at its base. Appropriate vine species are as approved by the city manager's office; or 
(iv)  Garage or living area facade offset from the other a minimum of four feet. 

Figure 15.14.080-7: Sample side-loading garage design.

3.  University Sign District. Any sign on University-owned or University-controlled property that does not contain a commercial message shall be considered a governmental or incidental sign and shall be exempt according to subsection C.2. Any sign containing a commercial message located on University-owned property, or along any public street contiguous to university-owned or university-controlled property, and intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way, unless otherwise exempt according to subsection C.2, shall: 
a.  Conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which the sign is located; and 
b.  Require approval of a sign permit as specified in subsection I. 
F.  Common Signage Plan. 
1.  Businesses located in a multi-tenant complex may submit a common signage plan that would contribute to uniformity in the complex's collective signage.

No application for a building permit for a new tower shall be processed until the applicant has met with the city manager's office before submitting the application, to review the feasibility of using an existing tower, structure, or a stealth tower. The applicant shall demonstrate that there is no existing facility that can reasonably accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna before the building permit application is processed. The city manager's office may require the applicant to make reasonable efforts to co-locate upon an existing tower. The city manager's office may require the applicant to make reasonable efforts to use a stealth tower. Collocation of facilities and/or stealth technology may be considered a mitigating factor to a conditional use request and may justify the request. 
4.  If an applicant claims that it cannot co-locate upon an existing tower, the applicant shall provide a written report from a Wyoming licensed engineer, qualified radio frequency expert, or other expert professional in support of its position. The city manager's office shall consider the written report in making its decision. 
5.  Any applicant who is aggrieved by the decision of the city manager's office concerning a building permit application may appeal the decision to the building code board of appeals.

15.14.170   Tree protection.
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the existing tree canopy as well as protect future tree canopies of the city when development or redevelopment occurs. The standards in this subsection are intended to regulate the removal of trees on lots within the city. It is not the intent of this subsection to unduly restrict desirable development and redevelopment that would otherwise be possible without these standards. 
B.  Applicability. The standards in this section shall be applied during review of any development or building permit applications on lots within the city of Laramie; provided, however, that development located in rear yards of lots with existing attached or detached single family dwellings shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. Emergency replacement or repair of existing water or wastewater lines necessary to provide continued service shall be exempt from this section. 
C.  Standards. 
1.  Preservation of Significant Trees. Significant trees shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. For the purposes of this standard, the caliper of a "significant" tree shall be at least twenty-four inches DBH for a deciduous tree and eighteen inches DBH for evergreens. 
a.  Significant Tree Replacement. 
(i)  Where significant trees cannot feasibly be preserved, the total caliper inches of the tree(s) that are removed shall be replaced by the same caliper inches of new trees. The new trees shall either be of the same or similar species, or, if identified by the city manager's office for species diversification, shall be from a list of permissible species provided by the city manager's office. 
(ii)  If site limitations affect the ability of the developer to replace the total caliper inches of the removed tree(s), the city manager's office may allow the developer to reduce the replacement measurement in an amount that allows for the maximum replacement of caliper inches feasible on the site. This reduction shall not exceed fifty percent of the total caliper inches removed. 
b.  Where the city manager's office reduces the number of trees planted in replacement of significant trees, the developer shall make a contribution to the city tree fund for the remaining caliper inches not replaced. The amount of the in-lieu fee shall be calculated as the cost to replace the remaining total caliper inches not planted with new trees of the same or similar species purchased wholesale at two-inch caliper DBH. 
c.  The city tree fund shall be used to maintain, replace or provide new trees within the city. 
2.  Enforcement. The city manager's office shall notify all development applicants reminding them of the significant tree replacement requirements at the time of pre-application or application, whichever occurs first. 
3.  Maintenance. Any new trees used to replace significant trees shall be maintained in accordance with LMC 15.14.050.C.7. For purposes of this subsection, the cited Landscaping and Screening maintenance subsection shall be deemed applicable to single-family properties. 
4.  Removal of a Dead or Dying Tree or Unsafe Tree. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a property owner to keep a dead or dying tree. The status of a tree shall be determined by the city manager's office prior to removal. The city may require a property owner to remove a dead or dying tree if it is determined to be a hazard to public safety. 
D.  Tree Protection During Construction. 
1.  Owner's Responsibility. During development, the owner or developer shall be responsible for the erection of any and all barriers necessary to protect any existing or installed trees from damage during construction in accordance with the standards of this subsection. 
2.  Tree Protection Fencing. 
a.  Where Required. All significant trees and trees intended for use as credit towards the landscaping and tree-protection standards of this code shall be fenced in accordance with this subsection before grading or other land-disturbing activity begins. Fencing shall extend at least one foot in distance from the edge of the tree for each inch of diameter at BREAST Height (DBH) to a maximum of ten feet, but in no case closer than five feet to the trunk. The city manager's office shall consider existing site conditions in determining the exact location of any tree protection fencing. 

Figure 15.14.170-1: Example of tree protection fencing at the edge of a tree's dripline. 
b.  Type of Fencing. The developer shall erect a temporary plastic mesh fence or temporary chain link fence a minimum of four feet in height at the drip line around each tree or group of trees to prevent the placement of debris or fill within the drip line of any tree. 
c.  Inspection. All tree protection measures shall be inspected and approved by the city manager's office prior to start of any land disturbing activities. Failure to have tree protection measures prior to the commencement of construction shall be a violation of this code. 
d.  When Required. The tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown on the site plan or grading permit. No construction, grading, equipment or material storage, or any other activity shall be allowed within the fenced area except in accordance with the standards in subsection 3. below, encroachments in to root zones. Fencing shall be maintained until the land disturbance activities are complete. 
3.  Encroachments into Root Zones. Encroachments within the root zones of trees protected in accordance with this subsection shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, the following preventive measures shall be employed prior to the encroachment: 
a.  Arborist Report. Written verification shall be prepared by an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist of the tree's condition before and after the encroachment, including preventive measures that shall be employed prior to, during, and after the encroachment to insure the viability of the tree. 
b.  Soil Compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the protection area, the area shall first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within the tree protection zone. 
c.  Effluent. In no instance shall any effluent associated with construction process, including concrete mixing, pouring, or rinsing processes, drain onto lands protected by tree protection fencing or other control measures. 
d.  Soil Compaction 
.  All tree protection activities during construction activities shall conform to current ANSI standards or exemptions prepared by a qualified ISA certified arborist.

15.14.180   Historic preservation
A.  Purpose. It is found and determined that certain areas, improvements, and districts within the city have a special character or special historic or aesthetic interest or value and represent architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the city, and that the areas, improvements and districts are in danger of being uprooted or having their distinctiveness destroyed without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss of the aesthetic, cultural, and historic values represented by such areas, improvements and districts, and therefore the preservation thereof is both feasible and desirable to the people of this city. It is declared as a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of such areas, improvements and districts of special character or special historic or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people of this city. 

B.  Demolition Controls for Historic Structures. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to: 
a.  Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of such areas and improvements and of districts which represent or reflect elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political, and architectural history. 
b.  Safeguard the city's historic, aesthetic and cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in such areas, improvements and districts. 
c.  Stabilize and improve property values in such districts. 
d.  Foster civic pride in the beauty and accomplishments of the past.

2.  Applicability. The standards of this subsection shall be applicable to the following structures: 
a.  Structures designated as a historic structure on the National Register of Historic Places 
b.  Structures designated as a historic structure on the Wyoming State Inventory of Historic Places; 
c.  Structures designated as a contributing structure to any National Register Historic District. 
3.  Demolition Restriction. No structure designated as a historic structure on the National Register of Historic Places, or on the Wyoming State Inventory of Historic Places, or is designated as a contributing structure to any national register historic district, shall be demolished unless the owner has first given the city at least six months notice of his or her intention to demolish the building. During that six-month period, the city shall work with the owner to identify any alternative uses that would allow the existing building to produce a better economic return that would allow it to remain in active use, or that would allow it to be used for the purposes or land uses the owner wants to achieve, or to identify a purchaser for the building who would preserve it from demolition. In the event the owner does not accept the alternatives, if any, offered by the city during that six-month period, the demolition may proceed, but only after the owner has provided at least thirty days additional time for the city or other parties to document the building through photographs or other means. The owner is encouraged, but not required, to allow access to the building during the thirty-day period in order to allow documentation of the interior of the building as well. 
4.  Maintenance. Property owners shall be required to maintain historic buildings and structures, as defined above, in a state of normal repair and not allow demolition by neglect. Demolition by neglect is the gradual deterioration of a building when routine maintenance is not performed. The city shall have authority to impose enforcement provisions on property owners who are found to have allowed a historic structure to fall into a state of neglect. 
5.  Neglect. Property owners of historic buildings and structures shall be required to keep them safe and fit for human habitation. The city shall have the authority to impose enforcement provisions on property owners who are found to have allowed an unsafe, insanitary, or dangerous condition to exist on their property. The provisions of subsection 15.08.030.E.3.c.(xiii), shall apply to any proposed demolition of such structure. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-20-2010) 
15.14.060 - Transportation, mobility, and connectivity. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to: 
1.  Support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within Laramie in order to provide choices for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians; 
2.  Increase effectiveness of local service delivery; promote walking and bicycling; connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as employment, schools, parks, and shopping centers; 
3.  Reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel times; improve air quality; reduce emergency response times; 
4.  Mitigate the traffic impacts of new development, and free up arterial capacity to better serve regional long-distance travel needs. 
    These standards attempt to avoid the creation of large, isolated tracts without routes for through traffic or pedestrian and bicycle connections. 
B.  Traffic Impact Mitigation. 
1.  Applicability of Traffic Impact Analysis Requirement. The transportation system for new development shall be capable of supporting the proposed development in addition to the existing and future uses in the area. Evaluation of system capacity shall be undertaken through a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), that should consider the following factors without limitation: street capacity and level of service; vehicle access and loading; on-street parking impacts; the availability of transit service and connections to transit; impacts on adjacent neighborhoods; and traffic safety including pedestrian safety. A TIA shall be required with applications for development review and approval when: 
a.  Trip generation during any peak hour is expected to exceed two hundred fifty trips per day or more than one hundred trips during any one-hour peak period, based on traffic generation estimates of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual (or any successor publication); or 
b.  A TIA is required by the planning commission or city council as a condition of any land use application approved pursuant to the requirements of this code; or 
c.  The city manager's office, in its sole discretion, requires a TIA for: 
(i)  Any project that proposes access to a street with level of service "D" or below; 
(ii)  Any application for a rezoning or specific plan review; 
(iii)  Any case where the previous TIA for the property is more than two years old; 
(iv)  Any case where increased land use intensity will result in increased traffic generation; or 
(v)  Any case in which the city manager's office determines that a TIA should be required because of other traffic concerns that may be affected by the proposed development. 
C.  Traffic Impact Analysis and Development Review Process. 
1.  A scoping meeting between the developer and the city manager's office shall be required prior to the start of the TIA in order to determine the parameters of the study. This may be conducted as part of a pre-application meeting. The city manager's office shall define the TIA study in as limited a vicinity as is feasible to make adequate traffic determinations for the project. Where a larger boundary is necessary to make adequate traffic determinations, the city shall work with the applicant to provide traffic information and perform such modeling as is necessary to study the area outside of the project vicinity. 
2.  If required, the TIA shall be submitted with the applicable development application. 
3.  When access points are not defined or a site plan is not available at the time the TIA is prepared, additional studies may be required when a design review plan becomes available or the access points are defined. 

Figure 15.14.060-1: Speed table used as a traffic calming device. 
D.  Traffic Mitigation Measures. The applicant shall, as part of the TIA, recommend measures to minimize and mitigate the anticipated impacts and determine the adequacy of the development's planned access points. Mitigation measures shall be acceptable to the city manager's office and may include, without limitation: an access management plan; transportation demand management measures; street improvements on or off the site; placement of pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities on or off the site; or other capital improvement projects such as traffic calming infrastructure or capacity improvements (see Figure 15.14.060-1). 
E.  Streets and Vehicular Circulation. 
1.  Street Standards. All streets shall meet the standards of Chapters 15.16, Subdivision and 15.18, Improvements, and shall be consistent with the transportation element of the Laramie comprehensive plan and the city's adopted major street and highway plan (or successor plan), as applicable. 
2.  Street Connectivity. 
a.  Purpose. Street and block patterns should include a clear hierarchy of well-connected streets that distribute traffic over multiple streets and avoids traffic congestion on principal routes. Within each development, the access and circulation system should accommodate the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians through the development, and provide ample opportunities for linking adjacent neighborhoods, properties, and land uses. Local neighborhood street systems are intended to provide multiple direct connections to and between local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping. These connections should knit separate developments together, rather than forming barriers between them. 
b.  Local Residential Streets. 
(i)  Local residential streets shall be laid out so that use by through-traffic will be discouraged. Traffic-calming techniques such as diverters, neck-downs, street gardens, and curvilinear alignments are encouraged to reduce speeds and cut-through traffic. 
(ii)  Should topography or other constraints require the use of streets that extend more than six hundred feet without being punctuated by cross streets, a median, traffic-calming device, or similar feature shall be used to slow traffic and break-up the "runway" appearance. (See Figure 15.14.060-2.) Location, dimensions and design of such features shall be coordinated with required mid-block pedestrian connections (subsection 15.14.060.F.2.) so as to maximize pedestrian safety. 
(iii)  To the maximum extent practicable, streets shall be arranged to follow the natural contours of the site. 

Figure 15.14.060-2: Oblong median. 
c.  Vehicular Access to Public Streets, Public Access Easements, and Adjacent Land. 
(i)  All development shall provide public street connections to all existing, proposed or preliminary platted adjacent public streets. 
(ii)  If there are no adjacent public streets, subdivisions and/or site plans, the development shall provide for connections along each boundary abutting adjacent vacant land for future connections spaced at intervals not to exceed one thousand feet for arterials, or six hundred sixty feet for other street types, or as otherwise approved by the city manager's office. When connections to surrounding streets are proposed or required by the city, public rights-of-way shall be dedicated and streets developed to existing paved rights-of-way. The city may also require temporary turnarounds to be constructed for temporary cul-de-sacs between development phases. 
(iii)  No public right-of-way or public access easement shall be gated, have security-personnel stations or facilities, or have similar barriers installed, so as to restrict free vehicular access thereupon. This provision shall not apply to: (a) gates or barriers, temporary or permanent, installed under authority of public-safety agencies; (b) temporary street closures installed under authority of the city's right-of-way obstruction license (Section 12.08.090 et seq.) or special event permits (Chapter 12.60); (c) license agreements granted by city council; or (d) temporary closures required to perform infrastructure work or similar public-property maintenance duties (e.g., [Section] 12,20.010, [Section] 12,24.010 et seq. 
(iv)  Gate restricted access and similar physical access-control barriers and facilities shall be permitted across private driveways associated with non-residential developments; provided that: (a) all such barriers and facilities shall require approval by the city for public-safety and emergency access, including approval by the city fire marshall, prior to installation or operation; and (b) no gates or other access-restriction measures shall be installed across public right-of-way or access easements, except as may be permitted under [subsection] 15.14.060.E.2.c(iii) (vehicular access to public streets, public access easements, and adjacent land. 
d.  Cul-de-Sacs and Dead-End Streets Discouraged. 
(i)  The design of street systems shall use through-streets. Permanent cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets shall be used only when topography, the presence of natural features, and/or vehicular safety factors make a vehicular connection impractical. 
(ii)  All permanent dead-end streets shall be developed as cul-de-sacs and extend no further than six hundred sixty feet. 
(iii)  All cul-de-sacs shall conform to the requirements of the present adopted International Fire code. 
(iv)  Half streets (i.e., streets of less that the full right-of-way and pavement width) shall not be permitted except where such streets, when combined with a similar street (developed previously or simultaneously) on property adjacent to the development, creates or comprises a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements. 
(v)  Whenever cul-de-sac streets are created, at least one, twenty-foot-wide pedestrian access easement shall be provided, to the extent practicable, between each cul-de-sac head or street turnaround and the sidewalk system of the closest adjacent street or pedestrian pathway. This requirement shall not apply where it would result in damage to or intrusion into significant natural areas, such as stream corridors, wetlands and steep slope areas. The pedestrian access easement shall be dedicated to the city and maintained as part of the sidewalk system (see Figure 15.14.060-3). 

Figure 15.14.060-3: Cul-de-sac pedestrian connection. 
4.  Driveways and Access. 
a.  General. 
(i)  Every lot shall have access that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles, as well as for those needing access to the property in its intended use. 
(ii)  All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets shall be constructed so that: 
(1)  Vehicles may safely enter and exit from the lot in question; 
(2)  Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized; and 
(3)  The driveway is not less than twenty feet in length from the face of the garage or parking structure to the nearest street improvement. 
b.  Residential. In addition to the above general requirements, all residential development shall be subject to the following: 
(i)  Direct driveway access (ingress or egress) from any single-family residential lots to any arterial street or highway shall be prohibited on any lot preliminarily platted after the effective date of this code. 
(1)  Detached garages accessing alley right-of-way shall be accessed by a driveway measuring either: three feet in length from the right-of-way line, or a minimum of twenty feet in length from the right-of-way line. No garage shall be accessed by a driveway measuring between three feet and twenty feet in length from the alley right-of-way. 
(ii)  Multifamily development sites greater than five acres shall include a minimum of two through-access drives. An exception may be made by the city manager's office where a site is landlocked by existing development or other physical constraints, or where existing natural features on the site require the use of protective measures that would otherwise make a second access drive infeasible. 
(iii)  A minimum of one driveway access to a multi-family dwelling site shall be maintained with unobstructed vehicular access between the dwelling entrance(s) and the public street access. Gates capable of closure and similar barriers shall be specifically prohibited from installation or operation on such driveways. This section shall not prohibit secondary additional accessways to a multi-family development from having emergency-access-only gates or barriers, provided the design, installation and operation shall be approved by appropriate public-safety review entities, including the city fire marshall, for that purpose. 
(iv)  The provisions of subsection (iii) above shall also apply to driveways serving manufactured home communities ([Section] 15.14.140). 
c.  Nonresidential. In addition to the above general requirements, all non-residential development shall be subject to the following: 
(i)  All sites shall be designed so as to limit access to adjoining collector or arterial streets. 
(ii)  All nonresidential buildings, structures, and parking and loading areas shall be physically separated from all nonarterial or collector streets by vertical curbs and other suitable barriers and landscaping to prevent unchanneled motor vehicle access. Each property shall have not more than two access ways to any one street, unless unusual circumstances demonstrate the need for additional access points. In addition, each access way shall comply with the following: 
(1)  The width of any access way leading to an adjoining arterial street shall be median-divided to provide separation from incoming and outgoing traffic. (See Figure 15.14.060-4.) 
(2)  Curb returns shall have a minimum radius of thirty feet. 
(3)  On corner lots for nonresidential development, no part of any access way shall be nearer than seventy-five feet to the intersection of any two street rights-of-way. 

Figure 15.14.060-4: The width of access ways from arterial streets must be median-divided. 
(iii)  Each nonresidential driveway shall be not more than thirty feet in width, measured at right angles to the center line of the driveway, except as that distance may be increased by permissible curb return radii. Driveways that access state roads shall be not more than thirty-eight feet in width, and shall be divided by a landscaped island. Ingress and egress shall be one way on each side of the island. 
(iv)  Joint nonresidential driveways are desirable whenever possible in order to minimize the number of access points to streets and access easements (see Figure 15.14.060-5). 
(v)  Unless no other practicable alternative is available, all non-residential driveways and other openings shall be located a minimum of: 
(1)  Seventy-five feet from a street intersection; 
(2)  Forty feet from another access driveway; 
(3)  Ten feet from an interior property line for single family development and twenty feet from an interior property line for multifamily and non-residential development; and 
(4)  Ten feet from any mid-block pedestrian connection ([subsection] 15.14.060.F.2.d). 

Figure 15.14.060-5: Use of joint-access curb cuts to minimize curb cuts. 
5.  [Clear Vision Areas at Intersections.] On all corner lots or parcels of land on which a front setback is required, no obstruction that will obscure the view of road users shall be placed within the triangular area formed by the adjoining street right-of-way lines (property lines) and a line connecting them at points twenty-five feet from the intersection of said street right-of-way lines (property lines). Landscaping (excluding trees) and fencing shall be permitted within said triangular area provided the landscaping and fencing does not exceed three feet above the ground level of the adjacent street. Trees may be placed within said triangular area provided that limbs are trimmed to at least eight feet above the ground level of the adjacent street, so as not to significantly obstruct the view of road users approaching the intersection. 

Figure 15.14.060-6: No obstructions to view are allowed in the clear vision area. 
F.  Pedestrian Circulation. 

Figure 15.14.060-7: Sidewalk placement and landscaping. 
1.  Sidewalks Required. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all arterials, collector streets, and local streets (including loop streets and cul-de-sacs), and within and along the frontage of all new development or redevelopment. This requirement shall not apply to local streets in zoning districts in which the minimum lot size is one acre or greater, or in steep-slope areas where sidewalks on one side of the street may be approved by the city manager's office to reduce excessive slope disturbance, adverse impacts on natural resources, and potential soil erosion and drainage problems (see Figure 15.14.060-7). 
2.  Mid-Block Pedestrian Connections. On all new or newly extended residential streets with length greater than six hundred feet between the nearest pair of intersections, a mid-block pedestrian connection shall be provided on both sides of the street. Mid-block pedestrian connections shall: 
a.  Be located approximately equidistant from either intersection in the pair; 
b.  Be aligned directly across the subject street from each other; 
c.  Be located along property boundaries wherever possible; 
d.  Be located at least ten feet from the nearest driveway curb-cut, measured edge-to-edge at the street right-of-way; 
e.  Contain a minimum of twenty feet easement width, such easement to be dedicated for public pedestrian access, and minimum-width improved travel surface of five feet; 
f.  Connect at the farther ends to either: (i) a public street with sidewalk or similar pedestrian feature; or (ii) another public off-street pedestrian pathway; 
g.  Be delineated with a crosswalk across the street's travel surface; 
h.  Be provided with a street-center pedestrian refuge (e.g., accessible median or island) if located on streets with arterial or above status where existing or projected average daily traffic (ADT) is more than ten thousand vehicles. 
The city manager's office may grant an exemption from the mid-block pedestrian connection requirement for particular circumstances in which the connection poses a potential public risk, including but not limited to: Inadequate sight distance for vehicles and/or pedestrians; impossibility of present or future connection to other pedestrian travelways; or encroachment on a significant natural feature (e.g., stream channel, wetland, steep slope). 

Figure 15.14.060-8: On-site pedestrian connections that link to off-site development. 
3.  On-Site Pedestrian Connections. 
a.  All commercial, industrial, multifamily, mixed-use, and attached residential development shall provide a network of on-site pedestrian walkways with a minimum width of five feet to and between or among the following areas (see Figure 15.14.060-8): 
(i)  Public entrances to each commercial, industrial, multifamily, mixed-use, and/or attached residential building on the site, including pad site buildings; 
(ii)  Public sidewalks, walkways, or trails on adjacent properties that extend to the boundaries shared with the subject development; 
(iii)  Public sidewalks along the perimeter streets adjacent to the development; 
(iv)  Adjacent land uses and developments; 
(v)  Adjacent public park, greenway, or other public or civic use; and 
(vi)  Adjacent public transit station areas, transit stops, park and ride facilities, or other transit facilities. 
b.  Internal pedestrian walkways shall be provided through parking areas in excess of fifty spaces, constructed of materials distinguishable from the driving surface pursuant to subsection 15.14.060.F.3.c., below. 
c.  Pedestrian walkways and crosswalks shall be identified to motorists and pedestrians through the use of one or more of the following methods, subject to department approval: 
(i)  Changing paving material, patterns, or paving color (see Figure 15.14.060-9); 
(ii)  Changing paving height; 
(iii)  Decorative bollards; 
(iv)  Painted crosswalks; 
(v)  Raised median walkways with landscaped buffers; or 
(vi)  Stamped asphalt. 

Figure 15.14.060-9: Change in paving materials to distinguish pedestrian walkway. 
d.  On-site pedestrian circulation routes shall be emphasized with special design features that establish them as areas where pedestrians are physically separated from the flow of vehicular traffic and/or are protected from the elements. Techniques shall include one or more of the following: 
(i)  Arcades, porticos, or other shade structures (see Figure 15.14.060-10); 
(ii)  Pedestrian light features, 
(iii)  Bollards, 
(iv)  Seat walls or benches;

(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-20-2010; Ord. No. 1625, §§ 14, 15, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 1671 , §§ 9-14, 21, 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1711 , § 2, 7-19-2016; ; Ord. No. 1728 , § 16, 4-18-2017; Ord. No. 1744 , § 24, 3-6-2018) 
15.14.070 - Parks and open space. 
A.  Purpose. This section is intended to ensure that open space and natural areas throughout the city are provided, considered and protected during and after the development review process in accordance with the city of Laramie comprehensive plan, Chapter 4, Parks and Recreation. Open space serves numerous purposes, including preservation of natural areas and resources, preservation of scenic views, greater resident access to open areas and recreation, public health benefits, and enhancement of the quality of new development. 
B.  Public Park and Open Space Dedication and Fees In-Lieu. 
1.  Purpose. This subsection is intended to provide land or fees in-lieu of land for park and open space demand generated by new residential subdivisions. Particular emphasis should be placed on providing a diversity of parks that serve residents of all ages and abilities and that are accessible from a variety of locations within the community. Where no suitable land is available, based on subsection 15.14.070.B.4., characteristics of land to be dedicated, fees in-lieu of land or the equivalent monetary value may be substituted at the city's discretion, pursuant to subsection 15.14.070.B.8. 

Figure 15.14.070-1: Typical neighborhood park from the Laramie comprehensive plan. 
2.  Applicability. Any person applying for preliminary or final plat for development of any area zoned and to be used for single-family, two-family, or multifamily residential purposes in the city shall be required to dedicate for open space a portion of land per individual unit, or pay a fee in lieu thereof pursuant to subsection 15.14.070.B.8. based on the demand for open space created by the development. 
3.  Amount of Land to be Dedicated. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be determined based upon a finding by the city council that the land being dedicated is reasonably related to the impacts upon the city's parks and recreation system that will be generated by the residents and users of the subject development. 
a.  The amount of land dedicated shall not be less than 6.3 acres of park land per one thousand ultimate residents of the subdivision (based on national park standards). The following formula may be used as a general guideline for determining the amount of land (in acres) to be dedicated: 
6.3 acres × (No. of units) × (Persons per unit) = Area to be Dedicated 1,000  
b.  The distribution of this land shall generally be as follows: 
(i)  Playlots and/or community gardens: 0.3 acres/1,000 residents 
(ii)  Neighborhood Parks (see Figure 15.14.070-1) and/or community gardens: 1.0 acres/1,000 residents 
(iii)  Community Parks (see Figure 15.14.070-2): 5.0 acres/1,000 residents 
c.  The city council shall have discretion to re-allocate acreage among the above categories for the benefit of the community as well as for the creation of a large community park. 
d.  The city council finds that pursuant to the Laramie comprehensive plan, the following chart represents the average number of persons per unit by density category: 
Density Figures to be Used In Park Dedication Determinations Gross Density Per Residential Land Area Persons Per Dwelling Unit 0-6 dwelling units per acre 2.19 6-12 dwelling units per acre 2.19 Over 12 dwelling units per acre 2.19  
e.  The developer shall submit with each subdivision plat for residential development information concerning the number of units. Should the developer fail to do so, the city council shall assume the highest density allowed in the residential district. Such information may be required by the city manager's office at time of filing a site plan or a rezoning request. 
f.  An applicant seeking approval for a residential development application may submit an independent calculation of density and proposed parkland dedication. If approved by the city council, the independent calculation shall be used to calculate the required dedication. 

Figure 15.14.070-2: Typical community park from the Laramie comprehensive plan. 
4.  Characteristics of Land to be Dedicated. Except as otherwise required by the city council at the time of preliminary plat approval, all dedications of land under this section shall meet the following criteria: 
a.  Locational Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the subdivider, developer, or owner shall give priority to their preservation through public land dedication. In reviewing the proposed location of public land dedication areas, the city manager's office shall use all applicable plans, including the Laramie comprehensive plan, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (in no particular order): 
(i)  Flood hazard areas; 
(ii)  Lakes, rivers, stream/riparian corridors, and drainageways; 
(iii)  Wildlife habitat and migration corridors; 
(iv)  Tree or native plant retention areas; 
(v)  Ridgelines as identified in the Laramie comprehensive plan; 
(vi)  Conservation easements; 
(vii)  Trails as depicted in the Laramie comprehensive plan; and 
(viii)  Wetlands. 
b.  Number of Parcels. The dedicated park land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the city council determines that two or more parcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed development. In such cases, the city council may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least thirty feet in width. 
c.  Usability. At least fifty percent of the dedicated land required by this code shall be suitable for passive, active, or recreational open space. No part of such fifty percent to be used for passive, active, or recreational open space shall be within any designated detention pond, flood plain or floodway of the city. 
d.  Location Outside of Subdivision. At the discretion of the city council, the dedicated park land may be located outside of the residential development in order to comply with the comprehensive plan, to add property to existing park land, or to combine land dedication efforts with those of other developments. 
e.  Access. Public access to dedicated park land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or, if required by the city manager's office, by a dedicated public easement at least twenty feet wide that connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way, unless the land being dedicated is a sensitive environmental area to which access should be restricted for preservation purposes. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets shall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Public access to greenway/greenbelt dedications only shall be at least twenty feet wide. 
f.  Areas Not Eligible. Lands within the following areas shall not be accepted for public park or open space dedication: 
(i)  Private yards; 
(ii)  Public or private streets or rights of way; 
(iii)  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; and 
(iv)  Land covered by structures not intended solely for recreational uses. 
5.  Public Parks and Trails. The location and size of public parks and trails within the city shall be determined by the Laramie comprehensive plan or other appropriate plan. Parks shall have a minimum area and function as described in the Laramie comprehensive plan or other applicable plan. 
6.  Procedure for Dedication of Land. The dedication of such land shall be reviewed and approved as part of the preliminary and final plat. The developer shall designate on the preliminary and final plat the area or areas of land to be dedicated pursuant to this section. The director of parks and recreation shall be required, by his or her signature, to accept any lands for park or recreation use. The director of parks and recreation may refer the dedication to the city council. 
7.  Submission of Deed and Survey. Unless otherwise stipulated in a subdivision or development agreement, the conveyance of dedicated land to the city shall be by warranty deed, and the title shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, including real property taxes prorated to the time of conveyance. The owner shall provide the city with title insurance for the property. The deed shall be submitted no later than one year after the approval of the subject final plat, or by the time that fifty percent of the certificates of occupancy for that phase have been issued, whichever is earlier. 
8.  Payments of Fees In-lieu of Land Dedication. 
a.  Applicability. If a development would require, by virtue of subsection 15.14.070.B.3 above, less than five acres to be dedicated as park land, the developer shall be required to pay cash in-lieu of land in an amount determined as set out in this section unless the city council determines the land area to be dedicated has a positive impact to the park system. 
In instances where dedication is proposed or required, the city council shall have the right to refuse dedication of land, and instead, require payment of cash in-lieu of land as provided in this section if it determines that such dedication will not have a positive impact upon the park system, will not provide the necessary opportunities for the public, is unsuitable for public use, or other such reason determined by the city council. 
b.  Payment into Park Dedication Fund. In instances where payment of fee is to be made in lieu of land dedication, the money in lieu of land shall be paid into a fund established by the city. The cash payment shall be in an amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
c.  Administration of Park Dedication Fund. The park dedication fund will be administered by the city to provide a general benefit to contributing developments, provided that the establishment of all public parks shall be within the discretion of the city council. The money paid by the developer will be expended exclusively to establish park land that generally benefits the proposed development. The money shall be properly expended by the city or returned to the developer within twenty-five years of the date of final plat approval. The city shall account for all money deposited to the fund. All or part of the contribution may be expended for such purposes as acquisition of land, construction of improvements, and purchase of equipment for the relevant park. 
C.  Trail Linkages. 
1.  Trail linkages shall be incorporated into the design of all new subdivisions and multifamily and non-residential developments. Trail linkage shall be located and designed so as to provide public access, to connect residences and businesses to open space and the city's trail system, and to promote pedestrian and bicycle movement between residential areas and employment/business areas. 
2.  All development, at the time of platting, shall be required to demonstrate that the design of the proposed development includes open space and trail linkages pursuant to the Laramie comprehensive plan, Turner Tract area plan, or other applicable plan. 
3.  Trails shall be constructed at the time of development in accordance with city standards and specifications adopted by the city engineer. 
D.  Private Common Open Space. 
1.  Purpose. Private common open space is private open land area set aside for the exclusive use and enjoyment of a development's residents, employees, or users. Goals and requirements for common open space complement this code's requirements for dedicated parks, and serve similar purposes. 
2.  Applicability. Private common open space set-aside is an option available to residential developers with projects that have a minimum of twenty-five dwelling units. Should a developer opt to follow these provisions, the city may award up to a fifteen-percent reduction in the required public park and open space dedication or fee in-lieu of subsection 15.14.070.B. 
3.  Generally. All residential development in the city containing twenty-five or more dwelling units shall have the option to set aside a minimum of twenty percent of the total land area as private common open space. 
4.  District Specific. This option shall not be available where the standards of the specific zone district establish a different standard for open space dedication, such as the Downtown Commercial district. 
5.  Standards. 
a.  Location Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the subdivider, developer, or owner shall give priority to their preservation as private common open space. In reviewing the proposed location of private common open space areas, the city manager's office shall use all applicable plans, including the Laramie comprehensive plan, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order): 
(i)  Flood hazard areas; 
(ii)  Lakes, rivers, and stream/riparian corridors; 
(iii)  Wildlife habitat migration corridors; 
(iv)  Tree or native plant preservation areas; 
(v)  Trails as identified in the Laramie comprehensive plan; 
(vi)  Ridgelines as identified in the Laramie comprehensive plan 
(vii)  Wetlands; and 
(viii)  Private on-site stormwater detention facilities where the design has been approved by the city manager's office. 
b.  Areas Not Credited. Lands within the following areas shall not be counted towards private common open space set-aside areas: 
(i)  Private yards; 
(ii)  Public or private streets or rights of way; 
(iii)  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; and 
(iv)  Land covered by structures not intended solely for recreational uses. 
6.  Use of Common Open Space Areas. Private common open space areas shall not be disturbed, developed, or improved with any structures or buildings, except for the limited purposes allowed below: 
a.  Facilities for active recreation (equipment for such uses shall be indicated by type and location on the site and/or subdivision landscape/amenity plan provided by the developer); 
b.  Common open space areas may include passive recreational and educational purposes approved by the city, including but not limited to walking, biking, picnicking, fishing, preservation of natural areas and scenic resources, parks, environmental education, and wildlife habitat protection; and 
c.  Clearing of underbrush and debris and the provision of walks, fountains, fences, restrooms and similar features shall be allowed. 
7.  Design Criteria. Land set aside for private common open space shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant: 
a.  Common open space areas shall be located so as to be readily accessible and useable by residents in various positions of the development, unless the lands are sensitive natural resources and access should be restricted. A portion of the open space should provide focal points for the neighborhood. 
b.  The lands shall be compact and contiguous unless the land shall be used as a continuation of an existing trail, or specific topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the provision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor. 
c.  Where private common open space areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or developed, the private common open space shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing trail, park, or other open area land. 
8.  Ownership. All private common open space areas shall be owned jointly or in common by the owners of property within the development. 
9.  No Fee-In-Lieu. The payment of fees-in-lieu of the set-aside of land for private common open space uses shall be prohibited. 
10.  Private Open Space Maintenance. 
a.  The owner of the private open space land shall be responsible for maintenance. 
b.  For the purposes of this subsection, "maintenance" shall include control of noxious weeds, reseeding as needed to prevent erosion, restriction of use as necessary to allow revegetation, irrigation when appropriate, and the establishment and enforcement of reasonable rules for the protection of the open space.

1.  The design standards in this subsection apply to all new detached and attached one- and two-family dwellings, townhouses, and accessory buildings. 
2.  Subsection 15.14.010.B.2.b., (applicability-redevelopment and infill development) provides information about how these provisions apply to redevelopment and infill development. In the case of exterior enlargement of an existing development (subsection 15.14.010.B.2.a.) or interior changes (subsection 15.14.010.B.3.), residential design standards shall not be mandatory for existing detached and attached one- and two-family dwellings, but shall apply in the case of townhouses. 
C.  Design Standards. 
1.  Facades. Developments containing twenty or more single-family detached and/or attached houses (aggregated if the development is phased) shall offer a minimum of four distinctly different front facades. Development containing thirty or more single-family detached and/or attached houses (aggregate if the development is phased) shall offer a minimum of six different front facades. The number of different front facades required shall increase by two for each addition of ten homes up to a maximum of twenty distinct facades. Mirror images of the same facade elevation are not considered distinctively different, with the exception of a two-family or similar attached dwelling (see Figures 15.14.080-1 and 2). 
a.  No facade shall be repeated more than once every four lots on the same side of the street, nor shall any facade be repeated on any two lots immediately across the street from each other. Each facade used to satisfy this requirement shall distinctly differ from other facades in a minimum of four of the following: 
(i)  Placement of windows and doors on the front facade; 
(ii)  Use of different materials on the front facade; 
(iii)  Substantial variation in the location and proportion of garages and garage doors; 
(iv)  Variation in the use, location, or proportion of front porches; 
(v)  Substantial variations in rooflines, that may include roof pitch; 
(vi)  Use of dormers; 
(vii)  Variation of building type between ranch, two-story or split level; 
(viii)  Window shapes that are substantially different; 
(ix)  Window grilles or shutters, or 
(x)  Other distinct and substantial facade design variations approved by the city manager's office. 
2.  Number of Units. No more than six single-family dwelling units shall be attached in any single row of townhomes. The attached single-family dwellings in any one row structure shall be required to have distinctly different facades (see Figure 15.1.4.080-3). No attached single-family structure facade shall be repeated more than once every four structures on the same side of the street. 

Figure 15.14.080-3: Multiple facades in an attached dwelling. 
3.  Massing. To the maximum extent practicable, the massing and use of exterior materials on attached single-family dwellings, not including townhouses, should be arranged so as to give the appearance of a large single-family house (see Figure 15.14.080-4). 

Figure 15.14.080-4: Example of single-family attached dwellings arranged as a large house. 
4.  Garages. 
a.  All single-family dwellings, in the LR and R1 districts shall have a garage. This requirement may be waived by the city manager's office for permanent affordable or work force housing. 
b.  In all zone districts-single-family dwellings (attached and detached) and duplex units with-garages, the street-facing garage shall be no more than twelve feet closer to the front property line than other elements of the structure. The following special setback provisions shall also apply: 
(i)  In the RR and LR Zoning Districts: A new single-family dwelling with attached garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to ten feet; provided however, that the front of the garage shall be set back by a compensating additional distance from the minimum, such that the additional garage setback is equal to or greater than the front-setback encroachment (see Figure 15.14.080-5). A new single-family dwelling with only a detached alley-facing garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to ten feet. 
(ii)  In the R1, R2, R2M, and R3 Zoning Districts: A new single-family dwelling or duplex unit with attached garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to five feet; provided however, that the front of the garage shall be set back by a compensating additional distance from the minimum, such that the additional garage setback is equal to or greater than the front-setback encroachment (see Figure 15.14.080-5). A new single-family dwelling or duplex unit with only a detached alley-facing garage shall be allowed to encroach into the required minimum front setback by up to five feet. 

Figure 15.14.080-5: A front setback encroachment is allowed, provided however, that the front of the garage shall be set back by a compensating additional distance from the minimum front setback, such that the additional garage setback is equal to or greater than the front-setback encroachment and does not exceed the maximum encroachment allowed within that subject zoning district. 
c.  For single-family and single-story duplex dwellings with street-facing attached two-car garage doors shall not comprise more than forty-five percent of the façade width of each dwelling or eighteen feet of each dwelling, whichever is lesser (see Figure 15.14.080-6); and attached three-car garage doors shall not comprise more than fifty-five percent of the façade width of each dwelling or twenty-seven feet of each dwelling, whichever is lesser. This standard may be changed through a minor administrative modification process for pre-existing narrow lots. 
    For two-story duplex dwellings, street-facing attached two-car garage doors shall not comprise more than sixty-seven percent of the façade width of each dwelling or eighteen feet of each dwelling, whichever is lesser, provided that the second story living space projects over at least fifty percent of the garage width with a maximum offset of seven feet behind the face of the garage; and, at a minimum, the second story be at least the same width as the garage or greater than fifty percent of the structure; and attached three-car garage door shall not comprise more than sixty-seven percent. 

Figure 15.14.080-6: Street-facing, two-car garage doors shall not compromise more than 45 percent of the facade width or 18 feet, whichever is lesser. 
d.  The use of side-loading garages shall be permitted (see Figure 15.14.080-7.). The outside wall of a street-facing side-loading garage shall have a minimum of two of these design features: 
(i)  Siding materials identical to that found on the primary facade; 
(ii)  Two or more windows of a size and design similar to those found on the primary facade; 
(iii)  A permanent trellis covering a minimum of twenty-five percent of the wall area. One vine for every eight linear feet of trellis shall be planted at its base. Appropriate vine species are as approved by the city manager's office; or 
(iv)  Garage or living area facade offset from the other a minimum of four feet. 

Figure 15.14.080-7: Sample side-loading garage design.

3.  University Sign District. Any sign on University-owned or University-controlled property that does not contain a commercial message shall be considered a governmental or incidental sign and shall be exempt according to subsection C.2. Any sign containing a commercial message located on University-owned property, or along any public street contiguous to university-owned or university-controlled property, and intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way, unless otherwise exempt according to subsection C.2, shall: 
a.  Conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which the sign is located; and 
b.  Require approval of a sign permit as specified in subsection I. 
F.  Common Signage Plan.

15.14.170   Tree protection.
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the existing tree canopy as well as protect future tree canopies of the city when development or redevelopment occurs. The standards in this subsection are intended to regulate the removal of trees on lots within the city. It is not the intent of this subsection to unduly restrict desirable development and redevelopment that would otherwise be possible without these standards. 
B.  Applicability. The standards in this section shall be applied during review of any development or building permit applications on lots within the city of Laramie; provided, however, that development located in rear yards of lots with existing attached or detached single family dwellings shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. Emergency replacement or repair of existing water or wastewater lines necessary to provide continued service shall be exempt from this section. 
C.  Standards. 
1.  Preservation of Significant Trees. Significant trees shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. For the purposes of this standard, the caliper of a "significant" tree shall be at least twenty-four inches DBH for a deciduous tree and eighteen inches DBH for evergreens. 
a.  Significant Tree Replacement. 
(i)  Where significant trees cannot feasibly be preserved, the total caliper inches of the tree(s) that are removed shall be replaced by the same caliper inches of new trees. The new trees shall either be of the same or similar species, or, if identified by the city manager's office for species diversification, shall be from a list of permissible species provided by the city manager's office. 
(ii)  If site limitations affect the ability of the developer to replace the total caliper inches of the removed tree(s), the city manager's office may allow the developer to reduce the replacement measurement in an amount that allows for the maximum replacement of caliper inches feasible on the site. This reduction shall not exceed fifty percent of the total caliper inches removed. 
b.  Where the city manager's office reduces the number of trees planted in replacement of significant trees, the developer shall make a contribution to the city tree fund for the remaining caliper inches not replaced. The amount of the in-lieu fee shall be calculated as the cost to replace the remaining total caliper inches not planted with new trees of the same or similar species purchased wholesale at two-inch caliper DBH. 
c.  The city tree fund shall be used to maintain, replace or provide new trees within the city. 
2.  Enforcement. The city manager's office shall notify all development applicants reminding them of the significant tree replacement requirements at the time of pre-application or application, whichever occurs first. 
3.  Maintenance. Any new trees used to replace significant trees shall be maintained in accordance with LMC 15.14.050.C.7. For purposes of this subsection, the cited Landscaping and Screening maintenance subsection shall be deemed applicable to single-family properties. 
4.  Removal of a Dead or Dying Tree or Unsafe Tree. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a property owner to keep a dead or dying tree. The status of a tree shall be determined by the city manager's office prior to removal. The city may require a property owner to remove a dead or dying tree if it is determined to be a hazard to public safety. 
D.  Tree Protection During Construction. 
1.  Owner's Responsibility. During development, the owner or developer shall be responsible for the erection of any and all barriers necessary to protect any existing or installed trees from damage during construction in accordance with the standards of this subsection. 
2.  Tree Protection Fencing. 
a.  Where Required. All significant trees and trees intended for use as credit towards the landscaping and tree-protection standards of this code shall be fenced in accordance with this subsection before grading or other land-disturbing activity begins. Fencing shall extend at least one foot in distance from the edge of the tree for each inch of diameter at BREAST Height (DBH) to a maximum of ten feet, but in no case closer than five feet to the trunk. The city manager's office shall consider existing site conditions in determining the exact location of any tree protection fencing. 

Figure 15.14.170-1: Example of tree protection fencing at the edge of a tree's dripline. 
b.  Type of Fencing. The developer shall erect a temporary plastic mesh fence or temporary chain link fence a minimum of four feet in height at the drip line around each tree or group of trees to prevent the placement of debris or fill within the drip line of any tree. 
c.  Inspection. All tree protection measures shall be inspected and approved by the city manager's office prior to start of any land disturbing activities. Failure to have tree protection measures prior to the commencement of construction shall be a violation of this code. 
d.  When Required. The tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown on the site plan or grading permit. No construction, grading, equipment or material storage, or any other activity shall be allowed within the fenced area except in accordance with the standards in subsection 3. below, encroachments in to root zones. Fencing shall be maintained until the land disturbance activities are complete. 
3.  Encroachments into Root Zones. Encroachments within the root zones of trees protected in accordance with this subsection shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, the following preventive measures shall be employed prior to the encroachment: 
a.  Arborist Report. Written verification shall be prepared by an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist of the tree's condition before and after the encroachment, including preventive measures that shall be employed prior to, during, and after the encroachment to insure the viability of the tree. 
b.  Soil Compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the protection area, the area shall first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within the tree protection zone. 
c.  Effluent. In no instance shall any effluent associated with construction process, including concrete mixing, pouring, or rinsing processes, drain onto lands protected by tree protection fencing or other control measures. 
d.  Soil Compaction 
.  All tree protection activities during construction activities shall conform to current ANSI standards or exemptions prepared by a qualified ISA certified arborist.

E.  Special Sign Districts. This section shall recognize three special sign districts: the Interchange Sign district, the I-80 Corridor Billboard Sign district, and the University Sign district. The intent of establishing these districts is to allow for special circumstances associated with these areas of the city. In the Interchange Sign district and the I-80 Corridor Billboard Sign district, the intent is to allow businesses to have larger and/or additional signage to accommodate greater speeds and the higher volume of traffic in these areas. In the University district, since most signs erected by the university are informational and directional, the intent is to establish guidelines for noncommercial and commercial signage erected by the university. 
1.  Interchange Sign District. 
a.  The Interchange Sign district zone shall be defined as the area including properties located within thirteen hundred feet of each of the interchanges, measured at right angles, from the Interstate 80 right-of-way line, beginning at the point where the right-of-way widens to accommodate the interchange and ending at the point where the right-of-way resumes its normal width. Where any property is split by the boundary so defined, the boundary shall extend beyond thirteen hundred feet to encompass the entirety of said property; provided, however, that the Interchange Sign district shall not exceed an absolute maximum distance of fifteen hundred feet from its associated interchange right-of-way boundary. 
b.  Total signage for a non-residential lot in the Interchange Sign district, except for off-premise directional signs and billboards, may exceed the underlying zoning district area and sign height limitations by up to two hundred percent. This allowance shall not apply in Residential (LR, R1, RR, R2, R2M, R3) Zoning districts. 
2.  I-80 Corridor Billboard Sign District. 
a.  The I-80 Corridor Billboard Sign district shall be defined as the area within five hundred feet of the Interstate 80 highway right-of-way boundary on either side, as measured perpendicular to the right-of-way. 
b.  Billboards as defined herein shall be permitted in the I-80 Corridor Billboard Sign district, subject to the following provisions: 
(i)  Billboards shall have a minimum spacing of a five-hundred-foot radius from any other billboard. For the purposes of measuring minimum spacing, measurements shall not extend across rights-of-way. 
(ii)  No billboard shall be placed in, or within one hundred fifty feet of, any Residential (LR, R1, RR, R2, R2M, R3) Zoning district boundary. 
(iii)  Billboards shall not exceed six hundred square feet of sign display area. 
(iv)  Billboards shall not exceed forty feet in sign height, measured from interstate highway grade to the top of the billboard structure. For purposes of this subsection, "interstate highway grade" is determined to be the point of highest elevation along a transect line running from the billboard's center across the full width of the Interstate 80 right-of-way, perpendicular to the nearest I-80 right-of-way boundary. 
(v)  Billboards shall be oriented to, and designed such that the display areas are primarily visible from, the Interstate 80 right-of-way. 
(vi)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the total square footage of billboard faces in the I-80 Billboard Sign district shall not exceed the square footage of billboard faces in the district on July 31, 2012; however, additional square footage shall be awarded as follows: 
(1)  A nonconforming billboard located outside of the Interstate 80 Corridor Billboard district shall be allowed to be relocated within the district. The total sign display area of the nonconforming billboard removed shall be multiplied by two and shall be added to the total allowable billboard sign display area within the district. 
c.  One pole-style freestanding sign per lot or parcel shall be permitted; provided, the sign is oriented perpendicular to the Interstate 80 right-of-way and shall not exceed forty feet in sign height, measured from interstate highway grade to the top of the sign structure. For purposes of this subsection, "interstate highway grade" is determined to be the point of highest elevation along a transect line running from the sign's center across the full width of the Interstate 80 right-of-way, perpendicular to the nearest I-80 right-of-way boundary. 
3.  University Sign District. Any sign on University-owned or University-controlled property that does not contain a commercial message shall be considered a governmental or incidental sign and shall be exempt according to subsection C.2. Any sign containing a commercial message located on University-owned property, or along any public street contiguous to university-owned or university-controlled property, and intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way, unless otherwise exempt according to subsection C.2, shall: 
a.  Conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which the sign is located; and 
b.  Require approval of a sign permit as specified in subsection I. 
F.  Common Signage Plan. 
1.  Businesses located in a multi-tenant complex may submit a common signage plan that would contribute to uniformity in the complex's collective signage. Signage permitted under a common signage plan may exceed the sign restrictions dictated by this ordinance by up to thirty percent. The common signage plan shall contain specific standards for consistency among all signs on the lots affected by the plan. Criteria for a common signage designation include but are not limited to: (A) color scheme; (B) lettering or graphic style; (C) lighting; (D) location of each sign on the building(s) or lot(s); (E) sign material; (F) sign proportions; and (G) cumulative sign display areas and heights of all signs. 
2.  Common signage plan signs that serve as a directory to a multi-tenant complex shall be monument signs or wall signs. Signage listed on a directory sign shall be considered monument or wall signage, as the case may be, and shall be calculated as part of a tenant's cumulative signage allowance. 
3.  Common signage plans shall require approval by the planning commission. The process for review and approval of a common signage plan shall be the same as the process for review and approval of a conditional use as specified in Chapter 15.06 of this title, provided that the planning commission shall review the common sign plan according to criteria (A) through (G) above.

15.14.170 - Tree protection. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the existing tree canopy as well as protect future tree canopies of the city when development or redevelopment occurs. The standards in this subsection are intended to regulate the removal of trees on lots within the city. It is not the intent of this subsection to unduly restrict desirable development and redevelopment that would otherwise be possible without these standards. 
B.  Applicability. The standards in this section shall be applied during review of any development or building permit applications on lots within the city of Laramie; provided, however, that development located in rear yards of lots with existing attached or detached single family dwellings shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. Emergency replacement or repair of existing water or wastewater lines necessary to provide continued service shall be exempt from this section. 
C.  Standards. 
1.  Preservation of Significant Trees. Significant trees shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. For the purposes of this standard, the caliper of a "significant" tree shall be at least twenty-four inches DBH for a deciduous tree and eighteen inches DBH for evergreens. 
a.  Significant Tree Replacement. 
(i)  Where significant trees cannot feasibly be preserved, the total caliper inches of the tree(s) that are removed shall be replaced by the same caliper inches of new trees. The new trees shall either be of the same or similar species, or, if identified by the city manager's office for species diversification, shall be from a list of permissible species provided by the city manager's office. 
(ii)  If site limitations affect the ability of the developer to replace the total caliper inches of the removed tree(s), the city manager's office may allow the developer to reduce the replacement measurement in an amount that allows for the maximum replacement of caliper inches feasible on the site. This reduction shall not exceed fifty percent of the total caliper inches removed. 
b.  Where the city manager's office reduces the number of trees planted in replacement of significant trees, the developer shall make a contribution to the city tree fund for the remaining caliper inches not replaced. The amount of the in-lieu fee shall be calculated as the cost to replace the remaining total caliper inches not planted with new trees of the same or similar species purchased wholesale at two-inch caliper DBH. 
c.  The city tree fund shall be used to maintain, replace or provide new trees within the city. 
2.  Enforcement. The city manager's office shall notify all development applicants reminding them of the significant tree replacement requirements at the time of pre-application or application, whichever occurs first. 
3.  Maintenance. Any new trees used to replace significant trees shall be maintained in accordance with LMC 15.14.050.C.7. For purposes of this subsection, the cited Landscaping and Screening maintenance subsection shall be deemed applicable to single-family properties. 
4.  Removal of a Dead or Dying Tree or Unsafe Tree. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a property owner to keep a dead or dying tree. The status of a tree shall be determined by the city manager's office prior to removal. The city may require a property owner to remove a dead or dying tree if it is determined to be a hazard to public safety. 
D.  Tree Protection During Construction. 
1.  Owner's Responsibility. During development, the owner or developer shall be responsible for the erection of any and all barriers necessary to protect any existing or installed trees from damage during construction in accordance with the standards of this subsection. 
2.  Tree Protection Fencing. 
a.  Where Required. All significant trees and trees intended for use as credit towards the landscaping and tree-protection standards of this code shall be fenced in accordance with this subsection before grading or other land-disturbing activity begins. Fencing shall extend at least one foot in distance from the edge of the tree for each inch of diameter at BREAST Height (DBH) to a maximum of ten feet, but in no case closer than five feet to the trunk. The city manager's office shall consider existing site conditions in determining the exact location of any tree protection fencing. 

Figure 15.14.170-1: Example of tree protection fencing at the edge of a tree's dripline. 
b.  Type of Fencing. The developer shall erect a temporary plastic mesh fence or temporary chain link fence a minimum of four feet in height at the drip line around each tree or group of trees to prevent the placement of debris or fill within the drip line of any tree. 
c.  Inspection. All tree protection measures shall be inspected and approved by the city manager's office prior to start of any land disturbing activities. Failure to have tree protection measures prior to the commencement of construction shall be a violation of this code. 
d.  When Required. The tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown on the site plan or grading permit. No construction, grading, equipment or material storage, or any other activity shall be allowed within the fenced area except in accordance with the standards in subsection 3. below, encroachments in to root zones. Fencing shall be maintained until the land disturbance activities are complete. 
3.  Encroachments into Root Zones. Encroachments within the root zones of trees protected in accordance with this subsection shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, the following preventive measures shall be employed prior to the encroachment: 
a.  Arborist Report. Written verification shall be prepared by an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist of the tree's condition before and after the encroachment, including preventive measures that shall be employed prior to, during, and after the encroachment to insure the viability of the tree. 
b.  Soil Compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the protection area, the area shall first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within the tree protection zone. 
c.  Effluent. In no instance shall any effluent associated with construction process, including concrete mixing, pouring, or rinsing processes, drain onto lands protected by tree protection fencing or other control measures. 
d.  Soil Compaction 
.  All tree protection activities during construction activities shall conform to current ANSI standards or exemptions prepared by a qualified ISA certified arborist.

15.14.180 - Historic preservation 
A.  Purpose. It is found and determined that certain areas, improvements, and districts within the city have a special character or special historic or aesthetic interest or value and represent architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the city, and that the areas, improvements and districts are in danger of being uprooted or having their distinctiveness destroyed without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss of the aesthetic, cultural, and historic values represented by such areas, improvements and districts, and therefore the preservation thereof is both feasible and desirable to the people of this city. It is declared as a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of such areas, improvements and districts of special character or special historic or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people of this city. 

B.  Demolition Controls for Historic Structures. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to: 
a.  Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of such areas and improvements and of districts which represent or reflect elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political, and architectural history. 
b.  Safeguard the city's historic, aesthetic and cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in such areas, improvements and districts. 
c.  Stabilize and improve property values in such districts.

3.  Demolition Restriction. No structure designated as a historic structure on the National Register of Historic Places, or on the Wyoming State Inventory of Historic Places, or is designated as a contributing structure to any national register historic district, shall be demolished unless the owner has first given the city at least six months notice of his or her intention to demolish the building. During that six-month period, the city shall work with the owner to identify any alternative uses that would allow the existing building to produce a better economic return that would allow it to remain in active use, or that would allow it to be used for the purposes or land uses the owner wants to achieve, or to identify a purchaser for the building who would preserve it from demolition. In the event the owner does not accept the alternatives, if any, offered by the city during that six-month period, the demolition may proceed, but only after the owner has provided at least thirty days additional time for the city or other parties to document the building through photographs or other means. The owner is encouraged, but not required, to allow access to the building during the thirty-day period in order to allow documentation of the interior of the building as well. 
4.  Maintenance. Property owners shall be required to maintain historic buildings and structures, as defined above, in a state of normal repair and not allow demolition by neglect. Demolition by neglect is the gradual deterioration of a building when routine maintenance is not performed. The city shall have authority to impose enforcement provisions on property owners who are found to have allowed a historic structure to fall into a state of neglect. 
5.  Neglect. Property owners of historic buildings and structures shall be required to keep them safe and fit for human habitation. The city shall have the authority to impose enforcement provisions on property owners who are found to have allowed an unsafe, insanitary, or dangerous condition to exist on their property. The provisions of subsection 15.08.030.E.3.c.(xiii), shall apply to any proposed demolition of such structure.

15.18.040 - Remedies. 
A.  Fault of Terms. In those cases where a security and improvement deferral acknowledgment has been executed and securities have been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of this code, the city may then: 
1.  Suspend plat or development plan approval or construction of a building or other private or public improvements until the improvements are completed, and record with the Albany County Recorder, a document to that effect for the purpose of public notice; 
2.  Obtain funds under the security and complete the improvements itself or through a third party; 
3.  Assign its right to receive funds under security to any third party, including a subsequent owner of the land to be divided or building constructed for which improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent owner's binding commitment to complete the required improvements; or 
4.  Exercise any other rights available under the law. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 15(Att. A), 11-18-2014) 
15.18.050 - Inspection and acceptance of public improvements. 
A.  Prior Responsibility. Prior to the commencement of any work, the developer shall obtain all required permits and pay all required fees, where applicable for the construction of required public and private improvements. No final plat shall be approved, nor shall site plan review be approved, nor shall building permits be issued, until all applicable permits are obtained and fees are paid. 
B.  Periodic City Inspection. City shall inspect improvements during and at the completion of construction of improvements. It shall in all cases be the responsibility of the developer to timely call for and schedule the appropriate inspections with the city manager's office. Failure to timely call for the applicable inspection, or failure to provide for unimpeded access or ability by the city or its designated inspecting agents to complete the applicable inspection, shall be grounds for failing the inspection and for rejection of the completed improvement or portion thereof. "Timely" in this section shall be defined as a minimum of twenty-four hours prior to inspection; provided that the city manager's office in its sole discretion may schedule an inspection less than twenty-four hours for cause shown If completed in accordance with the standards and specifications for such improvements, the city shall certify the improvements as being in compliance with city's standards and specifications. If upon the inspection, the city manager's office finds the construction performed to be in a satisfactory condition for inclusion in the completed project, the city manager's office shall issue a statement of inspection which shall permit the developer to perform the next phase of the construction. A final inspection by the city manager's office of all completed improvements shall be required before any improvements are accepted and before any final certificate of occupancy is issued. If it is determined upon inspection that any one or more of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the city's construction standards the developer shall be responsible for properly completing the improvements, or the city shall have the option to call the applicable security and cause the work to be completed per Section 15.18.040 (Remedies). 
C.  Notice of Completion. Upon inspection and acceptance of completed improvements by the city manager's office, the city manager's office shall issue to the developer a notice of acceptance. Improvements may be inspected and accepted in stages or phases, as may be determined appropriate by the city manager's office, provided that each completed stage or phase constitutes a functionally independent and separate stage or phase of the overall project. The dedication of applicable required public improvements shall not be accepted, nor shall the amount of any remaining security posted by the developer be reduced, until the city manager's office or other agency having jurisdiction over the improvements has issued a notice of acceptance stating that required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and accepted. 
D.  Developer Responsibility Until City Acceptance. The developer shall be responsible for the care and maintenance of all improvements until completion, inspection and acceptance by the city. During mobilization, construction, and demobilization, the developer shall keep the site free and clean from dangerous accumulation of rubbish and debris, and shall maintain sufficient and proper temporary traffic control devices in conformance with the MUTCD for the protection of the public. Final acceptance of the improvements shall not be made by the city until the construction areas and adjacent property has been cleared of all rubbish, surplus materials and equipment resulting from the contractor's operations, to the satisfaction of the city manager's office. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 15(Att. A), 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1728 , § 16, 4-18-2017) 
15.18.060 - Warranty of public improvements. 
A.  Two-Year Warranty. The developer shall warrant all public improvements for a period of two years from the date the city accepts via dedication or other appropriate instrument of a completed improvement or group of public improvements (the warranty period), and shall agree to replace or reconstruct any defective or otherwise unsatisfactory part or parts of the improvements without delay or cost to the city. 
B.  Financial Security. A financial security for the warranty period shall be posted or retained from the original security with the city for the warranted improvements. The amount of the security for the warranty period shall be twenty-five percent of the approved city engineer's estimate for the improvements. The posted twenty-five percent security may be reduced to twelve and one-half percent on or after the one-year anniversary date of the original posting of the security, upon written request of the developer and inspection and approval of the secured improvements by the City Manager's Office, with the difference to be refunded to the developer following approved inspection of the improvements. 
C.  Damages. The developer shall repair any damages to the improvements without cost to city before and during the warranty period due to private construction-related activities or defective work. If the improvements have been rejected by the city, the developer shall remove all damaged or defective work from the site and replace it with non-defective work. If developer fails to promptly repair or replace damaged or defective work, the city may at its option have the defective work corrected or the rejected work removed and replaced, and all direct and indirect costs of such removal and replacement, including compensation for professional services, shall be paid by the financial security for the warranty. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 15(Att. A), 11-18-2014) 
15.18.070 - Reduction of security for public improvements. 
A.  Reductions. The amount of security posted by the developer may be reduced by the ratio of the costs of public improvements completed by the developer and inspected and approved by the city. In no event shall the security be reduced to less than twenty-five percent of its original amount unless and until a warranty security or other form is posted for the warranty period. 
B.  Request. The request of reduction of the security shall be made in writing by the developer to the city manager's office. The request shall include an itemized list of public improvements that were completed by the developer and inspected and approved by the city for which the reduction of the security is being sought. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 15(Att. A), 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1728 , § 16, 4-18-2017) 
15.18.080 - Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
A.  Final Certificates of Occupancy. No final certificate of occupancy for any structure or facility shall be issued prior to the completion, inspection and acceptance of the required public and private improvements, as specific in this code and in applicable site plan review and building permit approval documents. 
B.  Temporary Certificates of Occupancy (TCO). 
1.  A temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) is hereby declared to be a privilege, not a right. 
2.  A temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) may be issued for a development prior to completion of non-fire and life/safety public or private improvements, provided that: (a) satisfactory city inspections have been completed for the applicable improvements; (b) appropriate full security has been provided to the city in accordance with this chapter; and (c) the applicable security and deferred improvement agreement has been executed and filed with the city. 
3.  In order to obtain a temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO), the developer shall submit to the city a financial security in the amount of one hundred fifty percent of the cost of remaining improvements, including labor and materials. For public infrastructure and for any other improvements that have been or are intended to be dedicated to the city, the basis for determining the security amount shall be the city engineer's estimate of cost. For on-site and similar improvements intended to be retained in private ownership or maintenance, invoices or similar confirmation of cost signed by the project contractor may be accepted by the city as the basis for security amount. 
4.  The following forms of security, and no others, shall be acceptable to the city of issuance of a TCO: cash; cashier's or certified check; letter of credit; or bond. 
5.  The city, at its discretion, may extend or renew the expiration date for any temporary certificate of occupancy; provided, however, that no temporary certificate of occupancy, whether original, new, extended or renewed, shall exceed one (1) calendar year from the date the initial temporary certificate of occupancy is issued by the city. No extension of the maximum one-year temporary certificate of occupancy period shall be granted. This one-year maximum is hereby declared not eligible for a variance under provisions of this Title. 
6.  For any project with a temporary certificate of occupancy with an original issuance date two hundred and seventy (270) calendar days prior, the city manager's office" shall issue a "Nine-Month Notice" on the next working day following the 270-day date, stating that: (a) the project has approximately three (3) months to complete all work, schedule and pass all inspections, and achieve all necessary city acceptances; (b) no [further] extensions of existing temporary certificates of occupancy shall be available nor shall any granted by the city; and (c) failure to complete work, pass inspection, and gain acceptance by the one-year anniversary of original TCO issuance shall be deemed prima facie grounds for the city to call the security and complete remaining work with the security funds. Failure by the city to provide the "Nine-Month Notice" shall not constitute grounds for waiving or extending the one-year deadline, nor shall it constitute grounds for delaying or waiving the process of calling the security and completing work under this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010; Ord. No. 1671 , § 15(Att. A), 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1744 , §§ 41-43, 3-6-2018)

Chapter 15.20 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1598, §§ 1, 2, adopted June 7, 2011, repealed the former Ch. 15.20, §§ 15.20.000-15.20.110, and enacted a new Ch. 15.20 as set out herein. The former Ch. 15.20 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), adopted March 2, 2010. 

15.20.010 - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
A.  Statutory Authorization. 
1.  The legislature of the state of Wyoming has in W.S. 15-1-601 et seq. delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of Laramie, Wyoming, does ordain as follows: 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Laramie are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
7.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
D.  Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 1598, § 2(att. A), 6-7-2011) 
15.20.020 - Definitions. 
A.  Terms. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
1.  "Alluvial fan flooding" means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
2.  "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
3.  "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one-percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
4.  "Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
5.  "Base flood" means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
6.  "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
7.  "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
8.  "Development" means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

10.  "Existing construction" means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
11.  "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
12.  "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
13.  "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
14.  "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

16.  "Floodplain" or "floodprone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
17.  "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
18.  "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
19.  "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
20.  "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
21.  "Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

d.  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
(i)  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(ii)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
25.  "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
26.  "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
27.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
28.  "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
29.  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
30.  "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
31.  "New construction" means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
32.  "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
33.  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
a.  Built on a single chassis; 
b.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
c.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
d.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
34.  "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
35.  "Special flood hazard area." See "area of special flood hazard." 
36.  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
37.  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
38.  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
39.  "Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
40.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully complaint with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
41.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the NAVD 88 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
(Ord. No. 1598, § 2(att. A), 6-7-2011) 
15.20.030 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. 
B.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Albany County and Incorporated Areas," dated June 16, 2011, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
C.  Establishment of a Development Permit. A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
E.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
F.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
G.  Warning and Disclaimer or Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
H.  Severability. This chapter is hereby declared to be severable. Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect and shall be read to carry out the purposes of the ordinance before the declaration of partial invalidity. 
(Ord. No. 1598, § 2(att. A), 6-7-2011) 
15.20.040 - Administration. 
A.  Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The city manager, or his or her designee, is hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management. 
B.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
3.  Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this chapter. 
4.  Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required. 
5.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. 
6.  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating agency which is the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
7.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
8.  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with [subsection] 15.20.030.B. the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of [Section] 15.20.050. 
9.  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
10.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (conditional letter of map revision). 
C.  Permit Procedures. 
1.  Application for a development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required: 
a.  Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed; 
c.  A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of [subsection] 15.20.050.B.2.; 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
e.  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with 15.20.040.B.1. 
2.  Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
b.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
c.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
d.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
e.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
f.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
g.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
h.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
i.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
j.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
D.  Variance Procedures. 
1.  The board of adjustment as established by the city shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
3.  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
4.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
5.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
6.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in [subsection] 15.20.040.C.2. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
7.  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter ([subsection] 15.20.010.C.). 
8.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
9.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
10.  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(i)  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
11.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria outlined in [subsections] 15.20.040.D.1. through 15.20.040.D.9. are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 1598, § 2(att. A), 6-7-2011) 
15.20.050 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
1.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
2.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
3.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
4.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
5.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
6.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and, 
7.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
B.  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in [subsections] 15.20.030.B., 15.20.040.B.8., or 15.20.050.C.3., the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in [subsection] 15.20.040.C.1.a. is satisfied. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
3.  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
4.  Manufactured Homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
(i)  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(ii)  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(iii)  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
(iv)  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of [subsection] 15.20.040.B.4.b.(iv) of this section be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot above the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
5.  Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM shall either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of [subsection] 15.20.040.C.1., and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in [subsection] 15.20.040.B.4. of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
C.  Standards for Subdivision Approvals. 
1.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with [subsections] 15.20.010.B., C., and D. 
2.  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of[subsections] 15.20.030.C.; 15.20.040.C.; and the provisions of [Section] 15.20.050. 
3.  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to [subsections] 15.20.030.B. or 15.20.040.B.8. 
4.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
5.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
D.  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in [subsection] 15.20.030.B., are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If [subsection] D.1. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of [Section] 15.20.050. 
3.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
E.  Below Grade Residential Crawlspace Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any below-grade crawlspace shall: 
1.  Have the interior grade elevation that is below base flood elevation no lower than two feet; 
2.  Have the height of the below-grade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall, not exceeding four feet at any point; 
3.  Have an adequate drainage system that allows floodwaters to drain from the interior area of the crawlspace following a flood; 
4.  Be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure and be capable of resisting the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads; 
5.  Be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
6.  Be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
7.  Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
8.  Be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two opening having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
F.  Standards for Zones without Base Flood Elevations and/or Floodway (A Zones). These standards apply in special flood hazard areas where streams exist but no base flood elevation data have been provided (a zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated. 
1.  When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been identified by FEMA in a flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this chapter. If data is not available from any source, only then the following provisions apply. 
a.  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or crawlspace) elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with the constructions standards in [subsections] 15.20.050.A. and 15.20.050.B.3. 
(Ord. No. 1598, § 2(att. A), 6-7-2011) 
15.20.060 - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than seven hundred fifty dollars or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city of Laramie from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 1598, § 2(att. A), 6-7-2011) 
Chapter 15.22 - NONCONFORMITIES 

15.22.000 - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and restrict uses, structures, lots, and signs that were established legally prior to the effective date of this code, that no longer conform to the requirements of this code or future code amendments. All such situations are collectively referred to in this chapter as "nonconformities." While nonconformities may continue, this chapter is intended to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and bring about their eventual elimination, in order to preserve and enhance the integrity of this code and the character of the city. 
B.  Authority to Continue. 
1.  Generally. Except as provided in this chapter, the lawful use and location of any structure, dwelling or land existing at the time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be continued even though the use or location does not conform to the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  Exception Due to Variances or Minor Modifications. Notwithstanding subsection B.1. above, this chapter shall not apply to any development standard or feature that is the subject of a variance or minor administrative modification granted under this code. Where a variance or minor modification has been granted that results in a development standard or feature that does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this code, that development standard or feature shall be deemed conforming. 
C.  Determination of Nonconformity Status. In all cases, the burden of establishing the existence of a legal nonconformity shall be solely upon the owner of the nonconformity, not the City. 
D.  Nonconformities Created Through Government Action. If a structure, use of land, use of structure, or characteristic of use does not comply with the requirements of this code solely as a result of an acquisition of land or other non-regulatory action by a government agency for a public purpose, then such structure, use of land, use of structure, or characteristic of use on land not acquired by the government shall be deemed conforming. 
E.  Change of Ownership or Tenancy. Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of property with an existing nonconformity are permitted, but such nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
F.  Maintenance and Minor Repair. Minor repairs or maintenance of nonconformities that are required to keep structures or sites in a safe condition are permitted, provided that the minor repair or maintenance does not increase the extent of nonconformity. For purposes of this section, "maintenance or minor repair" shall mean: 
1.  Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure; 
2.  Maintenance of land areas to protect against health and environmental hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses; and 
3.  Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety. 
G.  Nonconforming Parking Lots. 
1.  Any existing nonconforming parking lot containing ten or more parking spaces that is being reconstructed is subject to subsection 15.06.060.O (site plan). For purposes of this subsection, the term "reconstruction" shall include removal of asphalt and/or base or replacement of drainage facilities that necessitate removal of asphalt and/or base; provided, however, that minor repairs or maintenance as specified in subsection F shall not in and of themselves be deemed reconstruction so long as not more than twenty-five percent of the existing pavement surface area is removed to remedy the unsafe condition. In addition, reconstruction or repairs involving the removal of more than twenty-five percent of the existing pavement surface area within a non-conforming parking lot shall be subject to the following: 
a.  For reconstruction projects involving the removal and replacement of between twenty-five percent and fifty percent of the existing pavement area within a non-conforming parking lot, perimeter parking lot landscaping shall be required along any portion of the parking lot which fronts onto an adjacent street R.O.W. in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsection 15.14.050.G.2 (Landscaping and Screening Standards). 
b.  For reconstruction projects involving the removal and replacement of more than fifty percent but less than seventy-five percent of the existing pavement area within a nonconforming parking lot, perimeter parking lot landscaping shall be required along all sides of the parking lot in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsection 15.14.050.G.2 (Landscaping and Screening Standards). In addition, compliance with the stacking, striping and dimensional requirements for parking spaces set forth in Section 15.14.040 (Parking and Off-Street Loading) shall also be required. 
c.  Reconstruction of an existing nonconforming parking lot involving the removal and replacement of more than seventy-five percent of the existing pavement area shall require compliance with the stacking, striping and dimensional requirements for parking spaces set forth in Section 15.14.040 (Parking and Off-Street Loading) and the perimeter and internal landscaping requirements as specified in subsection 15.14.050.G. 
d.  In the event compliance with this section results in the loss of up to twenty percent of the number of existing or required spaces to serve a particular use or business as set forth in Table 15.14.040-3, relief may be sought under the minor administrative modification procedures as set forth in subsection 15.06.060.J.2.b.(i) . 
2.  An existing nonconforming parking lot shall be permitted to undergo refurbishment and shall not be required to comply with Sections 15.14.040 (Parking and Off-Street Loading) and 15.14.050 (Landscaping and Screening Standards). For purposes of this subsection, "refurbishment" shall be defined as any of the following: 
a.  Resurfacing over existing pavement, i.e., resurfacing that does not involve removal of pavement to the base layer; 
b.  Sealing or resealing existing pavement; 
c.  Restriping that does not change the number of parking spaces, ingress/egress locations or geometry, or interior vehicular circulation pattern. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010; Ord. No. 1625, § 23, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 1671 , § 21, 11-18-2014; Ord. No. 1699 , §§ 1, 2, 3-1-2016) 
15.22.010 - Nonconforming lots. 
    Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this code, a nonconforming lot may be developed with a permitted use on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code; provided, however, that the requirements specified in [subsection] 15.12.010.A.1.a. shall apply. Such lot shall be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.

15.22.020 - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Nonconforming Use of Structure. If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout parts of a structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such structure. 
3.  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
4.  When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for eighteen months, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
5.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal, or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
6.  A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a use of the same or less restrictive classification; a nonconforming use may, however, be changed to another use of a more restrictive classification. 
B.  Nonconforming Use of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, lawful uses of land exist that are no longer permissible under the terms of this code as enacted or amended, such uses may be continued, so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following provision: 
1.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code. 
2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part of any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code. 
3.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than eighteen months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this code for the district in which such land is located. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010) 
15.22.030 - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code that could not be built under the terms of this code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  Enlargement, Alteration, or Movement. 
1.  No such structure shall be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity unless the structure is located in the DC district and the planning commission determines that changes made to the structure that increase conformance with district and development standards provide an offset to changes that increase the nonconformity. 
2.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
B.  Damage or Destruction. Where a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed in part or in whole, it may be repaired or restored, provided a building permit for such repair or restoration is obtained within eighteen months. Expiration or abandonment of such building permit prior to completion shall have the effect of removing the structure's legally nonconforming status. 
(Ord. No. 1578, § 2(att. A), 3-2-2010) 
15.22.040 - Nonconforming signs. 
A.  Refer to subsection 15.14.120.H, Nonconforming and Abandoned Signs, of this title.

    The city manager's office shall have the following remedies and powers to enforce this title: 
A.  Civil Remedies and Enforcement Powers. 
1.  Deny/Withhold Entitlements. The city manager's office may deny or withhold all entitlements, including certificates of occupancy, or other forms of authorization to use or develop any land, structure, or improvements, until a violation, associated civil penalty, and/or lien resulting from a previous final order related to such property, use, or development is corrected. This provision shall apply whether or not the current owner or applicant for the permit or other approval is responsible for the violation. 
2.  Revoke Entitlements. Any entitlement or other form of authorization required under this title may be revoked when the city manager's office determines that: 
a.  There is a departure from the approved plans, specifications, limitations, or conditions as required under the entitlement; 
b.  The entitlement was procured by false representation; 
c.  The entitlement was issued in error; or 
d.  There is a violation of any provision of this title or other applicable regulations. 
Written notice of intent to revoke shall be served upon the property owner, agent, applicant, or other person to whom the entitlement was issued, or such notice may be posted in a prominent location at the place of violation. No work or construction shall proceed after service of the revocation notice. 
3.  Stop-Work Orders. 
a.  Whenever any building or structure or site or part thereof is being demolished, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in a hazardous manner, in substantial violation of any state or municipal building law, or in a manner that endangers life or property, the city manager's office has the authority to issue a stop-work order for the specific part of the work that is in violation or presents the hazard. 
b.  With or without revoking permits, the city manager's office may issue an order to stop work on any property on which there is an uncorrected violation of either a provision of this title or a provision of an entitlement or other form of authorization issued under this title. 
c.  The stop-work order shall be in writing directed to the person doing the work if known, and a copy mailed to the owner of record of the property, and shall specify the provisions of this title or other law allegedly in violation. After any such order has been posted, no work shall proceed on any building, other structure, or tract of land covered by such order, except to correct such violation or comply with the order. 
d.  The stop-work order may be issued at the same time as an enforcement order, or subsequent to such notice. The stop-work order may also specify a shorter time for correction of the violation than the time period specified in the enforcement order. The stop-work order shall also indicate that failure to comply with the order may subject the violator to civil and/or criminal liability as penalty for the violation(s). 
e.  Once conditions for resumption of the work have been met, the city manager's office shall rescind the stop-work order and shall notify the owner in writing of the rescission. 
f.  Issuance of a stop-work order may be appealed to the board of adjustment. The stop-work order shall remain in effect until the board takes final action on the appeal. 
B.  Civil Penalties. In addition to other remedies provided in section 15.26.030 or other sections of this Title, any person, firm or corporation, either as owner, lessee, occupant or otherwise, who violates any of the provisions of this division, or any amendment thereof, or who interferes in any manner with any person in the performance of a right or duty granted or imposed upon him by the provisions of this division, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $750.00. Each day during which such violation shall continue shall be deemed to be a separate offense. (Ord. 194 § 11.1, 1964) 
C.  Restoration of Disturbed Areas. The city manager's office may require a violator who is regulated under this title and who failed to retain sediment generated by a land-disturbing activity to restore the waters and lands affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation. This authority is in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty or injunctive relief authorized under this title or applicable law. 
D.  Injunctive Relief. The city manager's office may seek injunctive relief or other appropriate relief in district court against any person who fails to comply with any provision of this title or any requirement or condition imposed pursuant to this title. In any court proceedings in which the city seeks a preliminary injunction, it shall be presumed that a violation of this title is a real, immediate, and irreparable injury to the public; that the public will be irreparably injured by the continuation of the violation unless the violation is enjoined; and that there is no plain and adequate remedy at law for the subject title violation. 
E.  Abatement. The city may abate the violation pursuant to this subsection. 
1.  Before action is taken to abate a violation, a final warning notice shall be posted on the property and served personally or by certified mail with return receipt requested to the owner of record of the property. 
2.  Unless this notice is appealed to the board of adjustment within ten days of the posting of the final warning, the city manager's office shall proceed to abate the violation. 
3.  The city manager's office shall keep an account of the cost, including incidental expenses, incurred by the city in the abatement of any violation. The city manager's office shall forward a bill to the violator and owner of record of the property specifying the nature and costs of the work performed. For purposes of this section, the term "incidental expenses" shall include but not be limited to the actual expenses and costs to the city in the preparation of the notices, specifications and contracts, work inspection, and interest from the date of completion at the rate prescribed by law for delinquent real property taxes. 
4.  The responsibility for payment of the charges for abatement as set forth in this section shall rest solely upon the owners of the property upon which the abatement occurred. Such charges become a lien upon the real property upon which the violation was located. When charges for abatement remain unpaid after thirty days from billing, the city manager's office shall record a claim of lien at the county recorder's office. The lien shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property and shall be paramount to all other liens except for state or municipal property taxes, with which it shall be at parity. The lien shall continue until the charges and all interest due and payable thereon are paid. 
5.  The lien created under this section may be enforced pursuant to Wyoming law. The enforcement of the lien is a cumulative remedy and does not bar the collection of the charges for abatement or costs and attorney fees through an action against the person or persons who created, maintained, utilized, authorized, or expanded the violation. 
F.  Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided for violations of this title shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided by law, and may be exercised in any order.

15.26.040 - Procedures for enforcement actions. 
A.  Emergency Matters. In the case of a violation of this title that constitutes a public health or safety emergency, the city manager's office may use the enforcement powers available under this chapter without prior notice, but he or she shall attempt to give notice simultaneously with beginning enforcement action or as soon thereafter as possible. Notice may be provided to the property owner, agent, occupant, or to the applicant for any relevant entitlement and shall indicate the nature of the emergency. 
B.  Non-Emergency Matters. 
1.  Enforcement Orders. 
a.  In the case of a violation of this title that does not constitute an emergency matter as described in subsection 15.20.040.A., the city manager's office may issue an enforcement order pursuant to this section. The city manager's office may order: 
(i)  The discontinuation of a use of land or a structure that is in violation of this title; 
(ii)  The abatement or removal of a structure or part of a structure that is a violation of this title; 
(iii)  The discontinuation of construction or other activity preparatory to a structure or use of land or a structure that is a violation of this title; 
(iv)  The suspension or revocation of an entitlement issued under this title under the authority, or purported authority, of which a violation of this title is occupied, maintained, constructed, or established; 
(v)  The restoration of any structure, vegetation, land, water body, or other thing upon the land that is destroyed, damaged, altered, or removed in violation of this title; or 
(vi)  Any other action necessary to prevent, abate, or discontinue a violation of this title. 
b.  No penalty shall be assessed pursuant to this title unless and until the violator has been notified of the enforcement order in accordance with this section, with the exception of a violation of a stop-work order. 
c.  The enforcement order shall be in writing and shall describe the violation, shall identify the provision or provisions of this title that are being violated, shall specify what actions must be taken to correct the violation (including an order to stop any and all work which violates this title), shall direct the person to correct the violation within a specified reasonable time period (beginning on the date such notice is received) and shall warn that more severe measures (such as a civil penalty or criminal prosecution) may be assessed or brought against the violator if he or she fails to take appropriate action to cure or correct the violation. If no other violator can be ascertained, then the notice of violation shall be sent to the record owner of the land on which the violation occurs. 
d.  An enforcement order issued under subsection B.1.a. above may be directed to one or more violators. An enforcement order that is served on a violator personally or by certified mail is final with respect to that violator if not appealed to the board of adjustment within thirty days of its service. 
e.  An enforcement order need not be issued before other legal action is commenced with respect to a violation of this title. The pendency of any proceeding regarding an enforcement order issued under this section does not stay any other legal action with respect to the violation that is the subject of the enforcement order. 
2.  Extension of Time to Cure or Correct Violation. Upon receipt of a written request from the alleged violator or the property owner for an extension of time to cure or correct the violation, the city manager's office may grant a single extension of time in which the alleged violator may cure or correct the violation before the city manager's office pursues any of the forms of relief or penalties listed in Section 15.20.030, remedies and penalties. Such extension of time shall not be granted unless the alleged violator or the property owner can demonstrate to the city manager's office that the violation cannot be cured or corrected within the time period specified. 
3.  Corrective Action Taken. If the violation is cured or corrected within the time period specified in the enforcement order, or within the extension of time granted, then the city shall take no further action against the violator. 
4.  Options Upon Noncompliance. Whenever a written enforcement order has become final, as specified in subsection B.1.d. above, and the violation continues to exist, the city manager's office may: 
a.  Pursue any of the forms of relief under Section 15.20.040, remedies and penalties; or 
b.  Assess an administrative fine, not exceeding seven hundred and fifty dollars per day, for failure to comply with a final enforcement order.

3.8  Aerial and Underground Construction. In the Service Area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided, that facilities are capable of receiving the Grantee's cable and other equipment without technical degradation of the Cable System's signal quality. In areas where the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are both aerial and underground, the Grantee has the sole discretion to construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities, or any part, aerially or underground. Nothing contained in this section will require the Grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as Subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related equipment.

C.  If the default cannot be cured within the thirty day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default as expediently as possible and notify the Franchising Authority of the steps being taken and the projected date that the default will be cured. 
7.3  Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice described in Section 7.1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 7.2, or if the alleged default is not remedied within thirty days or the date projected pursuant to 7.2(C) above, the Franchising Authority shall schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. The public hearing shall be held at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Franchising Authority which is no less than five business days after the expiration of the thirty-day period. The Franchising Authority shall notify the Grantee in writing of the time and place of such meeting and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard. 
7.4  Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal, state and local law, in the event the Franchising Authority, after such meeting, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of the Franchise, the Franchising Authority may: 
A.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to that remedy, as an alternative to damages; 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or 
C.  In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the Franchise, proceed under Section 7.5 to declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked. 
7.5  Revocation. If the Franchising Authority seeks to revoke the Franchise after following the procedures set forth in Sections 7.1-7.4 above, the Franchising Authority shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the Franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance by the Grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the Franchise. The notice shall set forth the nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee has ninety days from the notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for the objection. If the Franchising Authority has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee within the ninety days, it may seek termination of the Franchise at a public meeting. The Franchising Authority shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least ten days prior to a public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of the meeting and stating its intent to request the termination. 
At the designated meeting or any continuation or postponement thereof, the Franchising Authority shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the Franchise shall be revoked. 
The Franchising Authority may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the Franchising Authority's rights under the Franchise in lieu of revocation of the Franchise. 
7.6  Force Majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination, cancellation or revocation of the Franchise), where noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature, labor disputes, governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation, or other event that is reasonably beyond the Grantee's ability to anticipate and control. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which the Grantee's cable and/or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of materials or qualified labor to perform the work necessary that is reasonably beyond the Grantee's ability to anticipate and control. 
7.7  False Statements. Any false or misleading statement or representation in any report required by this Franchise, not including clerical errors or errors made in good faith, may be deemed a material breach of this Franchise and may subject the Grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to the Franchising Authority under this Franchise.

ENROLLED ORDINANCE NO. 1449 
  
INTRODUCED BY: Shuster 
  
AN ORDINANCE GRANTING TO CARBON POWER & LIGHT, INC., A WYOMING RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, A NONEXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND FRANCHISE TO CONSTRUCT, MAINTAIN AND OPERATE ALONG, ACROSS, ABOVE AND UNDER THE PRESENT AND FUTURE STREETS, ALLEYS, PUBLIC PLACES AND WAYS OF THE CITY OF LARAMIE, WYOMING, AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER SYSTEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPLYING ELECTRICITY AND ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THE CITY OF LARAMIE, THE INHABITANTS THEREOF, AND OTHERS; SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS ORDINANCE. 
  
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CITY OF LARAMIE: 
  
    Section 1. The City of Laramie, Wyoming (City), hereby grants to Carbon Power & Light, Inc., a Wyoming Rural Electric Cooperative authorized to do business in the State of Wyoming, and to its successors and assigns (Grantee), a nonexclusive right and franchise from and after the effective date of this ordinance, to construct, maintain, and operate along, across, above and under the present and future streets, alleys, public places and ways, (collectively referred to as streets), electric light and power transmission and distribution lines, with all necessary or desirable appurtenances, including underground conduits, poles, wires, and telephone wires (facilities), for the purpose of supplying electricity and electric service to the City, the inhabitants thereof, and persons and entities within and beyond the limits of the City within the territory certificated to Carbon Power & Light, Inc., by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, on the terms and conditions of this ordinance. 
    Section 2. The duration of this franchise is twenty-five (25) years from its effective date and continuing thereafter upon these same terms until another lawful franchise between the parties is enacted; provided that the City Council reserves the right at the end of each five (5) year period from and after the effective date to renegotiate the provision of this ordinance limited to the percentage of gross operating revenues demanded by the City with the Grantee, its successors or assigns in good faith, and if negotiations shall not have resulted in a mutually agreeable amendment to this ordinance within a period of ninety (90) days after the end of the five-year period, then the City Council reserves the right to cancel this franchise by repeal of this ordinance within sixty (60) days following the ninety (90) day period, other provisions of this ordinance concerning termination notwithstanding. If no renegotiation is instituted by the City Council within the time allowed or if the franchise is not canceled within the sixty-day period, this franchise shall continue in full force and effect. Not withstanding the foregoing, City Council reserves the right during the period between the adjournment of the scheduled 2006 budget session of the Wyoming legislature and July 1, 2006, to renegotiate the franchise fee specified in § 6 not to exceed 5%. 
    Section 3. Grantee shall erect and maintain all such facilities in accordance with good engineering practice and so as not to interfere with the use of the streets for travel and other lawful purposes. Whenever Grantee shall excavate or in any manner disturb or interfere with any of the streets, Grantee shall within a reasonable time thereafter put the streets in as good condition as they were before being disturbed, and shall remove all rubbish or other material from the streets. If the removal or relocation of facilities is made for the convenience of the customer, this ordinance shall not preclude Grantee from sharing the expense of removal or relocation to the customer. 
    Section 4. Grantee shall have the right and privilege at its sole cost, risk and expense of trimming all trees which overhang the streets in such a manner and to such an extent as will prevent the branches or limbs or other parts of the trees from touching or interfering with its facilities. No trees shall be trimmed or cut back farther than may be necessary to prevent interference and to allow the proper operation and maintenance of Grantee's facilities. In establishing safe clearances from trees, Grantee shall adhere to appropriate electric utility standards. 
    Section 5. Grantee shall furnish for public and private use during the term hereof and under the conditions of this franchise, electricity and electric energy at the rates and prices and in accordance with tariffs filed and fixed by the Public Service Commission of the State of Wyoming or approved by the Commission and in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Wyoming. 
    Section 6. As consideration for all franchise rights and contractual privileges granted by the City under this franchise, Grantee shall pay to the City an amount equal to five percent (5%) of Grantee's gross operating revenue as defined in this ordinance. Payments shall be made monthly on or before the twentieth day of each month during the term of this ordinance and shall be computed upon the gross operating revenue accrued during the previous month or portion thereof. 
    The term "Gross Revenue" as used herein shall mean and be construed as Grantee's gross operating revenue accruing during the preceding month or fraction thereof from the sale of electricity and electric service within the corporate limits of the City; excluding a) revenue derived from sales of electric service to the City and business done with the U.S. Government or any agency thereof; b) any amounts paid by Grantee to the United States or to the State of Wyoming as excise or business taxes upon the sale or distribution of electric service in the City, and c) (at Grantee's election) the total of all uncollectible revenues from customers within the city during the preceding month or fraction thereof. 
    The amounts payable by Grantee under this ordinance shall not be in addition to any other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes or charges which might otherwise be levied or collected by the City from Grantee in respect to Grantee's electric business or of the exercise of this franchise within the corporate limits of the City. The amount of any license, occupation, franchise, or excise taxes or other charges for corresponding periods shall be reduced by deducting therefrom the franchise fee or charge payable under this ordinance by Grantee; provided that this provision shall not apply to lawful ad valorem taxes levied by the City or other public authority against Grantee's property within the City, nor to the City's charges for plan review or building, construction, or excavation permits. 
    Section 7. Grantee shall protect, defend, and save the City, its officers, employees and agents, harmless against and from any and all damage, claims, and any and all loss, liability, costs or expenses, occasioned by any deliberate or negligent act or omission of Grantee in the construction, maintenance, operation or repair of Grantee's property or any use thereof; and Grantee shall at all times comply with any lawful present or future ordinances, rules or regulations of the City relating to the manner of occupation or use, or to the repair or improvement of the streets. 
    Section 8. Performance of Grantee's obligations hereunder shall be subject to and suspended during prevention thereof or interference therewith, by action of or under governmental authority claiming jurisdiction, or by acts of God, adverse weather, supply, labor or other conditions not wholly controlled by Grantee, but prevention of the obligations shall not relieve Grantee from any monthly payment to the City, and providing that as soon as the act or actions or other conditions causing the suspension have been removed or cease to exist, Grantee shall forthwith resume the suspended operations. 
    Section 9. 
A.  Nothing in this Franchise shall be deemed to waive the lawful requirements of any generally applicable City ordinances existing as of the effective date of this Franchise. 
B.  Each and every term, provision or condition herein is subject to the provisions of state law, federal law, the Code of the City of Laramie, and ordinance and regulations. The Laramie Municipal Code and all subsequent amendments are expressly incorporated in this Franchise. 
C.  This Franchise shall not be interpreted to prevent the City from imposing additional lawful conditions, including additional compensation conditions for use of the streets if the Grantee provides service other than electric service. Any additional compensation conditions shall be uniformly and equally applied to all like service providers. 
    Section 10. This Franchise shall not include or be a substitute for: 
A.  Any permit, agreement or authorization required by the City for Public Way users in connection with operations on or in Public Way or public property including, by way of example and not limitation, street cut or construction permits; or 
B.  Any permits or agreements for occupying any other property of the City or private entities to which access is not specifically granted by this Franchise including, without limitation, permits and agreements for placing non-electric service related equipment on poles, in conduits or in or on other structures. 
C.  Any permit or authorization required for the privilege of transacting and carrying on business within the City that may be required by the ordinances and laws of the city. 
    Section 11. 
A.  Grantee's rights are subject to the police powers of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the safety, health and welfare of the public. Grantee agrees to comply with all laws and ordinances of general applicability enacted, or hereafter enacted, by the City or any other legally constituted governmental unit having lawful jurisdiction over the subject matter. The City shall have the right to adopt, from time to time, ordinances as may be deemed necessary in the exercise of its police power, provided that such ordinances shall be reasonable and not destructive of the rights granted in this ordinance. 
B.  The City reserves the right to exercise its police powers, notwithstanding anything in this ordinance to the contrary and any conflict between the provisions of this ordinance and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the City's police powers. 
    Section 12. By accepting this ordinance, the Grantee: 
A.  Acknowledges and accepts the City's legal right to enact and enforce the ordinance; 
B.  Accepts and agrees to comply with each provision of this ordinance subject to applicable law; and 
C.  Agrees that, if the City enacts and grants the franchise pursuant to then applicable state laws, Wyoming Public Service Commission tariffs and rules, and municipal ordinances, the Grantee shall not raise any claim challenging the validity of City processes and procedures. 
    Section 13. Work in the streets, on other public property, near public property, or on or near private property shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Grantee's system shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of the City, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the streets by or under the City's authority. The Grantee's system shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with new improvements the City may deem proper to make or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets or other public property, and shall not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public during the construction, repair, operation or removal thereof, and shall not obstruct or impede traffic. In the event of interference, the City may require the removal or relocation of Grantee's lines, cables, equipment and other appurtenances at Grantee's expense. 
    Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, not to be less than thirty (30) days, the Grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the streets, or remove from the streets, any property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of structures or improvements by the City. 
    If the Grantee chooses not to relocate or temporarily remove its property, the Grantee may abandon its interfering property. The City shall not require the Grantee to pay for the costs of removal of the abandoned interfering property. 
    If the City has made the City's general funds available to holders of franchises and easements on public streets and ways for such relocation or temporary removal, Grantee shall be entitled to its pro rata share of such general funds. 
    Section 14. The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of such building provided: (A) the expense of temporary raising or lowering of wires is paid by the requestor, including, if required by the Grantee, making payment in advance; and (B) the Grantee is given reasonable written notice which shall not be less than ten (10) business days, to arrange for the temporary wire changes. 
    Section 15. 
    If real property within the City upon which Grantee's overhead facilities are located is included within a local improvement district established pursuant to the Wyoming Underground Conversion of Utilities Law, Wyo. Stat. §§ 37-13-101 to 37-13-137 ("WUCU") or other applicable state laws, Grantee shall comply with the state laws in relocating its facilities. The costs of undergrounding Grantee's facilities shall be paid as provided for under state law. 
    Section 16. By underground facility locating service or other means, Grantee agrees to provide an on-the-ground location for its underground lines whenever requested to do so in aid of construction or engineering work. 
    Section 17. The Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of this ordinance, Commercial General Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury, and property damage and Business Automobile Liability insurance with a minimum single limit of $1,000,000 for bodily injury and property damage with respect to vehicles whether owned, hired or non-owned, assigned to or used in the performance of the work. The Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance designating the City as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the City. 
    Section 18. If the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the Franchise, it shall notify the Grantee in writing of the nature of the noncompliance. 
    The Grantee has thirty days from the notice to respond to the City, contesting the assertion of noncompliance; to cure the default; or if the default cannot be cured within the thirty-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy the default as expediently as possible and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that the default will be cured. 
    If the Grantee fails to respond to the notice described above, pursuant to the procedures set forth above, or if the alleged default is not remedied within thirty days or the date projected pursuant to paragraph above, the City shall schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. The public hearing shall be held at a regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council, which is no less than five business days after the expiration of the thirty-day period. The City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the time and place of such meeting and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard. 
    Subject to applicable federal, state and local law, in the event the City, after such meeting, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of the Franchise, the City may: 
A.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to that remedy, as an alternative to damages; 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief, or 
C.  In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the Franchise, proceed to declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked. 
    If the City seeks to revoke the Franchise after following the procedures set forth above, the City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the Franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance. The Grantee has ninety days from the date of the notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for the objection. If the City has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee within the ninety days, it may seek termination of the Franchise at a public meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least ten days prior to a public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of the meeting and stating its intent to request the termination. 
    At the designated meeting or any continuation or postponement thereof, the City shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the Franchise shall be revoked. 
    The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action, which it deems appropriate to enforce the City's rights under the Franchise in lieu of revocation of the Franchise. 
    Section 19. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response required by this Franchise to be served upon the City or the Grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party upon hand delivery, or, if mailed, two days after having been posted in a correctly addressed envelope sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid.
