608.1.1 To protect the public potable water supply of the City of Lander from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer’s internal distribution system(s) or the customer’s private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system; and
608.1.2 To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the customer’s in-plant potable water system(s) and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and
608.1.3 To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
608.1.4 RESPONSIBILITY– The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (Wyoming DEQ) shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said Wyoming DEQ an approved backflow-prevention assembly is required at the customer’s water service connection; or within the customer’s private water system) for the safety of the water system, the Wyoming DEQ or his/her designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow-prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on his/her premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved assembly(s) at his/her own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested, and maintain said assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met.
608.1.5 It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow
Lander City Code 31
prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the City of Lander Deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and test shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer’s representative, City of Lander Water Department personnel or by a certified tester approved by the DEQ. It shall be the duty of the City of Lander to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the City of Lander in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the customer-user may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such test, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the DEQ.
608.1.6 All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection 608.1.5 be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the DEQ is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the DEQ finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

3-10-1. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS -
Lander City Code 32
(a) STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of Wyoming has in Wyoming State Statute 15-1-103 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Governing Body of the City of Lander, Wyoming, does ordain as follows:
(b) FINDINGS OF FACT
(1) The flood hazard areas of Lander, Wyoming are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2) These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards
areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(c) STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(d) METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES - In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:
Lander City Code 33
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
3-10-2. DEFINITIONS - Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.
(a) ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING - means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active
processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings,
columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the
magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D,
"elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters.

(hh) START OF CONSTRUCTION - (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures
Lander City Code 38
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or
2. Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
(ll) VARIANCE - is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this ordinance when
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits
construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. (For full
requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.).
(mm) VIOLATION - means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such
time as that documentation is provided.
(nn) WATER SURFACE ELEVATION - means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various

require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM,
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
10. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones
A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of
the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a
conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (Conditional Letter of Map Revision).
(c) PERMIT PROCEDURES - Application for a Development Permit shall be presented to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.

Approval or denial of a Development Permit by the Floodplain Administrator shall be based on
all of the provisions of this ordinance and the following relevant factors:
1. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
2. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect
of such damage on the individual owner;
3. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
4. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
5. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
6. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
7. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
8. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
9. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
10. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.
(d) VARIANCE PROCEDURES -
Lander City Code 42
1. The appeal Board as established by the community shall hear and render judgement on
requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
2. The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
3. Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such
decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
4. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal
and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
5. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places,
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
6. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected
on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in
Section C(2) of this Article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
7. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Appeal
Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance (Article 1, Section C).
8. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
9. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
10. Prerequisites for granting variances:
a) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
b) Variances shall only be issued upon:
1) showing a good and sufficient cause;
2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
Lander City Code 43
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
3) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c) Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that
the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the
base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
11. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that:
a) the criteria outlined in Article 4, Section D(1)-(9) are met, and
b) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
3-10-5 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION -
(a) GENERAL STANDARDS - In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
1. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
2. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and
practices that minimize flood damage;
3. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage;
4. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities
that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
5. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the system;
Lander City Code 44
6. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood
waters; and,
7. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding.
(b) SPECIFIC STANDARDS - In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Article 3, Section B, (ii) Article 4, Section B(8), or (iii) Article 5, Section C(3), the following provisions are required:
1. Residential Construction - new construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land
surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of
this subsection as proposed in Article 4, Section C(1)a., is satisfied.
2. Nonresidential Construction - new construction and substantial improvements of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of
such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
3. Enclosures - new construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be

Lander City Code 45
c) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
4. Manufactured Homes –
a) Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's
FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize
flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be
elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
b) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within
Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement.
c) Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on
the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this
section be elevated so that either:
1) the lowest floor of the manufactured home elevate to or above the base flood
elevation, or
2) the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
a) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
b) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
Lander City Code 46
c) meet the permit requirements of Article 4, Section C(1), and the elevation and
anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(c) STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS -
1. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with Article 1, Sections B, C, and D of this ordinance.
2. All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Development Permit requirements
of Article 3, Section C; Article 4, Section C; and the provisions of Article 5 of this
ordinance.
3. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed
development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions
which is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided
pursuant to Article 3, Section B or Article 4, Section B (8) of this ordinance.
4. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(d) FLOODWAYS - Floodways - located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. If Article 5, Section E (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
Article 5.
3. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted
Lander City Code 47
regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through
FEMA.
(e) BELOW-GRADE RESEIDENTIAL CRAWLSPACE CONSTRUCTION - New construction and substantial improvement of any below-grade crawlspace shall:
1. Have the interior grade elevation that is below base flood elevation no lower than two feet
2. Have the height of the below-grade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall, not exceeding four feet at any point;
3. Have an adequate drainage system that allows floodwaters to drain from the interior area of the crawlspace following a flood;
4. Be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure and be capable of resisting the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads;
5. Be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
6. Be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
7. Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding
8. Be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
a. A minimum of two opening having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade
c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(f) STANDARDS FOR ZONES WITHOUT BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND/OR FLOODWAY (A ZONES) - These standards apply in Special Flood Hazard Areas where streams exist but no base flood elevation data have been provided (A Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated.
Lander City Code 48
1. When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been identified by FEMA in a Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood insurance Rate Maps, then the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this ordinance. If data is not available from any source, only then the following provisions apply.
2. In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or crawlspace) elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with the constructions standards in Section A and B (3) of this article.
(g) PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $ 750.00 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Lander from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(h) CERTIFICATION
It is hereby found and declared by the City of Lander that severe flooding has occurred in the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly occur within the future; that flooding is likely to result in infliction of serious personal injury or death, and is likely to result in substantial injury or destruction of property within its jurisdiction; in order to effectively comply with minimum standards for coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program; and in order to effectively remedy the situation described herein, it is necessary that this ordinance become effective immediately.
Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this ordinance, being necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect

4-12-10 Regulating and Restricting the Height of Structures and Objects in the Vicinity of Hunt Field Airport – Intent. This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred upon the City by Section 10-5-301, Wyoming Statutes, 1977, as amended. It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of Hunt Field Airport, a Municipal airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also if the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Hunt Field Airport and the public investment therein. The City of Lander declares that:
(a) that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by Hunt Field Airport;
(b) that it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and
(c) that the prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation;
(d) that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interest in land;
4-12-11. Definitions – As used in this ordinance, unless the context otherwise requires:

Airport Zones - In order to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones as they apply to Hunt Field Airport. Such zones are shown within the Lander Municipal Airport Layout Plan consisting of eight (8) sheets, prepared by James Gores and Associates, which is on file at the Lander City Hall. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
(a) Utility runway visual approach zone – The inner edge of this
36
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

Its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(c) Transitional zones – These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at 90- degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
(d) Horizontal zone – The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
(e) Conical zone – The conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional zones.

In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach zones, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway
37
approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, height limits sloping upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically shall be maintained beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as precision instrument runway approach surface, and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
(d) Horizontal zone – One hundred and fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or a height of 5,736 feet above mean sea level.

(f) Excepted height limitations – Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height which is not in conflict with any other provision of this ordinance.
Where an area is covered by more than one (1) height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.
4-12-14. Use Limitations – Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this ordinance in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
4-12-15. Nonconforming Uses –

38
shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone.
(ii) Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall granted.
(b) Exiting uses – No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
(c) Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed – Whenever the City Public Works Director determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
(d) Variances – Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance.
(e) Hazard marking and lighting – Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the city, at its own expense, to install,
operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.

such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this ordinance. All other City of Lander ordinances or parts of said ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
9-1-1.2: City of Lander Immunity. - This chapter shall not be construed as imposing upon the City of Lander or any employee of the City of Lander any liability or responsibility for any damages to any person injured or property damaged by the performance of any excavation work for which an excavation permit is issued or for an emergency excavation. Nor shall the City of Lander or any official or employee thereof be deemed to have assumed any such liability or responsibility by reason of inspection authority under this chapter, the issuance of any permit or the approval of any excavation work.
9-1-2: Determining the Total Annual Cost of Operation and Maintenance. - The City of Lander, by its City Treasurer shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance during the service life of the treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment, replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory test, and a reasonable contingency fund.

Each user shall pay for the services of the wastewater system provided by the City of Lander based on their use of the water treatment works as determined by water meter(s) for irrigation systems acceptable to the City of Lander. The user charge rates established by resolution apply to all users of the City of Lander’s water treatment works, regardless of the user’s location.

Lander City Code Page 4
occupancy the property owner will submit a transfer form signed by both the tenant and the landlord. (Section 9-2-2 and 9-2-2.1 amended Ordinance 1185 effective 2/2/14)
9-2-3: Industrial and Commercial Users For industrial and commercial users, users charges shall be based on water used during the current month.

9-2-4: Fiscal Obligations and Review of Utility Rates. The City of Lander shall establish, by resolution, rates for water and wastewater use. The City of Lander will utilize a financial plan to evaluate the present and future fiscal obligations of its water and wastewater enterprise fund.

The City Treasurer shall hold a work session and public hearing with the City Council to review the fiscal condition of the fund.
9-2-5: Discharge of Pollutants Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the City of Lander’s treatment works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance, or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each user shall be as determined by the responsible plant operating personnel and approved by the City Council.

c. Variances
(1) When it can be shown that in the case of a particular subdivision, strict compliance with the provisions of these regulations would cause undue hardship, the City Council may authorize a variance to these requirements. The granting of any variance shall be based upon findings by the Council that:
(a) The subdivider is proceeding in good faith.
(b) There are unusual topographical or other special circumstances associated with the property which are not the result of any action of the subdivider and which prohibit the use of the property in a manner similar to the use of adjacent or nearby properties.
(c) The variance is necessary for reasonable development of the property in question and will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship.
(d) The variance will not nullify the intent or purpose of these regulations.
(e) Granting the variance will not be detrimental to the general public health, safety and welfare.
(2) Any variance granted shall constitute the minimum adjustment necessary to alleviate the hardship.
(3) A request for a variance may be submitted only after the Planning Commission has formally reviewed the Preliminary Plat and has either (1)
13
recommended disapproval because the Plat does not conform to these regulations, or (2) conditionally approved the Plat specifying those amendments which must appear on the Final Plat in order for it to be approved. The subdivider may then seek relief from the specific provisions of these regulations with which he cannot comply.
(4) All requests for variances shall be submitted in writing to the City Council and shall be referred to the Planning Commission for comments and recommendations prior to any action taken by the City Council. In granting a variance, the Council may impose such conditions as will insure substantial compliance with the objectives and standards of these regulations. The findings and action on each variance and any conditions imposed shall be recorded in the minutes of the Council and a copy thereof provided to the Department of Planning.
(5) If the subdivision variance is granted by the City Council, the subdivider may incorporate the provisions of the variance into the Final Plat to be submitted to the Planning Commission and to the Council for approval. In its review of the Final Plat, the Planning Commission shall be bound by the decision of the Council regarding the variance and shall review and approve the Final Plat with the variance if the Plat in all other respects conforms to the Preliminary Plat and any other conditions imposed by the Planning Commission.
d. Vacations

In cases where lots have been sold, the written request shall be by all of the owners of lots within the plat. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation on the vacation to the City Council and the Council shall approve or disapprove the vacation. The recording of an instrument vacating the plat shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the original plat and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys, common and public grounds laid out or described in such a plat.
(2) Streets and alleys platted and laid out under the provisions of these regulations or laid out under any prior law of the State of Wyoming regulating private plats may be altered or vacated in the manner provided by law for the alteration or discontinuance of highways.
(3) Any part of a plat may be vacated under the provisions, and subject to the conditions of Section 5 d (1) of these regulations, provided such vacating does not abridge or destroy any of the rights and privileges of other proprietors in said plat and provided, further, that nothing contained in this section shall authorize the closing or obstruction of any public highways
14
laid out according to law. The request for vacation shall be made by all of the owners of lots within that portion of the overall plat sought to be vacated.
(4) When any part of a plat shall be vacated as afore said, streets, alleys and other public grounds shall be assigned to all lots or parcels adjacent to the public area being vacated in equal proportions.
(5) The County Clerk shall write in plain, legible letters across that part of said plat so vacated, the word "vacated" and also make a reference on the same to the volume and page in which the said instrument of vacation is recorded.
(6) Land covered by a vacated plat may be replatted as described by these regulations. Any later replatting of an area already platted and not vacated shall be construed to be a request for the vacation of the original plat or portion thereof. Any such plat, once approved and recorded, shall act to vacate the original plat which it replaces.
e. Administrative Liability.
The City shall hold harmless the Department of Planning, other city agencies and officials and their official agents and representatives, when acting in good faith and without malice, from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to any person or property as a result of any act required by these regulations, or for the omission of any act on the part of the Department, agency or official or their authorized agents in the discharge of their duties hereunder.

If required by the City Engineer, the subdivider shall also submit with the Final Plat a signed and acknowledged instrument in recordable form dedicating to the
27
City those easements shown on the plat which may be needed in advance of the plat being recorded. The subdivider shall also agree to cooperate with the City Engineer in the necessary inspections of the construction of subdivision improvements. When the completed improvements are inspected and approved by the City Engineer and, if proposed for City maintenance, accepted by the City, the plat shall be recorded and the sale of lots may proceed according to the approved and recorded plat. The City Council may repeal the approval of the plat should the subdivider fail to meet the terms of the contract.
(16) Building permits shall not be issued until all public improvements have been installed, approved by the City Engineer and accepted by the City Council.

Certificates of occupancy shall not be issued until all public improvements have been installed, approved by the City Engineer and accepted by the City Council.
d. Minor Plats.
For subdivisions consisting of five lots or less, where street dedications are not required, and/or on the determination of the Department of Planning, the subdivider may proceed directly to the preparation of the Final Plat. The Department shall designate those information requirements from the Preliminary and Final Plat processes that will be necessary for the Planning Commission to adequately evaluate the subdivision.
e. Corrected Plats and Resubdivisions
(1) If, after the approval and recording of a Final Plat, errors are found in the language or numbers on the recorded Plat, the subdivider shall file a properly signed, corrected or revised original mylar or linen with the Department. The Plat shall be noted CORRECTED PLAT under the name of the subdivision. Notations shall be made on the face of the Plat listing all corrections made and the book and page numbers where the original plat was recorded. The Department shall review the Plat for correction, secure the signatures of the proper public officials on the corrected plat and present the plat to the City Council for the reaffirmation of their approval and to the County Clerk for recording. The recording of the corrected plat shall void the incorrect original plat and the County Clerk shall note VOID across the face of the incorrect plat.
(2) If, after the approval and recording of a Final Plat, a subdivider wishes to modify the location of lot lines on a part or all of the recorded plat, and if there is no change in the location or size of the dedicated streets, the
28
subdivider shall submit a new Final Plat drawing the lotting arrangement revised. The Planning Director shall determine which of the required supporting documents shall be resubmitted with the revised Final Plat. The plat shall be marked the RESUBDIVISION OF under the name of the subdivision and shall be processed as a Final Plat.
(3) If, after the approval and recording of a Final Plat, a subdivider wishes to substantially change the street and lotting arrangement of a part or all of the platted area, the resulting subdivision shall be treated as a new submittal with both a Preliminary Plat and a Final Plat required. Based on the currency of the information submitted with the original plat, the Planning Director shall determine which of the required supporting documents must be resubmitted. The subdivision shall be identified as the RESUBDIVISION OF .
f. Planned Unit Development (PUD)
1. Intent - This chapter for planned unit developments (PUD) is intended to provide for the growing demand for housing of all types and designs and for necessary supportive commercial facilities conveniently located to such housing, to create functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that projects will be assets to the community. It is the purpose of this chapter:
(a) To promote and permit flexibility that will encourage innovative and Imaginative approaches in land development and renewal which will result in a more efficient, aesthetic. desirable and economic use of land while maintaining density and intensity of use consistent with the applicable adopted plans, regulations and policies of the city;
(b) To promote development within the city that can be conveniently, efficiently and economically served by existing municipal utilities and services or by their logical extension;
(c) To promote design flexibility including placement of buildings, use of open space, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems to and through the site and off-street parking areas in a manner that will best utilize potential on-site characteristics such as, topography, geology, geography, size and proximity;
(d) To provide for the preservation of historic or natural features where they are shown to be in the public interest, including but not limited to such features as: drainage ways, flood plains, existing topography or rock outcroppings, unique areas of vegetation, historic landmarks or structures;
(e) To provide for compatibility with the area surrounding the project site;
(f) To provide for usable and suitably located open space such as, but not limited to, bicycle paths, playground areas, courtyards, tennis courts, swimming pools, planned gardens, outdoor seating areas, outdoor picnic areas, and similar open space;
(g) To minimize adverse environmental impacts of development;
(h) To improve the design, quality and character of new development.
29
(2) General - A planned unit development shall be consistent with the statement of purpose for planned unit development and the following criteria:
Density -
(a) The maximum gross density of the PUD is based on the zone in which it is located. Actual gross density shall be computed by dividing the total acreage of the planned unit development by the number of dwelling units. The density for portions of the PUD may exceed the maximum gross density for the underlying zone as long as the maximum gross density for the entire PUD does not exceed the maximum gross density allowed in that zone. The net density of a particular phase of the PUD shall be computed by dividing the acreage of the phase by the number of dwelling units. The total acreage shall be that area contained in the planned development application and include all proposed streets, common area, public parks and dwelling sites and similar areas within the proposed development. When such computation ends with more than 0.5 of a dwelling unit, the maximum density will be increased to the next whole number;
(b) The maximum density shall be based on the applicable zoning designation as follows:
Zone
Maximum Density
R-1
4 residential units per gross acre.
R-2
10 residential units per gross acre.
R-3
18 residential units per gross acre.
R-5
44 residential units per gross acre.
For PUDs in the General Commercial District, the maximum density allowed would be the same as the R-3 zone: eighteen residential units per acre;
(c) Density bonuses may be awarded as set forth in Section12:
i. Ownership. Each application shall be signed by the owners of all the property to be included in the planned unit development. At the time of filing any final development plan under this chapter, the owner shall file a recordable agreement between the owner and the city in the office of the county clerk providing for a mandatory homeowners association when ownership of the property is divided. When used in this chapter, the term "developer" means the same as "owner."
ii. Common Areas. Before final plan approval, the developers shall specify the manner of holding title to common areas or facilities of joint use. Such areas and facilities shall be
30
retained in title by the developers of the planned unit development or deeded to an organization composed of all owners in the development. The method used by the developers is subject to approval by the city attorney.
Standards. Planned unit developments shall meet the use and development standards in Sections 13(a) through 13(m)(iii) of this chapter and all use and development standards and requirements in this code. Where the standards and requirements of this chapter conflict with the requirements of other earlier enacted sections of this code, the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
Permitted Uses. Except as otherwise permitted or restricted, all uses permitted in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-5 districts are permitted in a PUD provided that any commercial uses proposed for the PUD must meet the satisfaction of the department of planning and that such uses, if any, shall not change, injure, or destroy, temporarily or permanently, the predominantly residential character of the PUD.

The city council shall advise the developer in writing of the refusal, setting forth the reasons why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest.
(g) A plan or any part thereof which has been given final approval by the city council, shall be so certified upon the face of the final development plan by the mayor and filed in the office of the county clerk. If the developer chooses to abandon a plan or portion thereof after it has been given final approval, he or she shall so notify the city council in writing.

(ii) The size of the buffer needed in terms of width and height to achieve the purpose.
(iii) The location of the buffer.
SECTION 7: DEDICATION OF PUBLIC LANDS AND WATER RIGHTS-
(a) In any subdivision or resubdivision platted after the effective date of these regulations, lands shall be dedicated, or fees in lieu thereof shall be paid, to the City of Lander in order that adequate open spaces and sites for public use may be properly located and preserved as the City develops, and in order that the cost of providing additional public sites and facilities may be most equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional need created by individual subdivision development.
(b) Consideration shall be given to the adequate provision and location of such public sites and facilities in the design of the subdivision.
(c) In residentially zoned areas, the amount of land to be dedicated shall be computed by calculating, from the plat, the net developable land area (exclusive of proposed or existing streets and public lands) in each residential zone district and then determining the maximum number of dwelling units which could be allowed in the subdivision. The number of allowable dwelling units shall be multiplied by 2.74 persons per dwelling unit to determine the potential population of the area. One (1) acre of land shall be dedicated for each two hundred (200) persons as determined in this manner.
(d) Any land dedicated to meet the requirements of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for the public use for which it is intended and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. When the area designated by the owner is not suitable, or if the site is not consistent with the City plan, the Planning Commission may require that an alternate parcel be dedicated.
(e) In the event that the application of these standards would result in sites too small to
42
be usable, or if the City Council determines that suitable public sites cannot properly be located in the area covered by the plat, then a payment of a fee-in-lieu of the land dedication shall be required for park development.
(f) The amount of the fee shall be $250 per lot in a subdivision. The land dedication fee is to be set aside for future park land acquisitions. This fee shall be paid prior to the filing of the final plat of the subdivision. (Section 7(f) amended by Resolution 576, effective 8/27/96)
(g) If the value of such land cannot be determined satisfactorily by the City and the subdivider, an appraisal board consisting of one appraiser selected by the City at its own expense, one selected by the property owner at his own expense and a third selected by the other two appraisers at City expense, shall determine the value.
(h) Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be credited against the requirements for a land dedication provided that the City Council finds that:
(1) The public interest is adequately served by this arrangement.
(2) The land is reasonably suitable for the park, recreation or open space use proposed.
(3) Adequate written assurances are submitted that the open space will be developed in a timely fashion for the open space, park, or recreational activity for which the land is intended.
(4) The long-term preservation of the open space and its operation and maintenance are provided for in a written agreement, a copy of which shall be recorded with the plat.
(5) A public park, recreation or open space function other than that proposed by the subdivider is not needed in the area.
i. Prior to acceptance of the Final Plat, by the City Council, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate, transfer and assign to the City of Lander sufficient water to meet all of the anticipated water needs of the subdivision upon full development as determined by the Engineering Supervisor in accordance with guidelines as approved by the City Council. When it is alleged that the above requirement for conveyance of water will create an unnecessary hardship on the subdivider, application may be made to the City Council for a variance in such requirement. In lieu of meeting such requirement and after the City Council does not grant relief therefrom, either in whole or in part, the subdivider shall pay reasonable costs to the City for the acquisition of such water which the subdivider is unable to provide. The cost of the acquisition of such water shall be determined by the Engineering Supervisor in accordance with guidelines as approved by the City Council. Such fund shall be kept in a separate fund and be used by the City only for the purpose of purchasing water.

appurtenances, complete. This item shall consist of all necessary clearing, grubbing and site
preparation; removal of all material of whatever description that may be encountered; removal
and disposal of debris; all necessary bracing, shoring and protection; pumping and dewatering as
necessary; all backfill, preparation of subgrades; and final grading, dressing, surface restoration
and cleanup of the site.
SECTION 201.07 - STRIPPING
When crossing existing or prospective cultivated areas, gravel streets or other developed
surfaces, the Contractor shall strip the cover material to full depth at the existing surfacing. This
surfacing shall be stockpiled and placed back over the trench after backfilling to the extent that it
is acceptable and usable for that purpose. Topsoil shall be moved to full depth of the topsoil, or
to a maximum depth of 12 inches, whichever is less.
All established lawn areas cut by the trench or damaged during the course of the work shall be
restored to condition comparable to its surrounding area and to the complete satisfaction of the
engineer.
SECTION 201.08 - TRENCH EXCAVATION
A. General - All excavation, trenching and shoring and the up line, shall be performed in a
manner that meets with the OSHA Department of Labor, Safety and Health Regulations
for Construction.
When necessary to minimize sliding or caving of the trench, it will be permissible to
slope the banks from the surface to an elevation 12 inches above the top of the bells,
flanges or collars, trench banks below said elevation shall be maintained in a vertical
plane until the pipe has been bedded and backfilled to an elevation of 12 inches above the
pipe barrel.
Crossings under sidewalks or curbs may be made by tunneling only if approved by 
Sect 201 page 3 of 12
Engineer. If the contractor elects to remove a portion of the sidewalk or curb, he must
use a concrete saw for making neat joints corresponding to existing joints, compact the
backfill as specified and pour a new concrete sidewalk or curb section.
During excavation, materials suitable for backfilling shall be piled in an orderly manner a
sufficient distance from the banks of the trench to avoid overloading and to prevent slides
or cave-ins. Excavated material shall be piled on one side of the trench only, to permit
ready access to existing fire alarm boxes, fire hydrants, valves, manholes and other
appurtenances. Surface drainage of adjoining areas shall be unobstructed.
All excavated materials not required or suitable for backfill shall be removed from the
site as directed by the Engineer.
Grading shall be done as may be necessary to prevent surface water from flowing into
excavations and any other water accumulating therein shall be promptly removed. Under
no circumstances shall water be permitted to rise in unbackfilled trenches until after the
pipe has been placed, tested and covered with backfill. Any pipe having its alignment or
grade changed as a result of a flooded trench shall be re-laid at no additional cost to the
owner.
The bottom of the trenches shall be accurately graded to the line and grade shown on the
drawings. Bedding material shall provide uniform bearing and support for each section
of the pipe at every point along its entire length. Bell holes and depressions for joints
shall be dug after the trench bedding has been graded, and shall be only of such length,
depth and width as required for properly making the particular type joint. Unauthorized
overdepths shall be backfilled with bedding material at the Contractor's expense.
There will be no differentiation between common and rock trench excavation, except
when listed as separate items on the bid proposal or bid form. Excavation shall include
the removal and subsequent handling of all earth, gravel, rock or other material
encountered regardless of the type, character, composition or condition of the material.
B. Trench Dimensions - Trench dimensions shall be as specified below:
(1) Width - The width of the trench shall be such to provide adequate working room
for men to install and join the pipe in the specified manner. The width of the
trench shall be adequate in width to allow proper compactive effort along both
sides of the pipe.
(2) Depth of Trench - Trench depth shall be as required for the invert grade or pipe
bury shown on the plans. Care shall be taken not to excavate below the required
depth.
When soft or unstable material or rock is encountered at the subgrade which will 
Sect 201 page 4 of 12
not uniformly support the pipe, such material shall be excavated to an additional
depth as directed by the Engineer and backfilled with Type 2 Bedding Material.
C. Blasting - Blasting for excavation will be permitted only after securing the approval of
the engineer and the hours of blasting will be fixed by the engineer. The contractor shall
use the utmost care to protect life and property. All explosives shall be safely and
securely stored in compliance with local laws and ordinances and all such storage places
shall be clearly marked "Dangerous Explosives". No explosives shall be left unprotected
where they could endanger persons or property.
When blasting rock in trenches, the contractor shall cover the area to be shot with earth
backfill or approved blasting mats that will prevent the scattering of rock fragments
outside the excavation. Prior to blasting, the contractor shall station men and provide
signals of danger in suitable places to warn people and stop vehicles. The contractor will
be responsible for all damage to property and injury to person resulting from blasting or
accidental explosions that may occur in connection with is use of explosives.
The contractor shall furnish the following information to the owner and engineer prior to
commencing blasting operations: Name of his powder man, powder man's experience,
type of shot, type of explosives and detonator being used, proof of insurance covering
liability for such operation, traffic control plans and planned procedures for protection of
the public.
The contractor's blasting procedures shall conform to federal, state and local ordinances.
The contractor shall acquire al required permits prior to the start of blasting.
D. Equipment - The use of trench digging machinery will be permitted except in places
where its operation will cause damage to existing structures or features; in which case
hand methods shall be employed.
Any equipment operating on tracks, which is to be used on pavement, shall be equipped
with suitable pads to prevent damage to the pavement. Backhoes shall be equipped with
street pads on the outrigger arms. All pavement damage during construction by the
contractor's equipment shall be restored to its original condition by the contractor. No
compensation will be allowed for pavement replacement other than as specified
elsewhere.
E. Dewatering - Where ground water is encountered in excavation, it shall be removed to
avoid interfering with pipe laying and other construction operations. The cost of
dewatering operation will not be paid for as a separate item, but shall be merged with and
considered a part of the excavation cost.
F. Shoring, Sheeting and Bracing - The contractor shall do all shoring, bracing, tight
sheeting required to prevent caving and to protect his workmen, in accordance with 
Sect 201 page 5 of 12
Occupational Safety and Health Regulation Requirements and to protect adjacent
property and structures. No extra payment shall be made for these items.

G. Excavation for Appurtenances - Excavation for manholes, hydrants, structures and other
appurtenances shall be sufficient to leave clearance adequate for proper compactive effort
on all sides. The depth, provisions for removing water and other applicable portions of
these specifications shall apply to excavation for appurtenances.
SECTION 201.09 - TRENCH BACKFILL
A. Excavation - All trenches shall be backfilled immediately after grade, alignment and
jointing of the pipe has been inspected and approved by the engineer. Leakage tests,
pressure tests or tests for alignment and grade shall be performed after backfill. If any
test fails, the contractor shall be responsible for work required to correct the defects at no
additional cost to the owner.
B. Pipe Bedding Material - Type I bedding material around and to twelve (12) inches over
the pipe shall consist of select earth, sand or fine gravel, free from clods, lumps of frozen
material or stones larger than one and a half (1 ½) inches in their maximum dimension.
Where wet or otherwise unstable conditions exist, the material in this zone shall be free
draining, non-plastic material. Where suitable material is available in the material
excavated from the trench, the contractor may procure the select material by screening,
sifting or manually sorting the material removed from the trench. The rock shall be
removed from the project and disposed of by the contractor at his expense.
Type 2 pipe bedding shall be required where specified for flexible pipe and for over
excavated foundations in wet and unstable trenches. Where required for pipe bedding,
the material shall be placed from four (4) inches below to a point twelve (12) inches
above the top of the pipe. The bedding material shall consist of well-graded sand or sand
gravel mixtures having a maximum size of 1 ½ inches. Poorly graded gravel with a
maximum size of 3/4 inches may be used at the direction of the engineer.
Bedding material under and around the pipe to twelve (12) inches above the top of the
pipe shall be distributed by hand in maximum layers of six (6) inches and thoroughly
compacted by tamping. Special care shall be taken to assure complete compaction under
the haunches of the pipe.
Backfill material shall be placed in the trench for its full width on each side
simultaneously. Compaction of pipe bedding shall be in accordance with the pipe
manufacturer's recommendations.
Water settling of this portion of the trench will not be allowed and the addition of water
shall be limited to that required for optimum moisture for maximum compaction of the 
Sect 201 page 6 of 12
material.
1. General - After the select pipe or utility cable bedding material has been placed
and compacted as specified above, the remainder of the trench backfilling shall be
done. All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, organic and
frozen material, boulders or other materials that are unsuitable. From one (1) foot
above the top of pipe to six inches (6") below the ground surface or to the
subgrade elevation for streets or paved surfaces, material containing stones up to
eight inches (8") in the greatest dimension may be used.
Trench backfill from the top of the pipe or utility cable bedding material to
ground surface or to the subgrade of street surfacing is separated into three
classifications. Type A trench backfill refers to compacted backfill in paved
streets to four feet (4') behind the curb and other paved areas, while type B
backfill is designated for alleys and unimproved streets. Type C backfill is
designated for fields, borrow pits and other unsurfaced areas where special
compaction of the trench backfill is not required. Locations of the types of
backfill required shall be as shown on the plans or in the special provisions.
2. Type A Trench Backfill - Materials used for backfill shall be carefully deposited
in layers suitable to the equipment used for compaction, wetted to optimum
moisture content and then compacted to not less than 90% of maximum density to
within six inches (6") of the finished subgrade and 95% of maximum density for
the top six inches (6") of backfill, subgrade, when determined in accordance with
the requirements of AASHTO T-99 standard method of test for moisture density
relations of soils.
Compaction by jetting and vibrating or wheelrolling will only be permitted by
approval of the engineer. Whenever the trenches have not been properly
compacted, or if settlement occurs, they shall be reopened to the depth required
for proper compaction and refilled and recompacted. See section five (5) on
compaction by jetting and vibrating or wheelrolling.
The contractor shall provide excavation equipment to dig compaction test holes
through each layer of backfill where the layers exceed one foot (1') in depth as
directed by the engineer. Should the test fail, the deficiencies shall be corrected
by the contractor at his expense.
3. Type B Trench Backfill - Materials used for backfill shall be deposited in layers
suitable to the equipment used for compaction and compacted to 85% of
maximum density, when determined in accordance with the requirements of
ASSHTO T-99 or equal to the density of the surrounding material, whichever is
greater.
For graveled streets and alleys the backfill shall be completed by blading the 
Sect 201 page 7 of 12
stripped gravel back over the trench.
4. Type C Trench Backfill - Materials used for Type C Trench Backfill shall not
require special compaction. However, the material shall be placed in layers to
achieve a density equal to the density of the surrounding material.
The contractor may be required to mound excess earth over the top of the trench
so that a depression will not be formed after the trench settles. In cultivated areas,
the stripped topsoil shall be placed uniformly over the backfilled trench. The
topsoil shall not be compacted but shall be graded to provide a smooth surface
conforming to the adjoining ground surfaces.
5. Compaction by Jetting and Vibrating or Wheel Rolling - Consolidation of backfill
by jetting and vibrating will only be allowed when the backfill material has a
plastic index of 6 or less (cohesionless soils) and when consolidation is obtained
in the following manner:
Backfill shall be loosely placed over the consolidated bedding to within six inches
of finish grade and allowed to set for a period of five days, providing sufficient
time for the concrete encasement and mortars to become hard enough to
withstand the backfill consolidation.
The loose backfill shall then be consolidated by water jetting and vibration.
Water, at a minimum pressure of 40 PSI, shall be injected into the backfill
through a rigid pipe nozzle to within one foot of the top of the pipe. If water is
not available from a distribution system, the Contractor shall equip a supply tank,
or other water source, with a suitable pressure pump. Vibrators shall be of
immersion type of adequate power to consolidate the mass and of sufficient
length to reach within one foot of the top of the pipe. A vibrating ram mounted
on a backhoe may also be used for compaction.
Care shall be taken to use only sufficient water at each jetting point to insure
permeation of the backfill and proper consolidation and not result in surface
saturation. The vibrator shall not be removed from the mass until after the jet is
removed. The jetting pipe nozzle and the vibrator shall be inserted in the backfill
at sufficiently close intervals along the trench to insure that uniform consolidation
will result.
After the jetted and vibrated backfill has settled and the surface is dry enough to
be stable, the balance of the trench shall be filled in eight inch loose lifts, each lift
being thoroughly compacted at the proper moisture content, to the relative
compaction specified in paragraphs two or three.
If wheel rolling rather than vibrating is used for compaction, then as soon as the
surface is dry enough to be stable (from one to one and a half days), thoroughly 
Sect 201 page 8 of 12
wheelroll the backfill. The balance of the trench shall be filled in eight inch loose
lifts, each lift being thoroughly compacted, at the proper moisture content, to the
relative compaction specified in paragraphs two or three.
6. Compacted Control Tests - Test for laboratory and field densities shall be
performed in accordance with Section 601.10, COMPACTION CONTROL
TESTS.
D. Backfilling for Appurtenances - Backfill around appurtenances shall be deposited in such
a manner as not to disturb the appurtenance from its proper alignment and compacted to
the finished grade. Backfill material, compaction and backfill procedures shall conform
to the requirements of the related Type A or Type B backfill as specified for trenches.
E. Backfill Above Original Ground For Minimum Cover Requirements - Where shown on
the plans, the contractor shall provide embankment over the pipe above the original
ground surface to a height which will satisfy the minimum depth of cover requirements.
Such embankment shall be constructed to the cross section shown on the plans. No
additional compensation will be paid for embankment unless shown as a specific item on
the proposal.
SECTION 201.10 - CONTRACTOR'S SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES
The contractor shall be responsible for enforcing safety and maintaining safe working conditions
in all trenching, shoring and blasting operations to conform to Wyoming Occupational Health
and Safety Rules and Regulations for Construction.
The contractor shall employ qualified, properly trained personnel to design shoring, perform
safety inspections of the trenches and supervise the handling of explosives and other operations
involving safety procedures, as prescribed by Wyoming Occupational Health and Safety
Commission.

public utilities with underground facilities located in the area of proposed excavation;
and providing for exceptions. See attached copy of Title 37, Public Utilities.
Existing utilities which will intersect with the new pipelines or structures will be
relocated by the owner or by the contractor when the relocation is authorized in writing.
In the event the contractor is authorized to relocate the utilities, payment will be made in
accordance with the General Conditions.
Existing water or sewer services from the mains to private property which interfere with
trenching operations may be cut and replaced at the contractor's option and expense. The
use of such services shall in no case be interrupted for more than four (4) hours, unless
specifically permitted in writing by the user.
Existing water mains and water services shall be protected at all times during
construction operations.
B. Privately Owned Utilities - Gas mains, underground electrical and telephone cables,
telephone poles, light poles, etc., required to be moved to make way for new construction
will be moved by others.
C. Exploratory Excavation - Location of buried utilities that might interfere with alignment
or grade shall be verified by exploratory excavation prior to construction. If any existing
utility interferes with the work in either alignment or grade and has to be moved, such
work shall be done by the contractor and adjustment in payment will be made at a price
agreed upon before the work is started.
D. Maintenance of Flows - Adequate provisions shall be made for maintaining the flow of

repair them to the satisfaction of the owner of the damaged structure and at no cost to the
owner.
F. Overhead Utilities - The contractor shall use extreme caution to avoid a conflict, contact
or damage to overhead utilities, such as power lines, street lights, telephone lines,
television lines, poles or other appurtenances during the course of construction of this
project. 
Sect 201 page 10 of 12
G. Pavement Removal - Where trench excavation or structure excavation requires the
removal of curb and gutter, concrete sidewalks or asphaltic or concrete pavement, the
pavement or concrete shall be cut in a straight line parallel to the edge of the excavation
by use of a spadebitted air hammer, concrete saw or similar approved equipment to
obtain a straight, square clean break. Pavement cuts shall be two (2) feet wider than the
actual trench opening and centered over such trench.
H. Survey Markers and Monuments - The contractor shall use every care and precaution to
protect and not disturb any survey marker or monuments, such as those that might be
located at lot or block corners, property line, intersection of street monuments or addition
line demarcation. Such protection shall include marking with flagged high lath and close

engineer. Any survey marker or monument that is disturbed or destroyed by the
contractor without approval during the construction of this project shall be replaced at no
cost to the owner by a licensed land surveyor.
SECTION 201.13 - SURFACE RESTORATION
A. Temporary Resurfacing - During construction the trench backfill shall be topped out with
not less than nine inches (9") of WHD grading W crushed base course and maintained
free of chuck holes, ruts and loose rock, by patrolling until asphalt surfacing is in place.
During cold weather the contractor shall install temporary bituminous resurfacing two
inches (2") thick at locations determined by the engineer whenever excavation is made
through pavement, sidewalk or driveways. In sidewalk areas the temporary bituminous
resurfacing shall be at least one inch (1") thick; in all other areas it shall be at least two
inches (2") thick. At major intersections and other critical locations, a greater thickness
may be ordered. Temporary resurfacing shall be placed as soon as the condition of the
backfill is suitable to receive it and shall remain in place until the condition of the
backfill is suitable for permanent resurfacing.
The bituminous mixture used for temporary trench resurfacing may be furnished from
stockpiles or directly from the plant mixer and may be laid cold, at the option of the
contractor. The resurfacing shall be placed, rolled, maintained and removed and
disposed of by the contractor.
B. Permanent Resurfacing - Unless otherwise specified on the plans or in the special
provisions, all surface improvements damaged or removed as a result of the contractor's
operations shall be reconstructed by the contractor to the same dimensions, except for
pavement thickness and with the same type materials used in the original work. Trench
resurfacing shall be the depth of adjacent asphalt or three inches (3"), whichever is
greater, placed in two layers. When hot mix pavement material is not available, cold mix
pavement material may be used, but shall have a minimum depth of four inches (4"),
placed in two equal layers. See Standard Drawing No. 201.02. 
Sect 201 page 11 of 12
Surfaces for trenches in gravel streets or alleys shall be restored to their original shape

A. General - Pipe shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations
for installing the type of pipe used unless modified or changed on the special provisions.
The contractor shall provide all tools and equipment including any special tools designed
for installing each particular type of pipe used.
B. Dewatering of Trench - Where water is encountered in the trench, it shall be removed
during pipelaying operations and the trench so maintained until the ends of the pipe are
sealed and provisions are made to prevent floating of the pipe.
C. Responsibility for Material - The contractor shall be responsible for all material furnished
by him and shall replace at his own expense, all such material found defective in
manufacture or damage in handling after delivery by the manufacturer. This shall
include the furnishing of all materials and labor required for the replacement of installed
material discovered damaged or defective prior to the final acceptance of the work or
during the guarantee period.
The contractor shall be responsible for the safe and proper storage of material furnished
by him or to him and accepted by him and intended for the work, until it has been
incorporated in the completed project. The interior of all pipe and other accessories shall
be kept free from dirt and foreign matter at all times.
D. Handling of Pipe - All pipe furnished by the contractor shall be delivered and distributed
at the site by the contractor. Pipe, fittings, specials, valves and accessories shall be
loaded and unloaded by lifting with hoists or skidding so as to avoid shock or damage.
Under no circumstances shall such material be dropped. Pipe handled on skidways shall
not be skidded or rolled against pipe already on the ground.
In distributing the material at the site of the work, each piece shall be unloaded opposite 
Sect 301 page 5 of 17
or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench.
Pipe shall be so handled that the coating and lining will not be damaged. If, however,
any part of the coating or lining is damaged, the repair shall be made by the contractor at
his expense in a manner satisfactory to the engineer.
E. Laying of Pipe - Before installation, the pipe and pipe coating shall be inspected for
defects. Any damage to pipe coating shall be repaired with the same materials used for
the original coating before laying the pipe.
All pipe shall be laid and maintained to the required lines and grades with fittings and
valves at the required locations.
Grade and alignment on ungraded streets will be given from hubs set parallel to the line
of the pipe and on graded streets the grade and alignment shall be taken from established
points on the existing curbs or sidewalks, when directed by the engineer. Trenches for
the pipe shall be opened in accordance with the lines and grades given or to the standard
depth or cover provided in the Section 301.07. The contractor shall transfer lines and
grades to the pipe from hubs set by the Engineer or from existing concrete curbs or
sidewalks as an incidental part of this work.
Whenever obstructions not shown on the plans are encountered during the progress of the
work and interfere to such an extent that an alteration in the plan is required, the engineer
shall have the authority to change the plans and order a deviation from the line and grade
or arrange with the owners of the structures for the removal, relocation and
reconstruction of the obstructions. If the change in plans results in a change on the
amount of work by the contractor, such altered work shall be done on the basis of
payment to the contractor for extra work or credit to the owner for less work.
Proper implements, tools and facilities satisfactory to the engineer shall be provided and
used by the contractor for the safe and convenient prosecution of the work. All pipe,
fittings and valves hall be carefully lowered into the trench piece by piece by means of a
derrick, ropes or other suitable tools or equipment, in such a manner as to prevent
damage to pipe materials and protective coating and linings. Under no circumstances
shall materials be dropped or dumped into the trench.
Every precaution shall be taken to prevent foreign material from entering the pipe while
it is being placed in the line. During laying operations, no debris, tools, clothing or other
materials shall be placed in the pipe. All pipe shall be visibly inspected and all foreign
matter or dirt shall be removed from the interior and ends of pipe before they are lowered
into position in the trench. At times when pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of
the pipe shall be closed by a water-tight plug or other means approved by the engineer.
Long radius curves, either horizontal or vertical, may be laid with standard pipe by 
Sect 301 page 6 of 17
deflections at the joints. If the pipe is shown curved on the plans and no special fittings
are shown, the contractor can assume that the curves can be made by deflection of the
joints with standard lengths of pipe. If shorter lengths are required, the plan will indicate
maximum lengths that can be used.
Where field conditions require deflection or curves not anticipated by the plans, the
engineer will determine the methods to be used. No additional payment will be made for
laying pipe on curves as shown on the plans, nor for field changes involving standard
lengths of pipe deflected at joints. When fittings not shown on the plans are required to
meet field conditions, additional payment will be made for fittings.
Maximum deflections at pipe joints for various types of pipe shall not exceed the
applicable material and joint specifications of AWWA nor shall they exceed the
recommendations of the pipe manufacturer. When rubber gasketed pipe is laid on a
curve, the pipe shall be jointed in a straight alignment and then deflected to the curved
alignment. Trenches shall be made wide on curves for this purpose.
Reaction or thrust blocking shall be applied at all tees, plugs, caps and at bends deflecting
22½° or more, or movement shall be prevented by attaching suitable metal rods or straps
as approved by the engineer. Reaction blocking shall be concrete having a compressive
strength of not less than 2,000 pounds per square inch at 28 days. Blocking shall be
placed between solid ground and the fittings to be anchored; the area of bearing on the
pipe and on the ground shall be as shown on Standard Drawing 303-01. The blocking
shall be so placed that the pipe and fitting joints will be accessible for repair.
The cutting of pipe for inserting valves, fittings or closure pieces shall be done in a neat
and workmanlike manner without damage to the pipe or coating and so as to leave a
smooth end at right angles to the axis of the pipe. The flame cutting of pipe by means of
any oxyacetylene torch shall not be allowed.
SECTION 301.10 - PIPE JOINTING
A. Rubber Gasket "Push-On" Joints - Jointing of pipe and fittings with a rubber gasket
"push-on" joint shall be as recommended by the manufacturer. The rubber gasket and
gasket seat inside the bell shall be wiped clean with a cloth. A thin film of lubricant,
furnished with the pipe, shall be applied to the inside surface of the gasket. The plain end
of the adjoining pipe shall be wiped clean and inserted into the bell a sufficient distance
to make contact with the gasket. The plain end shall then be forced "home" by the use of
a crow bar, fork took or jack assembly. All "push-on" joint ductile iron pipe shall be
connected with three (3) driven brass wedges, for electrical conductivity.
B. Mechanical Joints - The inside of the bell and the outside of the spigot of the mechanical
joint fittings shall be brushed thoroughly with a wire brush to remove all loose rust or 
Sect 301 page 7 of 17
other foreign material just prior to assembly . The cleaned surfaces shall be brushed with
soapy water just prior to slipping the gasket over the spigot end and into the bell.
The spigot end of the pipe or fitting shall be accurately centered in the bell before
jointing is begun. After the gasket is in place the gland shall be brought up toward the
pipe flange evenly, maintaining approximately the same distance between the gland and
the face of the flange at all points around the socket. Bolts shall be partially tightened
alternately around the socket maintaining approximately equal tension until the final
tension is reached.
The normal range of bolt torques to be applied to the cast iron bolts in the joints shall be
as follows:
BOLT SIZE
(INCH)
RANGE OF TORQUE
(FT. LB.)
5/8 40 - 60
3/4 60 - 90
1 70 - 100
1 1/4 90 - 120
The above torque loads may be applied with torque measuring or indicating wrenches, or
they may be applied using regular socket wrenches and checked to torque wrenches.
In effective sealing is not attained at the maximum torque indicated above, the joint shall
be disassembled and reassembled after thorough cleaning. Over stressing of bolts to
compensate for poor installation practice with not be permitted.
C. Connection to Existing Mains - All connections to water mains in use shall be made by
the contractor unless otherwise provided in the special provisions. The contractor shall
furnish the special as shown on the plans and all other material required. He shall make
all necessary excavations to assure gradual transition between the new and existing water
main and he shall perform all necessary backfilling.
Where the connection of new work to old requires interruption of service and notification
of customers affected, the superintendent of the utility, the engineer and the contractor
shall mutually agree upon a date for connections which will allow ample time to
assemble labor and materials and to notify all customers affected.
SECTION 301.11 - PRESSURE TESTS - Test pressure shall be 150 +5 PSI. At points where
pressure reaction and movement may occur, the pipe shall be properly blocked or braced. Where 
Sect 301 page 8 of 17
permanent blocking is not required, the contractor shall furnish and install temporary blocking
during the test period. While under test pressure, the installation shall be carefully examined for
defective material replaced by the contractor. The duration of each pressure test will be two
hours unless otherwise specified by the engineer. Leakage during pressure test shall not exceed
that specified by the appropriate AWWA specifications for the size and type of pipe being used,
but in no case shall leakage exceed 13 gallons/inch diameter/mile/day. The contractor shall
furnish all labor, equipment and material to make the test.
A. General - It is the intent of this standard to present essential procedures for disinfecting
new and repaired water mains.
B. Basic Procedure - The basic procedure comprises:
(1) Preventing contaminating materials from entering the water mains during
construction or repair and removing by flushing materials that may have entered
the water main.
(2) Disinfecting any residual contamination that may remain.
(3) Determining the bacteriologic quality by laboratory test after disinfection.
C. Supplementary Information to Be Supplied by Engineer - When the disinfecting of water
mains is to be under a separate contract or as part of a contract for installing the mains,
the engineer shall provide the following items of specific information in his
supplementary specifications:
(1) Standard of reference; that is--AWWA C-601-81
(2) Places where flushing may be done, rates of flushing and location of drainage
facilities (Item E, Preliminary Flushing, and Table 1).
(3) Form of chlorine to be used (Item F, Form of Chlorine for Disinfection) and
method of application (Item G, Methods of Chlorine Application).
(4) The number of frequency of samples for bacteriologic tests (Item I, Bacteriologic
Tests).
(5) Method of taking samples (Item I, Bacteriologic Tests, Paragraph b).
(6) Disposal of chlorinated water shall meet requirements of the Water Quality
Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.
D. Preventive Measures During Construction
(1) Keeping Pipe Clean and Dry - Precautions shall be taken to protect pipe interior, 
Sect 301 page 9 of 17
fittings and valves against contamination. Pipe delivered for construction shall be
strung so as to minimize entrances of foreign material. When pipelaying is not in
progress, as, for example, at the close of the day's work, all openings in the
pipeline shall be closed by water-tight plugs. Joints of all pipe in the trench shall
be completed before work is stopped. If water accumulates in the trench, the
plugs shall remain in place until the trench is dry.
NOTE: Delay in placement of delivered pipe invites contamination. The more
closely the rate of delivery is correlated to the rate of pipelaying, the less the
contamination.
If dirt that, in the opinion of the owner's engineer or job superintendent, will not
be removed by the flushing operation (Item E, Preliminary Flushing) enters the
pipe, the interior of the pipe shall be cleaned and swabbed as necessary, with a
one percent (1%) hypochlorite disinfection solution.
(2) Packing Materials and Joints - No contaminated material or any material capable
of supporting prolific growth of micro-organism shall be used for sealing joints.
Packing material shall be handled in such a manner as to avoid contamination.
Yarning or packing material for cast iron pipe shall consist of molded or tubular
rubber rings, rope of asbestos or treated paper. Materials such as jute or hemp
shall not be used.
The lubricant used in the installation of sealing gaskets shall be suitable for use in
potable water. It shall be delivered to the job in enclosed containers and shall be
kept clean.
E. Preliminary Flushing - The main shall be flushed prior to disinfection except when the
tables method is used. (Item G, Methods of Chlorine Application, Paragraph c). The
sites and velocities of flushing shall be as specified in the supplemental specifications.
NOTE 1: The flushing velocity shall be not less than 2.5 ft/sec. The rate of flow
required to produce this velocity in various diameters is shown in Table 1. No site for
flushing should be chosen unless it has been determined that drainage is adequate at that
site.
NOTE 2: Flushing is no substitute or preventive measure taken before and during
pipelaying (Item D, Preventive Measures During construction). Certain contaminants,
especially in caked deposits, resist flushing at any velocity. Furthermore, with diameters
of 16 inches or more, even the minimum flushing velocity of 2.5 ft/sec. is sometimes
difficult to achieve.

F. Form of Chlorine for Disinfection - The most common forms of chlorine used in the
disinfecting solutions are liquid chlorine (gas at atmospheric pressure), calcium
hypochlorite granules, sodium hypochlorite solutions and calcium hypochlorite tablets.
(1) Liquid Chlorine - Liquid chlorine shall be used only when suitable equipment is
available and only under the direct supervision of a person familiar with the
physiological, chemical and physical properties of this element and who is
properly trained and equipped to handle any emergency that may arise.
Introduction of chlorine gas directly from the supply cylinder is unsafe and shall
not be permitted.
NOTE: The preferred equipment consists of a solution feed chlorinator in combination
with a booster pump for injecting the chlorine-gas water mixture into the main to be 
Sect 301 page 11 of 17
disinfected. Direct feed chlorinators are not recommended because their use is limited to
situations where the water pressure is lower than the chlorine cylinder pressure.
(2) Hypochlorites
(a) Calcium Hypochlorite - Calcium hypochlorite contains 70 percent (70%)
available chlorine by weight. It is either granular or tabular in form. The
tablets, 6-8 to the ounce, are designed to dissolve slowly in water (Item G,
Methods of Chlorine Application, para. c). Calcium hypochlorite is
packaged in containers of various types and sizes ranging from small
plastic bottles to 100 pound drums.
A chlorine-water solution is prepared by dissolving the granules in water
in the proportion requisite for the desired concentration.
(b) Sodium Hypochlorite - Sodium hypochlorite is supplied in strengths from
5.25 to 16 percent available chlorine. It is packaged in liquid form in
glass, rubber or plastic containers ranging in size from one-quart bottles to
five-gallon carboys. It may also be purchased in bulk for delivery by tank
truck.
The chlorine-water solution is prepared by adding hypochlorite to water.
Product deterioration must be reckoned with in computing the quantity of
sodium hypochlorite required for the desired concentration.
(c) Application - The hypochlorite solution shall be applied to the water main
with a gasoline or electrically-powered chemical feed pump designed for
feeding chlorine solutions. For small applications the solutions may be
fed with a hand pump, for example, a hydraulic test pump. Feed lines
shall be of such material and strength as to withstand safely the maximum
pressures that may be created by the pumps. All connections shall be
checked for tightness before the hypochlorite solution is applied to the
main.
G. Methods of Chlorine Application -
(1) Continuous Feed Method - This method is suitable for general application.
(a) Water from the existing distribution systems or other approved sources of
supply shall be made to flow at a constant, measured rate into the newlylaid pipeline. The water shall receive a dose of chlorine, also fed at a
constant, measured rate. The two rates shall be proportioned so that the
chlorine concentration in the water in the pipe is maintained at a minimum 
Sect 301 page 12 of 17
of 25 mg/l available chlorine. To assure that this concentration is
maintained, the chlorine residual should be measured at regular intervals.
NOTE: In the absence of a meter, the rate may be determined either by
placing a pitot gage at the discharge or by measuring the time to fill a
container of known volume.
Table 2 below gives the amount of chlorine residual required for each 100
feet of pipe of various diameters. Solutions of one percent (1%) chlorine
may be prepared with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. The
latter solution required approximately one pound of calcium hypochlorite
in 8.5 gallons of water.
(b) During the application of the chlorine, valves shall be manipulated to
prevent the treatment dosage from flowing back into the line supplying the
water. Chlorine application shall not cease until the entire main is filled
with the chlorine solution. The chlorinated water shall be retained in the
main for at least 24 hours, during which time all valves and hydrants in the
section treated shall be operated in order to disinfect the appurtenances.
At the end of this 24 hour period, the treated water shall contain no less
than 10 mg/l chlorine throughout the length of the main.

12 0.120 1.44
(2) Slug Method - This method is suitable for use with mains of large diameter for
which, because of the volummes of water involved, the continuous feed method is
not practical.
(a) Water from the existing distribution system or other approved source of 
Sect 301 page 13 of 17
supply shall be made to flow at a constant, measured rate (Item G,
Methods of Chlorine Application, Para. a, Note) into the newly-laid
pipeline. The water shall receive a does of chlorine, also fed at a constant,
measured rate. The two rates shall be proportioned so that the
concentration in the water entering the pipeline is maintained at no less
than 100 mg/l. The chlorine shall be applied continuously and for a
sufficient period to develop a solid column or "slug" of chlorinated water
that will, as it passes along the line, expose all interior surfaces to a
concentration of at least 50 mg/l for at least three (3) hours. The
application shall be checked at a tap near the upstream end of the line by
chlorine residual measurements.
(b) As chlorinated water flows tees and crosses, related valves and hydrants
shall be operated so as to disinfect appurtenances.
(3) Tablet Method - Tablet disinfection is best suited to short extensions (up to 2,500
feet) and smaller diameter mains (up to 12 inches). Because the preliminary
flushing step must be eliminated, this method shall be used only when scrupulous
cleanliness has been exercised. It shall not be used if trench water or foreign
material has entered the main or if the water is below 5° C (41°F).
(a) Placement of Tablets - Tablets are placed in each section of pipe and also
in hydrants, hydrant branches, and other appurtenances. They shall be
attached by an adhesive, except for the tablets placed in hydrants and in
the joints between the pipe sections. All the tablets within the main must
be at the top of the main. If the tablets are fastened before the pipe section
is placed in the trench their position should be marked on the section to
assure that there will be no rotation. In placing tablets in joints, they are
either crushed and placed on the inside annular space, or, if the type of
assembly does not permit, they are rubbed like chalk on the butt ends of
the sections to coat them with calcium hypochlorite.
The adhesive may be Permatex No. 1 (a product of the Permatex
Company, Brooklyn, New York and Kansas City, Kansas) or any
alternative approved by the Engineer. There shall be no adhesive on the
tablet except on the broad side next to the surface to which the tablet is
attached.
(b) Filling and Contact - When installation has been completed, the main shall
be filled with water at a velocity of less than one-foot/second. This water
shall remain in the pipe for at least 24 hours.
Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine solution in the line
being treated will not flow back into the line supplying the water.

* Based on 3.25g available chlorine per tablet.
H. Final Flushing - After the applicable retention period, the heavily chlorinated water shall
be flushed from the main until the chlorine concentration in the water leaving the main is
no higher than that generally prevailing in the system, or less than one mg/l. Chlorine
residual determination shall be made to ascertain that the heavily chlorinated water has
been removed from the pipeline.
I. Bacteriologic Tests -
(1) After final flushing and before the water main is placed in service, a sample or
samples shall be collected from the end of the line and tested for bacteriologic
quality and shall show the absence of coliform organisms. If the number and
frequency of samples is not prescribed by the public health authority having
jurisdiction, at least one sample shall be collected from chlorinated supplies
where a chlorine residual is maintained throughout the new main.
NOTE: In case of extremely long mains, it is desirable that samples be collected
the length of the line as well as at its end.
(2) Samples for bacteriologic analysis shall be collected in sterile bottles treated with
sodium thiosulfate. No hose or fire hydrant shall be used in collection of samples.
 A suggested sampling tap consists of a standard corporation cock installed in the
main with a copper tube gooseneck assembly. After samples have been collected,
the gooseneck assembly may be removed and retained for future use.
J. Repetition of Procedure - If the initial disinfection fails to produce satisfactory samples, 
Sect 301 page 15 of 17
disinfection shall be repeated until satisfactory samples have been obtained. The tablet
method cannot be used in these subsequent disinfections. When the samples are
satisfactory, the main may be placed in service.
K. Procedure After Cutting Into or Repairing Existing Mains - The procedures outlined in
this section apply primarily when mains are wholly or partially dewatered. Leaks or
breaks that are repaired with clamping device while the mains remain full of water under
pressure present little danger or contamination and require no disinfection.
(1) Trench "Treatment" - When an old line is opened, either by accident or by design,
the excavation will likely be wet and badly contaminated from nearby sewers.
Liberal quantities of hypochlorite applied to open trench areas will lessen the
danger from such pollution. Tablets have the advantage in such a situation
because they dissolve slowly and continue to release hypochlorite as water is
pumped from the excavation.
(2) Main Disinfection -
(a) Swabbing and Flushing - The following procedure is considered as a
minimum that may be used.
(b) Swabbing with Hypochlorite Solution - The interior of all pipe and fittings
used in making the repair (particularly couplings and tapping sleeves)
shall be swabbed with a one percent (1%) hypochlorite solution before
they are installed.
(c) Flushing - Thorough flushing is the most practical means of removing
contamination introduced during repairs. If valving and hydrant locations
permit, flushing from both directions is recommended. Flushing shall be
started as soon as the repairs are completed and continued until discolored
water is eliminated.
(d) Slug Method - Where practicable, in addition to the procedures of
Paragraph 2, SWABBING with HYPOCHLORITE SOLUTION, a section
of main in which the break is located shall be isolated, all service
connections shut off, and the section flushed and chlorinated as described
in Item G, METHODS OF CHLORINE APPLICATION, Paragraph b,
SLUG METHOD, except that the dose may be increased as much as 300
mg/l, and the contact time reduced to as little as fifteen (15) minutes.
After chlorination, flushing shall be resumed and continued until
discolored water is eliminated.
(3) Sampling - Bacteriologic sampling shall be taken after repairs to provide a
record by which the effectiveness of the procedures used can be 
Sect 301 page 16 of 17
determined. If the direction of flow is unknown, samples shall be taken on
each side of the main break.
SECTION 301.13 - SEPARATION OF WATER MAINS AND SEWERS - The minimum
horizontal separation shall be to ten feet where the invert of the water main is less than 18 inches
above the crown of the sewer line. The minimum vertical separation shall be 18 inches at
crossings. Joints in sewer crossings shall be equidistant from water mains. The upper line of a
crossing shall be specially supported.
Where vertical and/or horizontal clearance cannot be maintained, the sewer or water main shall
be placed in a separate casing pipe, as shown on the City of Lander Standard Drawing No.
402.02.
SECTION 301.14 - AIR RELIEF VALVES, BLOW-OFFS, FLUSHING HYDRANTS -
These shall meet pressure and flow requirements equal to or exceeding the main installation or
as required by the manufacturer.

SECTION 401.10 TESTS
A. T.V. Inspection - In the event a sewer installation fails to pass any required test after
usual and customary methods of repair have been employed by the contractor, the City
may, at their option, require any or all sewer mains to be inspected by the use of a
television camera before final acceptance. The cost incurred in making the initial
inspection shall be borne by the owner. The contractor will turn over to the City a copy
of the video (VCR) tape as a record of the test and any repairs.
The contractor shall bear all costs incurred in correcting any deficiencies found during
television inspection including the cost of any additional television inspection that may
be required by the City to verify the correction of said deficiency.
The contractor shall be responsible for all costs incurred in any television inspection
performed solely for the benefit of the contractor.
B. Leakage Test - New sewer lines will not be finally accepted until leakage tests have been
made to assure the engineer that pipe laying and jointing are satisfactory.
1. Water Test - Where groundwater is above the sewer line, tests shall be made by
sealing off the section of lines between manholes and measuring the actual flow
by collecting or pumping the discharge into barrels or other approved methods.
Tests shall be continued over a period of at least four (4) hours for each section
tested. Sufficient time shall be allowed to soak lines and manholes in advance of
performing tests.
When ground water is not above the pipe, testings shall be as follows: On flat
slopes where the depth over the centerline of the pipe in the lower manhole of the
section being tested will not be more than ten feet (10'), the upper manhole shall
be filled to a depth of two feet (2') over the top of the pipe and the lower manhole
blocked. When the above conditions cannot be met, the engineer may order the
contractor to test the line in sections between manholes. The leakage shall be
measured by checking the drop in water level in the manhole over a period of four
(4) hours.
The maximum allowable infiltration or exfiltration, including manholes, shall not
exceed 200 gallons per day per mile of sewer, per inch of pipe diameter. This
does not preclude the fact that obvious and concentrated leaks, such as open joints,
pinched gaskets, cracked barrels or bells, etc., will not be allowed. The contractor
shall make repairs on concentrated leaks and as necessary to reduce infiltration or
exfiltration leakage below the specified rate and at his own expense. Allowable
leakage below the specified rate and at his own expense. Allowable leakage in
gallons/24 hours shall not exceed: (length of line in feet)(pipe diameters in
inches)(0.03788). 
Sect 401 page 8 of 11
2. Air Test (Alternate) - As an alternate method of water testing, the contractor may
utilize low pressure air as a means of testing the sewer mains. The procedure shall
be as described below:
Plug both ends of the pipe under test with air-tight plugs and brace adequately to
prevent slippage and blowout. One plug shall have an inlet tap or other provision
for connecting an air hose.
The air supply hose, connected between the air compressor and the plug, shall
have a throttling valve, an air bleed valve and a high pressure shut-off valve for
control. The low pressure side of the throttling valve shall have a tee for a
monitoring pressure gauge, protected by a gauge cock. This cock is kept closed
except when the pressure loss is being timed.
If the pipeline is submerged under ground water, the back pressure, caused by the
water head, is measured and added to the standard test pressures to compensate for
the ground water effect on the air test.
Air shall be applied slowly to the pipe line until the pressure reaches 4.0 psig. The
air supply shall then be throttled so that the internal pressure is maintained
between 4.0 and 3.5 psig for at least two (2) minutes. During this time the plugs
shall be checked with soap solution to detect any plug leakage.
When the pressure reaches exactly 3.5 psig, a stop watch is started and the time
recorded for the pressure to drop to 2.5 psig. The minimum time allowed for this
pressure drop shall be computed based on an air loss rate of 2.0 cfm or an air loss
rate of 0.0030 cfm per square foot of inner pipe surface under test, whichever rate
gives the least time for the pressure drop. Should the time of the pressure drop
between 3.5 and 2.5 psig be less than the allowable specified time, the contractor
shall make the necessary leakage repairs and repeat the air test.
Table 1 on page 10 provides a Nomograph which may be used to compute testing
times for air testing.
Manhole joints shall be checked for leakage by means of water testing as specified
above.
C. Deflection Testing - After the pipe has been laid and backfilled, all pipe shall be tested
for deflection in the presence of the engineer. The test shall consist of pulling a
deflection gauge through the pipe. The maximum deflection allowable shall not exceed
5%, as set forth in the table below, the final inspection. The contractor shall conduct the
test and shall furnish all necessary test equipment and labor. The contractor's gauge shall

SECTION 501.09 - CONSTRUCTION METHODS
A) Handling, Measuring and Batching Materials - Concrete of the classes specified shall be
made up of acceptable material batched in the proportions specified by the laboratory mix
design, corrections necessitated by variations in the moisture content of the component
materials or for other similar reasons shall be made as directed, based upon laboratory
and field determination.
The contractor may weigh or measure the water and admixtures. The cement by weight
or sacks, the fine Aggregate and coarse aggregate shall be weighed.
1) Water - The water shall be measured either by volume or weight. The allowable
error in accuracy of water measuring or weighing equipment shall not be more
than .5%. The weighing equipment shall be so arranged that the accuracy of the
measurement will not be affected by variations in pressure in the water supply
lines. When water is measured by volume, it shall be metered through an
approved water meter devise.
2) Cement - Cement may be measured either by weight or by sacks. A sack shall
mean 94 pound bags as packed by the manufacturer. If the volume method is
used, cement in all batches of concrete mixed shall be in full sacks. No batch shall
be mixed using fractional sacks of cement. When cement is measured by weight,
it shall be weighed on a separate scale which is accurate and maintained within a
maximum tolerance of one percent (1%) of the load being weighed.
3) Bins and Scales - The batching plant shall be equipped with suitable bins and
weighing hoppers.
The scales shall be of either the beam or springless dial type. The scales shall be
so equipped and the dials so graduated that the weights of materials being weighed
can be accurately determined. Scales shall be accurate to .05% throughout the
range of use. Poises shall be designed to be secured in any position to prevent
inadvertent change of position. Scales shall be either sealed or checked, or both,
as often as the engineer deems necessary to assure their continued accuracy. For
the purpose of checking scales, the contractor shall keep not fewer than ten (10)
50-pound weights at the plant site at all times. 
Sect 501 page 7 of 13
Means of control shall be provided so that, as the quantity desired in the weighing
hopper is being approached, the material may be added slowly and shut off with
precision.
Batching plants may be equipped to proportion aggregates and bulk cement by
automatic weighing devices of an approved type.
4) Batching - When batches are hauled to the mixer, bulk cement shall be transported
either in waterproof compartments or between the fine and coarse aggregates.
When cement is placed in contact with the aggregates, batches may be rejected
unless mixed within 1 ½ hours of such contact. Sacked cement may be
transported on top of the aggregates.
Batches shall be delivered to the mixer separate and intact. Each batch shall be
dumped cleanly into the mixer without loss. When more than one batch is carried
on the truck, no spilling of material from one batch compartment into another will
be allowed.
B) Mixing - Materials for concrete shall be handled, measured and batched in accordance
with Section 501.07, Composition of Concrete. Concrete shall be thoroughly mixed in a
manner to positively insure a uniform distribution of the materials throughout the mass.
Concrete shall be mixed only in quantities required for immediate use and shall be used
within the time limits specified. Any concrete in which initial set has begun shall be
wasted. Aggregates, or bags of cement, containing lumps or crusts of hardened material
shall not be used.
C) Ready Mixed Concrete - Ready-mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered to the site
of the work by means of one of the following combinations of operations.
1) Mixed completely in a stationary mixer and the mixed concrete transported to the
point of delivery in truck agitators or in non-agitating hauling equipment (known
as central-mixed concrete).
2) Mixed partially in a stationary mixer and the mixing completed in a truck mixer
(known as shrink-mixed concrete).
3) Mixed completely in a truck mixer (known as transit-mixed concrete).
Mixers may be stationary mixers or truck mixers. Agitators may be truck mixers
operating at agitation speed or truck agitators. Each mixer and agitator shall have
attached thereto in a prominent place a metal plate or plates on which is plainly marked
the various uses for which the equipment is designed, the manufacturer's guaranteed 
Sect 501 page 8 of 13
capacity of the drum or container in terms of the volume of mixed concrete and the speed
of rotation of the mixing drum or blades.
Truck mixers shall be equipped with electrically or mechanically actuated counters by
which the number of revolutions of the drum or blades may be readily verified. The
counter shall be actuated at the time the actual mixing is started at mixing speeds.
Truck mixers shall be loaded not to exceed the manufacturer's rated capacity. They shall
combine the ingredients of the concrete into a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass and
discharge the concrete with a satisfactory degree of uniformity.
When a truck mixer is used for complete mixing, each batch of concrete shall be mixed
for not less than 70 nor more than 100 revolutions of the drum or blades at the rate of
rotation designated by the manufacturer of the equipment on the metal plate on the mixer,
as mixing speed. Additional mixing, if any, shall be at the speed designated by the
manufacturer of the equipment as agitating speed. All materials, including mixing water,
shall be in the mixer drum before actuating the revolution counter for determination of
the number of revolutions actually used for mixing.
When shrink-mixed concrete is furnished, concrete that has been partially mixed at a
central plant shall be transferred to a truck mixer and all requirements for transit-mixed
concrete shall apply. No credit in the number of revolutions at mixing speed shall be
allowed for partial mixing in a central plant.
Mixed concrete may be transported to the delivery point in truck agitators or truck mixers
operating at the speed designated by the manufacturer of the equipment is agitating
speed, or non-agitating hauling equipment, provided the consistency and workability is
suitable for adequate placement and consolidation in place.
In hot weather or under conditions contributing to quick stiffening of the concrete, or
when the temperature of the concrete is 85° F. (30° C.) or above, the time between the
introduction of the cement to the aggregates and discharge shall not exceed 60 minutes.
When a truck mixer is used for the complete mixing of the concrete, the mixing operation
shall begin within 45 minutes after the cement has been added to the aggregate.
Truck agitators shall be loaded not to exceed the manufacturer's rated capacity. They
shall maintain the mixed concrete in a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass during
hauling.
Bodies of non-agitating hauling equipment shall be so constructed that leakage of the
concrete mix, or any part thereof, will not occur at any time and they shall be selfcleaning during discharge.
Concrete hauled in open-top vehicles shall be protected during hauling against access of
rain or exposure to the sun for more than 20 minutes when the ambient temperature 
Sect 501 page 9 of 13
exceeds 75 degrees F.
Additional mixing water may be incorporated into the concrete at the delivery point,
upon approval of the engineer. When additional water is to be incorporated into the
concrete, the drum shall be revolved not less than 30 revolutions at mixing speed after the
water is added and before discharge is commenced.
The rate of discharge of mixed concrete from truck-mixer agitators shall be controlled by
the speed of rotation of the drum in the discharge direction with the discharge gate fully
open.
When a truck mixer or agitator is used for transporting concrete to the delivery point,
discharge shall be completed within 1 1/2 hours or before 300 revolutions of the drum or
blades, whichever comes first, after the introduction of the cement to the aggregates.
When non-agitating hauling equipment is used for transporting concrete to the delivery
point, discharge shall be completed within one hour after the addition of the cement to
the aggregates. Under conditions contributing to quick stiffening of the concrete, or
when the temperature of the concrete is 80 degrees F., or above, the time between the
introduction of cement to the aggregates and discharge shall not exceed 45 minutes.
Each batch of ready-mixed concrete delivered at the job site shall be accompanied by a
ticket showing volume of concrete, the weight of cement in pounds, and the total weight
of all ingredients in pounds, unless otherwise ordered by the engineer. The ticket shall
also show the time of day which the materials were batched and discharged.
D. On-Site Mixed Concrete - For mixing at the site of construction or at a central point,
concrete shall be mixed in a batch mixer of an approved type. No mixer having a rated
capacity of less than a one-bag batch shall be used nor shall a mixer be charged in excess
of its rated capacity. The batch shall be so charged into the drum that a portion of the
water shall enter in advance of the cement and aggregate. The flow of water shall be
uniform and all water shall be in the drum by the end of the first 15 seconds of the mixing
period. Mixing time shall be measured from the time all material, except water, are in the
drum. Mixing time shall be not less than 60 seconds for mixers having a capacity of two
cubic yards, the mixing time shall be not less than 90 seconds.
The mixer shall be operated at a drum speed as shown on the manufacturer's name plate
on the mixer. The volume of mixed concrete shall not exceed the mixer's normal
capacity in cubic feet as shown on the A.G.C. standard rating plate on the mixer, when
the mixer is operated in a level position. Any concrete mixed less than the specified time
shall be discarded and disposed of by the contractor at his own expense.
SECTION 501.10 - HOT AND COLD WEATHER REQUIREMENTS
Sect 501 page 10 of 13
A. Cold Weather Concrete - When concrete is being placed during cold weather and the air
temperature may be expected to fall below 35° F., the concrete surface shall be
maintained at a temperature of not less than 50° F., for at least 72 hours.
Concrete delivered in outdoor temperatures lower than 40° F. shall arrive at the work
having a temperature not less than 50° F. nor greater than 90° F.
Aggregates and mixing water shall be heated to temperature of at least 70° F., but not
more than 150° F. the aggregates may be heated by either steam or dry heat. Heating
equipment or methods which alter or prevent the entrainment of the required amount of
air or which develop hot spots in the aggregate shall not be used.
B. Hot Weather Requirements
1) In hot weather, suitable precautions shall be taken to avoid drying of the concrete
prior to finishing operations. Use of windbreaks, sunshades, fog sprays or other
devices shall be provided as directed by the architect or engineer.
2) Concrete deposited in hot weather shall not have a placing temperature that will
cause difficulty from loss of slump, flash set or cold joints.
SECTION 501.11 - PLACING
A. Concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable in its final position to avoid
segregation due to rehandling or flowing. Concrete shall be placed at such a rate that it is
at all times plastic and flows readily between bars. No concrete contaminated by foreign
material shall be used, nor shall retempered concrete be used unless approved by the
architect or engineer.
B. When placing is started, it shall be carried on as a continuous operation until placement
of the panel or section is completed.
C. All concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated during placement. It shall be thoroughly
worked around reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into the corners of the forms
without segregation.
D. Subgrade on which concrete is to be placed shall be moist at the time concrete is placed.
SECTION 501.12 - CURING CONCRETE - Immediately after forms have been removed, all
concrete shall be cured by the water or impervious compound methods as described herein.
Surfaces protected by forms for five days or more will not require curing, except that unoiled
wood forms shall be kept moist by sprinkling. 
Sect 501 page 11 of 13
A. Water Method - The concrete shall be kept continuously wet by the application of water
for a minimum period of five days after the concrete has been placed.
Cotton mats, rugs, carpets, burlap, or sand blankets are to be used to retain the moisture,
the entire surface of the concrete shall be kept damp by applying water with a nozzle that
so atomizes the flow that a mist and not a spray is formed, until the surface of the
concrete is covered with the curing medium. The moisture from the nozzle shall not be
applied under pressure directly upon the concrete and shall not be allowed to accumulate
on the concrete in a quantity sufficient to cause a flow or wash the surface. At the
expiration of the curing period, the concrete surface shall be cleared of all curing
mediums.
When concrete flat slabs are to be cured without the use of a moisture retaining medium,
the entire surface of the slab shall be kept damp by the application of water with an
atomizing nozzle as specified above until the concrete has set, after which the entire
surface of the concrete shall be sprinkled continuously with water for a period of not less
than five days.
B. Impervious Curing Compound - All surfaces shall be given the required surface finish
prior to application of impervious curing compound. During the finishing period, the
concrete shall be protected by the water method of curing.
The rate of application of a curing compound will be as prescribed by the engineer, with
a minimum spreading rate per application of one gallon of liquid coating for 300 square
feet of concrete surface. All concrete cured by this method shall receive two applications
of the curing compound. The first coat shall be applied immediately after stripping of
forms and acceptance of the concrete finish. If the surface is dry, the concrete shall be
thoroughly wet with water and the curing compound applied just as the surface film of
water disappears. The second application shall be applied after the first application has
set. During curing operations, any unsprayed surfaces shall be kept we with water.
Impervious curing compound may be white pigmented, clear or translucent.
The coating shall be protected against marring for a period of at least ten days after
applications. Any coating marred or otherwise disturbed shall be given an additional
coating.
When an impervious curing compound is used, the compound shall be thoroughly mixed
within an hour before use.
If the use of an impervious curing compound results in a streaked or blotchy appearance,
the method shall be stopped and the water curing as set out in paragraph (a) on the
previous page, applied until the cause of the defective appearance is corrected. 
Sect 501 page 12 of 13
SECTION 501.13 TESTING -
A. Aggregate - If required by the engineer the contractor shall, before starting concrete
work, furnish representative samples of concrete aggregate proposed for use to a testing
laboratory designated by the engineer and to be sampled in accordance with ASTM D-75.
B. Standard Slump Tests - The engineer shall regularly during each day's placement check
the consistency of the concrete by means of a slump test. A slump test shall also be made
each time that a test cylinder is made. Slump tests shall be made in accordance with the
"Method of Test for the Slump of Portland Cement Concrete," ASTM Designation C143.
C. Compression Tests - As required by the engineer, a set of at least four standard six-inch
test cylinders shall be made and tested for every concrete placement, and one set of tests
cylinders shall be made for every 100 yards of concrete or fraction thereof placed in each
placement. These cylinders should be cured under laboratory conditions except that
additional test cylinders cured entirely under field conditions may be required by the
engineer to check the adequacy of curing and protection of the concrete. All specimens
shall be taken to the engineer or engineer's representative. The engineer shall transport
all specimens to the testing laboratory in a safe and approved manner.
Test cylinders shall be made and laboratory cured in accordance with the standard
method of making and curing concrete compression specimens in the field (ASTM C-31).
 Cylinders shall be tested by an independent testing laboratory, as approved by the
engineer, and all charges made for testing cylinders shall be paid for by the owner.
Of each of the four cylinders taken for a pour, two shall be tested for strength at seven
days and two tested for strength at 28 days. To conform to the requirements of this
specification, the average of any three consecutive strength tests of the laboratory-cured
cylinders representing each class of concrete shall be equal to or greater than the
specified strength and not more than 20% of the strength tests shall have valves less than
the specified strength. A test shall consist of two cylinders broken at 28 days.
When concrete fails to conform to the requirements above or when tests of field-cured
cylinders indicate deficiencies in protection and curing, the owner's representative may
order tests on the hardened concrete as described in the ACI Building Code (ACI 301)
for that portion of the structure where the questionable concrete has been placed.
Compensation will be allowed for load tests or coring. In the event the load or core tests
indicate that the structure is unsatisfactory, the contractor shall, at his own expense, make
such modifications as required by the engineer to make the structure sound.
D. Air Content Tests - The engineer shall regularly during each day's placement, check the
air content by either the "Method of Test for Air Content of Freshly Mixed Concrete by
the Pressure Method" (ASTM C-231) or "Method of Test for Air Content of Freshly 
Sect 501 page 13 of 13
Mixed Concrete by the Volummetric Method" (ASTM C-173). An air content test shall
also be made by the engineer each time a compression test cylinder is made.
E. Unit Weight Test - Each time a compression test cylinder is made, a unit weight test shall
be made in accordance with ASTM C-138.

lines. The subgrade shall be reasonably dense, firm, trimmed to a uniform smooth surface and in
a moist condition when the concrete is placed. No concrete placement will be allowed on a
spongy or frozen subgrade.
SECTION 503.09 - CONCRETE PLACEMENT - 
Sect 503 page 3 of 5
The concrete shall be placed either by an approved slipform/extrusion machine, by the formed
method, or by the combination of these methods.
A. Machine Placement - The slipform/extrusion machine approved shall be so designed as to
place, spread, consolidate, screed and finish the concrete in one complete pass in such a
manner that a minimum of hand finishing will be necessary to provide a dense and
homogeneous concrete section. The machine shall shape, vibrate and/or extrude the
concrete for the full width and depth of the concrete section being placed. It shall be
operated with as nearly as continuous forward movement as possible. All operations of
mixing, delivery and spreading concrete shall be so coordinated as to provide uniform
progress, with stopping and starting of the machine held to a minimum.
B. Formed Method - The forms shall be of wood, metal or other suitable material that is
straight and free from warp, having sufficient strength to resist the pressure of the
concrete without displacement and sufficient tightness to prevent the leakage of mortar.
Flexible or rigid forms of proper curvature may be used for curbs having a radius of 100
feet or less. Division plates shall be metal.
The front and back forms shall extend for a full depth of the concrete. All of the forms
shall be braced and staked so that they remain in both horizontal and vertical alignment
until their removal. They shall be cleaned and coated with an approved form-release
agent before concrete is placed against them.
The concrete shall be deposited into the forms without segregation and then it shall be
tamped and spaded or mechanically vibrated for thorough consolidation. Low roll or
mountable curbs may be formed without the use of a face form by using a straightedge
and template to form the curb face.
When used, face forms shall be removed as soon as possible to permit finishing. Front
and back forms shall be removed without damage to the concrete after it has set.
SECTION 503.10 - FINISHING -
The plastic concrete shall be finished smooth, if necessary, by means of a wood float and then it
shall be given a final surface texture using a light broom or burlap drag. Concrete that is
adjacent to forms and formed joints shall be edged with a suitable edging tool to the dimensions
shown on the plans.
SECTION 503.11 - JOINTING -
A. Contraction Joints - Transverse weakened-plane contraction joints shall be constructed at
right angles to the curb line at intervals not exceeding ten feet on curb and gutter or
monolithic curb, gutter and sidewalk. Joint depth shall have a minimum depth of 3/4".
Contraction joint intervals on separately formed sidewalks shall not exceed five feet. 
Sect 503 page 4 of 5
Contraction joints may be sawed, hand formed or made by 1/8 inch thick division plates
in the form work. Sawing shall be done early after the concrete has set to prevent the
formation of uncontrolled cracking. The joints may be hand-formed either by (1) using a
narrow or triangular jointing tool or a thin metal blade to impress a plane of weakness into
the plastic concrete, or (2) inserting 1/8 inch thick steel strips withdrawn before final
finishing of the concrete. Where division plates are used to make contraction joints, the
plates shall be removed after the concrete has set and while the forms are still in place.
B. Expansion Joints - Expansion joints shall be constructed at right angles to the curb line at
immovable structures and at points of curvature for short-radius curves. Filler material
for expansion joints shall conform to requirements of AASHTO M-213, ASTM D-994, D1751 or D-1752 and shall be furnished in a single ½ inch thick piece for the full depth and
width of the joint.
Expansion joints in a slip formed curb and gutter or curb, gutter and sidewalk shall be
constructed with an appropriate hand tool by raking or sawing through partially set
concrete for the full depth and width of the section. The cut shall be only wide enough to
permit a snug fit for the joint filler.
After the filler is placed, open areas adjacent to the filler shall be filled with concrete and
then troweled and edged.
Alternately, an expansion joint may be installed by removing a short section of freshly
extruded curb, gutter and sidewalk immediately, installing temporary holding forms,
placing the expansion joint filler and replacing and reconsolidating the concrete that was
removed. Contaminated concrete shall be discarded.
C. Other Jointing - Construction joints may be either butt or expansion type joints. Curbs
and gutters constructed adjacent to existing concrete shall have the same type of joints as
in the existing concrete, with similar spacing' however, contraction joint spacing shall not
exceed ten feet.
SECTION 503.12 - PROTECTION -
The contractor shall always have materials available to protect the surface of the plastic concrete
against rain. These materials shall consist of water proof paper or plastic sheeting. For slipform
construction, materials such as wood planks or forms to protect the edges shall also be required.
Hot and cod weather protection shall be in accordance with Section 501.10 HOT AND COLD
WEATHER REQUIREMENTS.
SECTION 503.13 - CURING - 
Sect 503 page 5 of 5
Curing shall be in accordance with Section 501.12, CURING CONCRETE.
SECTION 503.14 - BACKFILLING -
After the concrete has set sufficiently, the spaces in front and back of curbs shall be refilled with
suitable material to the required elevations. The fill material shall be thoroughly tamped in
layers.
SECTION 503.15 - TOLERANCES -
The work shall be performed in a manner which results in a curb, gutter and sidewalk
constructed to specified line and grade, uniform in appearance and structurally sound. Curb,
gutter and sidewalk found with unsightly bulges, ridges, low spots in the gutter or other defects
shall be removed and replaced at the contractor's expense if the engineer considers them to be
irreparable. When checked with a ten foot (10') straightedge, grade shall not deviate more than
¼ inch and alignment shall not vary more than ½ inch.

cross section and compaction requirements after the frost is out of the ground and
the embankment is in suitable condition for work.
D. Density Requirements - The contractor shall provide watering and rolling as
required to obtain the density of 95% of maximum dry density for all the
embankment placed and no separate pay compensation shall be allowed for rolling
and watering other than the earthwork bid item or items listed on the proposal. In
the case of embankment material with Plasticity Indexes greater than zero, as
determined by ASTM D-424, the amount of water required for rolling shall be
within plus two percentage points of optimum moisture content as determined by
AASHTO T-99.
Tests for laboratory and field densities shall be performed in accordance with
Section 601.10, Compaction Control Test, below.
SECTION 601.10 - COMPACTION CONTROL TESTS
A. Description - This specification shall govern the determination of the maximum density,
field density and percent compaction of those materials for which a minimum percent
compaction is specified. It covers the basic procedure to be followed in performing the
test for maximum density and describes several procedures that may be used to determine
the field density and percent compaction.
In all cases density shall be started as the dry weight in pounds per cubic foot.
B. Maximum Density - Maximum density is defined as the maximum dry weight in pounds
per cubic foot obtained when a material is mixed with different percentages of water an
compacted in a standard manner. The percentage of water at which maximum density is
obtained is termed the optimum moisture content.
C. Laboratory Compaction Tests - The maximum density shall be determined by the
appropriate method shown below:
1. Where all of the material passes a No. 4 Sieve, use AASHTO T-99, Method A (or B).
2. Where the material contains particles larger than a No. 4 Sieve, use AASHTO T-99,
Method C (or D).
3. Where the material contains particles larger than 3/4 inch follow the replacement
procedure give to the note under Method C of AASHTO T-99.
D. Field Density - Field density refers to the dry density expressed in pounds per cubic foot
of a layer of compacted material in place at the site as determined by a sample
representative of the compacted layer. 
Sect 601 page 6 of 7
The field density shall be determined in accordance with AASHTO T-147, AASHTO T181, ASTM D-1556, ASTM D-2922 or other methods approved by the engineer.
E. Percent Compaction - The percent compaction is defined as the density of the compacted
layer expressed as a percentage of the maximum density of the material when tested in
accordance with these specifications.
The percentage of compaction is computed by the formula:
Percent Compaction = Field Density X 100

"Borrow Excavation" shall consist of excavation made from borrow areas within the project
limits and outside the normal grading limits for the completion of embankments.
Borrow areas or areas within the project limits from which the borrow may be obtained will be
designated on the plans.
Borrow excavation shall be made only at those designated located and within the horizontal and
vertical limits as stated or directed. On completion of borrow operations, the borrow area will be
adequately drained and finished to a neat and uniform grade acceptable to the engineer.
The borrow excavation shall be handled and placed as specified in Section 601.09, Embankment.
SECTION 601.12 - IMPORTED BORROW EXCAVATION DEFINED
"Imported Borrow Excavation" shall consist of excavation made from borrow areas outside the
project limits and outside the normal grading limits for the completion of the embankments.
Borrow areas or areas outside the project pits from which the imported borrow may be obtained
will be designated. However, any source chosen by the contractor will be subject to the approval
of the engineer.
The Imported Borrow Excavation shall be handled and placed as specified in Section 601.09,
Embankment.
A. Description - After the earthwork has been substantially completed and after all
underground utilities, manholes, catch basins, valve boxes, etc., have been installed or
adjusted to grade, the subgrade shall be brought to the lines, grades and cross sections
shown on the plans and compacted to the required density.
B. Construction Methods - All soft and unstable material and other portions of the subgrade 
Sect 601 page 7 of 7
which, in the opinion of the engineer, cannot be compacted satisfactorily shall be removed
to lines and grades as directed by the engineer.
All boulders appearing in the earth excavation shall be removed or broken off to a depth
of not less than four inches (4") below subgrade. All rock sections shall be brought to
grade by depositing a satisfactory cushion material to a depth authorized by the engineer.
If the surface of an old stone or gravel roadbed conforms approximately to the surface of
the finished subgrade, such sections shall be scarified superficially for the full width of
the subgrade to a depth sufficient to eliminate all depressions and to permit uniform
reshaping and compaction.
At all times ditches and drains along the subgrade shall be so maintained as to drain
effectively. When ruts of two inches (2") or more in depth are formed, the subgrade shall
be brought to grade and if necessary be reshaped and rerolled. In no case shall any
surface course or pavement be placed on a frozen or muddy subgrade. The top six inches
(6") of the subgrade shall have a minimum compacted density as is specified for
"Embankment".
In addition, the finished grade shall not deviate more than one-tenth foot (1/10') as to any
point from the staked elevation. Until the subgrade has been checked and approved, no
surface course or pavement shall be laid thereon. Under the square yard method of
measurement and payment the contractor has the option of deviating from the above
tolerances as long as the specified base course section and profile is maintained.
Base course material meeting the specified gradation and thickness shall be placed on the
prepared subgrade and compacted in six inch (6") layers to the minimum compacted
density as is specified for "Embankment".
Grades shall be constructed to those shown on the plans or as directed by the engineer.
The fill areas shall be compacted to not less than 90% of maximum density or equal to the
density or equal to the density of undisturbed adjacent material, whichever is greater. The
contractor shall use borrow or fill material reasonably free of refuse, stumps, broken
concrete and large rocks.

 ROAD MIX BITUMINOUS PAVEMENTS
Sect 607B page 1 of 4
SECTION 607B
 ROAD MIX BITUMINOUS PAVEMENTS
607B.01 - DESCRIPTION
These specifications include general requirements that are applicable to all types of road mix
bituminous pavements irrespective of the gradation of aggregate, kind and the amount of
bituminous material or pavement used.
This work shall consist of constructing one or more courses of a road mix bituminous mixture on
the prepared foundation in accordance with these specifications and in reasonably close
conformity with the lines, grades, thicknesses and typical cross-sections on the plans or
established by the engineer.
607B.02 - BITUMINOUS MATERIALS
The type and grade of bituminous material will be specified in the contract plans. The grade
may be changed one step by the engineer during construction at no change in unit price.
The bituminous material shall meet the applicable requirements of Section 608A, Bituminous
Materials.
607B.03 - AGGREGATES
The aggregates shall meet the requirements of Section 607A, Aggregates.
The aggregate will be accepted immediately preceding addition of bituminous material to the
mix. This acceptance will be based on periodic samples of the windrow after all aggregates have
been blended for each lift.
Stockpiled material shall meet the requirements of Section 607A.19, Stockpiled Aggregates.
607B.04 - WEATHER LIMITATIONS
The construction of road mix bituminous pavement shall be carried on only when the surface on
which the material is to be placed is dry and when the atmospheric temperature is above 50
degrees F and has not been below 40 degrees F during the preceding 24 hours.
607B.05 - EQUIPMENT
The equipment used by the Contractor shall include scarifying, mixing, spreading, finishing and
compacting equipment, a bituminous distributor and equipment for heating bituminous material.
 The distributor shall be so designed, equipped, maintained and operated that bituminous
material at even heat may be applied uniformly on variable widths of surface up to 15 feet at 
Sect 607B page 2 of 4
readily determined and controlled rates, from 0.05 to 2.0 gallons per square yard, with uniform
pressure and with an allowable variation from any specified rate not to exceed 0.02-gallon per
square yard. Distributor equipment shall include a tachometer, pressure gauges, accurate volume
measuring devices or a calibrated tank and thermometer for measuring temperatures of tank
contents. Distributors shall be equipped with a power unit for the pump and full circulation
spray bars adjustable laterally and vertically.
Travelling or stationary mixing plants or other equipment of proven performance may be used by
the contractor in lieu of the specified equipment if approved.
Rollers shall be of self-propelled steel wheel tandem or 3-wheel rollers weighing not less than
eight-tons each. Pneumatic-tired rollers shall have a total compact width of not less than 60
inches and a gross weight adjustable within the range of 200 to 350 pounds per inch of
compaction width. The operating weight shall be as directed. Tire pressure or contract pressure
may be specified for pneumatic-tired rollers.
607B.06 - PREPARATION OF BASE
Before materials for road mixing are spread, the surface on which the road mix is to be placed
shall be conditioned as specified in Section 609.12, Conditioning of Existing Surface and primed
and tacked, where required, in accordance with Sections 608C, Prime Coat and 608B, Tack Coat,
respectively.
607B.07 - PLACING AGGREGATES
Aggregates shall be uniformly spread on the road by the use of spreader boxes or other approved
mechanical spreading devices. When two or more sizes of aggregates are used, each size of
aggregate shall be placed in the proper amount to provide for surfacing of the required width and
thickness. Each size of aggregate shall be windrowed to uniform section and left undisturbed
until measuring and sampling are completed, after which they shall be mixed until they are
uniformly blended and then spread over the road surface.
If the surface moisture of the aggregate is more than two percent of the dry weight of the
aggregate, except when the bituminous material is emulsified asphalt, the aggregate shall be
turned by blades or disc harrows or otherwise aerated until the moisture content is reduced to
two percent or less.
The aggregate shall then be spread smoothly and uniformly over half the road or other
convenient width of the surface ready for the application of bituminous material, except that
when a traveling mixing plant is used, the aggregate shall be formed into a uniform crosssection.
In lieu of aerating and drying the aggregate, the contractor may use an approved additive. The
additive shall permit suitable coating of the wet aggregate and shall prevent the bituminous 
Sect 607B page 3 of 4
coating from stripping in the presence of water.
607B.08 - APPLICATION OF BITUMINOUS MATERIAL
The bituminous material shall be uniformly distributed in successive applications, in such
amounts and at such intervals as directed. The mixing equipment shall follow immediately
behind the distributor after each application of bituminous material to partially mix the aggregate
and the bituminous material. Application temperatures shall be in accordance with Section
608B.06, Application Temperatures.
607B.09 - MIXING
After the last application of bituminous material and partial mixing, the entire mass of
bituminous material and aggregate shall be windrowed on the road surface and then mixed, by
blading the mixture from side to side of the road or by manipulations producing equivalent
results, until all aggregate particles are coated with bituminous material and the whole mass has
a uniform color and the mixture is free from rich or lean spots, balls or uncoated particles.
During the mixing operations, care shall be taken to avoid cutting into the underlying course or
contaminating the mixture with the earth or other extraneous matter. The mixing process shall
be confined to part of the width or area of the road when required to allow traffic to pass.
Should the mixture show an excess, deficiency or uneven distribution of bituminous material, the
condition shall be corrected by the addition of aggregate or bituminous material as required and
remixing. If the mixture contains excessive amounts of moisture or volatile matter, it shall be
bladed, aerated or otherwise manipulated until the moisture and volatile contents are satisfactory.
 The spreading of the mix shall not be done when the surface to be covered is in an
unsatisfactory condition.
At the end of the day's work or when the work is interrupted by weather conditions or otherwise,
all loose material shall be bladed into a windrow whether or not mixing is completed and shall
be retained in a windrow until operations are resumed.
When the mixing operations have been satisfactorily completed, the mixture shall be formed into
a windrow of uniform cross-section.
If the contractor requests and is authorized to use, travelling or stationary mixing plants in lieu of
the specified equipment, the same requirements regarding residual moisture and evaporation of
volatiles given above shall apply.
SECTION 607B.10 - SPREADING, COMPACTING AND FINISHING
The material shall be spread by a self-propelled, pneumatic-tired blade grader or mechanical
spreader of approved type. Care shall be taken to avoid cutting into the underlying base when
the material is spread from the windrow. 
Sect 607B page 4 of 4
After the material is spread, the surface shall be rolled. Rolling shall be parallel to the road
centerline and shall commence at the outer edges of the road, overlapping the shoulders and
progress toward the center, overlapping on successive passes by at least one-half the width of the
roller, except that on super-elevated curves rolling shall progress from the lower to the upper
edge. Each pass shall terminate at least three feet (3') in advance or to the rear of the end of the
preceding pass. Curing the compaction, the surface shall be dragged or bladed as necessary to
fill ruts and to remove incipient corrugations or other irregularities. Rolling shall continue until
the surfacing is of uniform texture and satisfactory compaction has been obtained. Initial rolling
shall be performed with a pneumatic-tired roller, and final rolling shall be performed with a
three-wheel or tandem-type steel wheel roller. Rolling shall be discontinued whenever it begins
to produce excessive pulverizing of the aggregate or displacement of the mixture.
Where the compacted thickness of the road mix surface is to be more than two inches (2"), the
mixture shall be spread from the windrow and compacted in two layers, the first layer to be
bladed and rolled before the second layer is spread.
While the surface is being compacted and finished, the contractor shall trim the edges neatly to
line.
SECTION 607B.11 - SURFACE REQUIREMENTS
The surface will be tested by the engineer using a ten-foot straightedge at selected locations.
The variation of the surface shall at no point exceed ¼ inch. All humps or depressions
exceeding the specified tolerance shall be corrected by removing defective work and replacing it
with new material as specified.

The plant shall have a feeder mounted under each compartment bin. Each
compartment bin shall have an accurately controlled, individual gate to
form an orifice for volummetrically measuring the material drawn from
each compartment. The feeding orifice shall be rectangular with one
dimension adjustable by positive mechanical means and secured against
inadvertent movement.
Indicators shall be provided for each gate to show the respective opening
in inches.
2. Weight Calibration of Aggregate Feed - The plant shall include a means
for calibration of gate openings by weighing test samples. Provision shall
be made so that materials fed out of individual orifices may be bypassed to
individual test boxes. The plant shall be equipped to conveniently handle
individual test samples weighing not less than 200 pounds, and accurate
scales shall be provided by the Contractor to weigh such test samples.
3. Synchronization of Aggregate Feed and Bituminous Material Feed -
Satisfactory means shall be provided to afford positive interlocking control
between the flow of aggregate from the bins and the flow of bituminous
material from the meter or other proportioning device. This control shall
be accomplished by interlocking mechanical means or by any other
positive, satisfactory method.
4. Mixing - The plant shall include a continuous mixer of an approved twin
pugmill type, adequately heated and capable of producing a uniform
mixture within the job-mix tolerances. 
Sect 609 page 9 of 14
It shall be equipped with a discharge hopper with dump gates which will
permit rapid and complete discharge of the mixture. The paddles shall be
adjustable for angular position on the shafts and reversible to retard the
flow of the mix. The mixer shall have a manufacturer's plate giving the net
volummetric contents of the mixer at the several heights inscribed on a
permanent gauge. Charts shall be provided showing the rate of feed of
aggregate per minute for the aggregate being used.
The clearance of blades from all fixed and moving parts shall not exceed
one inch (1").
SECTION 609.14 HAULING EQUIPMENT
Trucks used for hauling bituminous mixtures shall have tight, clean, smooth, metal beds which
have been thinly coated with a minimum amount of paraffin oil or other approved material to
prevent the mixture from adhering to the beds. This material shall not be used in amounts which
will contaminate the mixture. When required, each truck shall have a cover of canvas or other
suitable material of such size as to protect the mixture from the weather. When necessary, so
that the mixture will be delivered on the road at the specified temperature, truck beds shall be
insulated and covers shall be securely fastened.
Railroad cars used for transportation of cold-laid bituminous mixtures shall be in good condition
and without pockets. All projecting spikes, nails, foreign material, and other obstructions likely
to interfere with efficient unloading shall be removed from the cars. The bottoms of the cars
shall be covered with a thin layer of clean sand or screening, and the top of the load shall be
protected from contamination by moisture or foreign materials, and from the loss of volatile
material.
SECTION 609.15 BITUMINOUS PAVERS
Bituminous pavers shall be self-contained, power-propelled units, provided with an activated
screed or strike-off assembly, heated if necessary, and capable of spreading and finishing courses
of bituminous plant mix material in lane widths applicable to the specified typical section and
thicknesses shown on the plans. Pavers used for shoulders and similar construction shall be
capable of spreading and finishing courses of bituminous plant mix material in widths shown on
the plans.
The paver shall be equipped with a receiving hopper having sufficient capacity for a uniform
spreading operation. The hopper shall be equipped with a distribution system to place the
mixture uniformly in front of the screed.
The screed or strike-off assembly shall effectively produce a finished surface of the required
evenness and texture without tearing, shoving, or gouging the mixture. 
Sect 609 page 10 of 14
Pavers shall be equipped with a paver control system which will automatically control the laying
of the mixture to specified transverse slope and established longitudinal grade. The paver
control system shall be automatically actuated from an independent line and grade control
reference and through a system of mechanical sensors and sensor-directed devices which shall
maintain the paver screed at the proper transverse slope and at proper height to establish the top
surface of the finally compacted mixture at specified slope and grade. In case of failure of the
control system, the paver shall be operated by mechanical control only until the material under
production at the time of breakdown is laid.
The paver shall be capable of being operated, when laying mixtures, at forward speeds consistent
with satisfactory laying of the mixture.
All rollers shall be in good condition, capable of reversing without backlash, and shall be
operated at speeds slow enough to avoid displacement of the bituminous mixture. The number
and weight of rollers shall be sufficient to compact the mixture to the required density while it is
still in a workable condition. The use of equipment which results in excessive crushing of the
aggregate will not be permitted.
SECTION 609.17 CONDITIONING OF EXISTING SURFACE
When the surface of the existing pavement or old base is irregular, it shall be brought to uniform
grade and cross section as directed.
When specified in the contracts, all longitudinal and transverse joints and all cracks shall be
sealed by the application of an approved joint sealing compound before the mixture is spread
upon a pavement surface. All excessive bituminous material shall be removed from joints and
cracks prior to placement of mixture.
SECTION 609.18 PREPARATION OF BITUMINOUS MATERIAL
The bituminous material shall be heated to the specified temperature in a manner that will avoid
local overheating and provide a continuous supply of the bituminous material to the mixer at a
uniform temperature at all times. Charts showing specified temperature range for each source of
supply are available from the Headquarters Laboratory of the Wyoming Highway Department.
SECTION 609.19 PREPARATION OF AGGREGATE
The aggregates for the mixture shall be dried and heated to the required temperature. Flames
used for drying and heating shall be properly adjusted to avoid damage to the aggregate or
coating the aggregate with soot, oil, or other contaminates.
The aggregates, immediately after heating and drying, shall be screened into two or more
fractions and conveyed into separate compartments ready for batching and mixing with 
Sect 609 page 11 of 14
bituminous material. Screening shall be at such rate and in such manner that the coarse
aggregate bin or bins shall contain less than ten percent (10%) of minus No. 4 material and the
fine bin shall contain less than ten percent (10%) of plus No. 4 material.
SECTION 609.20 MIXING
The dried aggregate shall be combined in the mixer in the amount of each fraction of aggregates
required to meet the job-mix formula. The bituminous material shall be measured or gauged and
introduced into the mixer in the amount specified by the job-mix formula.
After the required amounts of aggregate and bituminous material have been introduced into the
mixer, unless otherwise specified, the materials shall be mixed until a complete and uniform
coating of the particles and a thorough distribution of the bituminous material throughout the
aggregate is secured.
For hot mix bituminous pavement, the mixture shall be produced at the lowest possible
temperature that will produce a workable mix within the application temperatures specified
under Section 608A.06, APPLICATION TEMPERATURES. The bituminous material and
aggregate shall be introduced into the mixer within the specified temperature range and shall be
within 25° F of each other.
SECTION 609.21 SPREADING AND FINISHING
The mixture shall be laid upon an approved surface, spread, and struck off to the grade and
elevation established. Bituminous pavers shall be used to distribute the mixture either over the
entire width or over such partial width as may be practicable.
When the total compacted thickness of the mat is to be in excess of two inches (2"), it shall be
placed in two or more lifts. The compacted thickness of any one lift in multiple-life construction
shall not exceed two inches (2").
Except on tapers, narrow median areas, shoulders, and other such areas of irregular shape,
limited length or restrictive width, or such other areas as directed, the paver screed shall be
controlled by the automatic screed control described under Section 609.15, BITUMINOUS
PAVERS.
The Engineer will perform such engineering as may be required to establish controls for the
work and will set references for line and grade controls at reasonable intervals along the work.
The Contractor shall furnish, place, and maintain such materials, devices, and equipment as may
be required to provide specified independent line and grade control references and other controls
which may be required for proper execution of the work.
Line and grade control for use with automatic paver control systems shall be an independent
control reference consisting of: 
Sect 609 page 12 of 14
(1) A tightly stretched wire of string line offset and paralleling true line for
pavement edge and established grade for pavement surface;
(2) A floating beam of not less than 20 feet (20') in length attached to the
paver and riding on previously placed base or pavement material. The
beam shall be equipped with a floating string or other device that will
actuate the automatic screed control in reference to the base on which it is
riding. Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, the first ribbon of the
first course of pavement material shall be controlled by the independent
control wire. Subsequent ribbons may be controlled by the beam reference
system.
The longitudinal joint in one layer shall offset that in the layer immediately below, by at least six
inches (6").
Defects caused by trucks bumping into the laydown machine or by unnecessary stopping due to a
lack of coordination between mixing, hauling, and laydown shall be removed and replaced in
accordance with Section 609.24 SURFACE TOLERANCE.
On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading and
finishing equipment impracticable, the mixture shall be spread, raked, and luted by hand tools.
For such areas the mixture shall be dumped, spread, and screened to give the required compacted
thickness.
Plant mix surfacing ribbons shall be brought up approximately even at the end of each shift on
those projects being constructed under traffic.
SECTION 609.22 COMPACTION
Immediately after the bituminous mixture has been spread and struck off and the surface
irregularities adjusted, it shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted by rolling. Rolling shall
be continued while the mixture is in a workable condition until all roller marks are eliminated
and, unless otherwise designated on the plans, until a minimum of 95 percent (95%) of the
maximum density as established by Marshall test results as determined by an approved
laboratory has been obtained. Samples will be taken in accordance with AASHTO T-230, or
density will be determined by the use of properly calibrated Nuclear Density Gauge.
The number, weight, and type of rollers furnished shall be sufficient to obtain the required
compaction without undue displacement, cracking, or shoving. Pneumatic tires shall be inflated
to obtain the contact area pressures designated by the Engineer.
Unless otherwise directed, rolling shall begin at the sides and proceed longitudinally parallel to
the road centerline, each trip overlapping one-half the roller width. Rollers shall move at a slow, 
Sect 609 page 13 of 14
uniform speed with the drive wheels or rolls nearest the paver except on steep grades.
When the pavement is placed by machines in echelon or abutted against a previously placed
lane, the longitudinal joint shall be rolled first, followed by the regular rolling procedure. On
super-elevated curves, the rolling shall begin at the low side and progress to the high side by
overlapping of longitudinal trips parallel to the centerline.
Any displacement occurring as a result of the reversing of the direction of a roller, or from other
causes, shall be corrected at once by the use of rakes and addition of fresh mixture when
required. Care should be exercised in rolling not to displace the line and grade of the edges of
the bituminous mixture.
To prevent adhesion of the mixture to the rollers, the wheels shall be kept properly moistened
with water or water mixed with very small quantities of detergent or other approved material.
Excess liquid will not be permitted.
Along forms, curbs, headers, walls, and other places not accessible to the rollers, the mixture
shall be thoroughly compacted with hot hand tampers, smoothing irons, or mechanical tampers.
On depressed areas, a trench roller may be used, or cleated compression strips may be used
under the roller to transmit compression to the depressed area.
Any mixture that becomes loose and broken, mixed with dirt, or is in any way defective shall be
removed and replaced with fresh hot mixture, which shall be compacted to conform with the
surrounding area. Any area showing an excess or deficiency of bituminous material shall be
removed and replaced.
SECTION 609.23 JOINTS
Placing of the bituminous paving shall be as continuous as possible. Rollers shall not pass over
the unprotected end of a freshly laid mixture unless authorized by the engineer. Transverse
joints shall be formed by cutting back on the previous run to expose the full depth of the course.
When directed by the engineer, a brush coat of bituminous material shall be used on contact
surfaces of transverse joints just before additional mixture is placed against the previously rolled
material.
The surface will be tested by the engineer using a 10-foot straightedge at selected locations. The
variation of the surface from the testing edge of the straightedge between any two contacts with
the surface shall at no point exceed 3/16-inch. All humps or depressions exceeding the specified
tolerance shall be corrected by removing defective work and replacing it with new material, or as
directed.

(14) and shall have a warped transition of five (5) feet on each side, as shown on City of Lander
Standard Drawing No. 504-02. The minimum thickness for alley approaches and the adjacent
sidewalk section shall be six (6) inches. A one (1) inch lip for the blind shall be provided at the
gutter line. 
Sect 801 page 8 of 10
SECTION 801.10 - URBAN STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
A. GENERAL - All streets shall be designed to provide continuous surface drainage directed
to storm drain inlets and drainage courses. Grades shall permit flow without ponding. Six
(6) foot concrete valley gutters shall normally be installed across those streets at
intersections carrying traffic which must stop. Installation of valley gutters between
intersections or across streets carrying through traffic at intersections shall be avoided in
all possible cases. A check shall be made to be sure of continuity drainage design
between the proposed construction and existing or future construction. In no case shall
surface drainage be permitted to be disposed of overland except by approved storm
drainage facilities.
B. INITIAL STORM PROVISIONS - The initial storm drainage system is necessary to
reduce street maintenance costs, to provide protection against regularly recurring damage
from storm runoff, to help create an orderly urban system and to provide convenience to
the urban residents. The initial drainage system cannot economically carry major runoffs,
though the major drainage system can provide for the initial runoff. A well planned initial
drainage system can reduce or eliminate the need for storm sewer systems.
Storm sewer systems consisting of underground pipes are a part of initial storm drainage
systems.
C. MAJOR STORM PROVISIONS - In addition to providing the storm drainage facilities
for the initial storm runoff from an expected frequency of occurrence of once in five (5)
years, provisions shall be made to obviate major property damage and loss of life for the
storm runoff expected to occur once each 100 years. Such provisions are known as the
major drainage system.
D. MAJOR DRAINAGE CHANNELS - Open channels for transportation of major storm
runoff are desirable in urban areas and use of such channels is encouraged.
Open channel planning and design objectives are best met by using natural, or naturaltype channels, which characteristically have slow velocities and a large width to depth
ratio.
Natural water courses, perhaps wet only during and after large rainstorms, must not be
filled or straightened significantly, such actions tend to reduce storage and increase the
velocity to the detriment of those downstream as well as those adjacent to the channel
work. Effort must be made to reduce flood peaks and control erosion so that the natural
channel regime is preserved as much as possible.
E. DESIGN STORM FREQUENCIES - Storm drainage planning and design shall fully
recognize the need for considering two separate and distinct storm drainage systems: that 
Sect 801 page 9 of 10
is, the initial drainage system and the major drainage system. Design storm frequencies
shall be:

5 100 0.80" 1.58"
F. RUNOFF COMPUTATION - The determination of storm runoff magnitude shall be by
the rational formula.
1. Areas under 200 Acres - The Rational formula shall be the method used to
compute the amount of storm runoff for basins less than 200 acres in size and for
the sizing of storm sewer systems.
2. Areas over 200 Acres - A unit Hydrograph Procedure shall be used for computing
the amount of storm runoff for drainage areas over 200 acres in size. However,
the sub-basins making up the total area, when less than 200 acres individually,
may be studied using the Rational Formula.
The unit Hydrograph procedure provides a means for adequately evaluating different
times of concentration from various sub-basins at a point of concentration for sizing of
channels, trunk lines and outfalls.
G. USE OF STREETS - Streets are significant and important in urban drainage and full use
shall be made of streets for storm runoff up to reasonable limits, and recognizing that the
primary purpose of streets is for traffic. Reasonable limits of the use of streets for
transportation of storm runoff shall be governed by the design criteria listed below. 
Sect 801 page 10 of 10
ALLOWABLE USE OF STREETS FOR INITIAL STORM RUNOFF IN TERMS OF
PAVEMENT ENCROACHMENT
Street Classification Maximum Encroachment
Local No curb overtopping. Flow may spread to
crown of street.
Collector No curb overtopping. Flow spread must
leave at least one lane free of water.
Arterial No curb overtopping. Flow spread must
leave at least one lane free of water in each
direction.
When the above encroachment is indicated, the storm sewer system shall be commenced,
designed on the basis of the initial storm. Development of the major drainage system is
encouraged which can often drain off the initial runoff from the streets, thus making the
point at which the storm sewer system shall commence further downstream.
H. IRRIGATION DITCHES - Irrigation ditches shall not be used as outfall points for initial
or major drainage systems, unless such use is shown to be without unreasonable hazard
substantiated by adequate hydraulic engineering analysis.
1. Use of Ditches - Irrigation ditches through urban areas are usually laid out on flat
slopes and with limited carrying capacity. It is obvious, based on experience and
hydraulic calculations, that irrigation ditches cannot, as a general rule, be used as
an outfall point for the initial storm drainage system because of physical
limitations. Exceptions to the rule are when the capacity of the irrigation ditch is
adequate to carry the normal ditch flow plus the initial storm runoff with adequate
freeboard to obviate creating a hazard to those below the ditch.
2. Ditch Perpetuation - Irrigation ditches are sometimes abandoned in urban areas
after the agricultural land is no longer farmed. Provisions must be made for ditch
perpetuation prior to its being chosen and used as an outfall for urban drainage.
SECTION 801.11 - FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS - Flexible pavement shall consist of full depth
asphaltic concrete or a combination of asphaltic concrete and granular base course. Pavement
thickness shall be determined by use of underlying soil and traffic analysis. This analysis shall
be done by a recognized soils testing laboratory and method under the direction of Professional
Engineers. Samples for determination shall be made at the proposed subgrade elevation. Traffic
volummes and truck loadings shall be determined by the City engineer and the design method
shall be the asphalt institute thickness design. If another method of thickness design is used, the 
Sect 801 page 11 of 10
engineer must show that the selection design thickness procedure does not result in a lesser
pavement section. Test results shall be interpreted in such a manner as to insure adequate
pavement thickness in all cases. Where testing indicates the minimum thickness may be used,
these values are as follows. Full depth thickness shall be taken as six (6) inches minimum for
collector and five (5) inches minimum for local streets. Minimum thickness of base and
asphaltic pavement combinations shall be two and one half (2 1/2) and two (2) inches asphaltic
pavements and eight (8) and six (6) inches granular base for collector and local streets
respectively. Industrial gravel surfaced streets shall have a minimum of twelve (12) inches of
gravel.
The combination of paving, base and subexcavated subgrade shall be designed for a stable street
grade. Construction fabrics may be used in this design to substitute for a portion of any
otherwise subexcavated and backfilled subgrade.

SECTION 803.02 - HYDRAULIC DESIGN - Sewers 10 inches in diameter and smaller shall
carry the design flow at a maximum flow depth of three quarters (75%) of the pipe diameter.
Trunk sewers 12 inches in diameter and larger may be designed to flow full at the design flow
rate. The minimum velocity at the design flow rate shall be 2.0 feet per second. Where actual
flow will be much below normal for several years the minimum velocity shall be achieved by
suitable grades at the partial design flow rate. Care shall be taken to design invert elevations at
manholes in such a manner that the energy gradient is consistently falling in the direction of
flow. Maximum allowable velocity shall not exceed 10 ft./sec. at three-quarters full.
SECTION 803.03 - DESIGN DETAILS - Sanitary sewer mains shall ordinarily be 8 inch
diameter or larger. Service connection shall be 4 inch diameter or larger. The following
minimum grades shall apply unless requirements of Paragraph 2 govern. 
Sect 803 page 2 of 3
SEWER DIAMETER MINIMUM GRADE (PERCENT)

6 inch 0.64
8 inch 0.40
10 inch 0.28
12 inch 0.22
15 inch or larger Min. Velocity of 2 tf./sec.
Manholes shall be provided at every change in direction, grade or connection with other sewer
mains; maximum spacing shall be 400 feet for lines 15 inches or smaller, or 500 feet for lines 18
inches and larger. Maximum change of direction in manholes for lines 18 inches and larger
shall be 45 degrees. Sewer lines shall be straight and not curved between manholes, both in line
and grade. Cleanouts may be provided instead of a manhole at dead-ends if the total length
above the last manhole is less than 100 feet and a maximum of three residential connections are
to be made. Drop manholes shall be designed according to the drawing in The City of Lander
Standard Drawing 401-01.
In general, sewer mains shall have a minimum of 8 feet of cover between top of pipe and
finished ground surface. Where this will provide less than 9 feet of elevation difference between
the finished lot grade at building line and the top of the sewer main, it shall be indicated on the
plans that the lot is served by a "shallow sewer" and appropriate elevation information shall be
given.
Sewer mains shall be extended to a point at least 10 feet uphill from the lowest lot corner
adjacent to the sewer main of the uppermost lot to be served and terminate in a cleanout or
manhole. Service connections shall not be made at manholes but shall be provided above or
below the manhole as required, unless approved by the City Engineer. Manholes shall be
stubbed out with suitable size pipe and plugged wherever future lateral extension of the sewer is
anticipated.
SECTION 803.04 - CONSTRUCTION DETAILS - All sanitary sewer mains shall be bedded
in well-graded sand or sand gravel mixtures having a maximum size of 1 1/2 inches. Poorly
graded gravel shall have a maximum size of 3/4" may be used at the direction of the Engineer.
Migration of fines, from the backfill into the poorly graded gravel had been a problem in the
past, and it is desirable to minimize their use of installed without a filter. Bedding shall extend
from three (3) inches below the pipe to twelve (12) inches above the pipe. The bedding material
shall be distributed by hand in maximum layers of six (6) inches and thoroughly compacted by
tamping. When wet, unstable trench bottoms exist, a minimum of 6" additional bedding shall be 
Sect 803 page 3 of 3
installed below the normal three (3) inches of bedding.
Where sewer pipe has less than four feet of cover, provision shall be made to protect the pipe
from impact loading. Where design velocities exceed 10 feet per second, special provisions shall
be made to protect against pipe displacement by erosion and shock.
SECTION 803.05 - SERVICE CONNECTIONS - Wyes shall be provided in the sewer main
for service connections at each lot or building site and shall be shown on the plans. These
fittings shall ordinarily be located 10' from lower side of lot and a minimum of ten (10) feet on
the horizontal plane from the water service line. Fittings shall be angled upwards so that the
upper invert of one-eighth bend connected to the fitting will have an elevation equal to or higher
than the inside crown of the sewer main. Riser connections shall be installed where the elevation
of the top of the fitting is more than 12 feet below finished ground. Riser connection shall
ordinarily reach to a grade 10 feet below finished ground surface. See City of Lander Standards
and Specifications for Sanitary Sewer Services for details on service stub-in and house service
connections.
