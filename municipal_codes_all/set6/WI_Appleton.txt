PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the
City of Appleton, Wisconsin.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as supplemented
through January 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Common Council. The source of
each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of
such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the
Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any
section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various
sections within each chapter have been catch lined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the
dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within
the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbers 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1.
Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even
whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be number 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the
same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as
Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when
including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case
of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions,
may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be
assigned to the new article or division.
Indices
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous
cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in
which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing
of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory
legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These
new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of
inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the
publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have
the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the
publisher that all such amendments to inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in
addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
ADOPTING ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE NO. 31-92
An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of Appleton,
Wisconsin; Providing to the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein;
Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of

The Common Council of the City of Appleton do ordain as follows:
Section 1. The Code entitled “Municipal Code of the City of Appleton”
published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of Chapters 1 through 22, each
inclusive, is adopted.
Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature on or before
December 19, 1991, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in
force by reference therein, are repealed.
Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to
revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance
that is repealed by this ordinance.
Section 4. Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is
prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in such
Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is
declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise provided in this Code,
the violation of any such provision of this Code or ordinance shall be punished as
follows:
1. First offense. Any person who shall violate any provision of this Code
subject to a penalty shall, upon the first conviction thereof, forfeit not less
than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00)
together with the costs of prosecution, and in default of payment of such
forfeiture and costs of prosecution shall be imprisoned in the county jail.
2. Second and subsequent offenses. Any person found guilty of violating any
provision of this Code who shall previously have been convicted of a
violation of the same provision shall upon conviction thereof forfeit not less
than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
each such offense, together with the costs of prosecution, and in default of
payment of such forfeiture and costs shall be imprisoned in the county jail.
Whenever any person fails to pay any forfeiture and costs of prosecution
upon the order of the court for violation of any ordinance of the city, the
court may, in lieu of ordering imprisonment of the defendant, or after the
defendant had been released from custody, issue an execution against the
property of the defendant for the forfeiture and costs. Each violation and
each day a violation continues or occurs shall constitute a separate offense.
Nothing in this Code shall preclude the city from maintaining any
appropriate action to prevent or remove a violation of this Code. In case the
amendment by the common council of any section of this Code for which a
penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in this section shall
apply to the section as amended. In case such amendment contains
provisions for which a specified penalty other than the general penalty is
provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so specified shall
be held to relate to the amended section unless such penalty is specifically
repealed therein.
In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies
such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or
permits.
Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to
indicate the intention of the Common Council to make the same a part of the Code
shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code
includes the additions and amendments.
Section 6. Ordinances adopted after December 19, 1991, that amend or refer to
ordinances that have been codified in this Code, shall be construed as if they amend
or refer to like provisions of the Code.
Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective upon passage and publication.
Passed and adopted by the Common Council this 18th day of March, 1992.

(Code 1965, §25.06)
Sec. 1-11. Effect of amendments to code.
(a) Any and all additions and amendments to this code,
when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the
Common Council to make the addition or amendment a part
hereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated in this code so
that reference to the code shall be understood and intended
to include such additions and amendments.
(b) All ordinances passed subsequent to this code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this code may be
numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this
code and printed for inclusion herein. When subsequent
ordinances repeal any chapter, article, division, section or
subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed portions
may be excluded from the code by omission from printed
pages.
(c) Amendments to any of the provisions of this code
may be made by amending such provisions by specific
reference to the section number of this code in substantially
the following language: “That Section _____ of the
Municipal Code of the City of Appleton, is hereby amended
to read as follows . . .” The new provisions shall then be set
out in full as desired.
(d) If a new section not heretofore existing in the code is
to be added, the following language may be used: “That
the Municipal Code of the City of Appleton is hereby
amended by adding a section to be numbered ____, which
section reads as follows . . .” The new section may then be
set out in full as desired.
(e) All sections, divisions, articles, chapters or
provisions desired to be repealed must be specifically
repealed by section, division, article or chapter number, as
the case may be.
Sec. 1-12. Supplementation of code.
(a) By contract or by City personnel, supplements to this
code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or
directed by the Common Council. A supplement to the
code shall include all substantive permanent and general
parts of ordinances passed by the Common Council or
adopted by initiative and referendum during the period
covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in
the code, and shall also include all amendments to the
charter during the period. The pages of a supplement shall
be so numbered that they will fit property into the code and
will, where necessary, replace pages which have become
obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so
prepared that, when they have been inserted, the code will
be current through the date of the adoption of the latest
ordinance included in the supplement.
(b) In preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier,
meaning the person, agency, or organization authorized to
prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive
changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in
the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to
embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifer
may:
(1) Organize the ordinance material into
appropriate subdivisions;
(2) Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and
titles for sections and other subdivisions of the
code printed in the supplement, and make
changes in catchlines, headings and titles;
(3) Assign appropriate numbers to sections and
other subdivisions to be inserted in the code
and, where necessary to accommodate new
material, change existing section or other
subdivision numbers;
(4) Change the words “this ordinance” or words of
the same meaning to “this chapter”, “this
article”, “this division”, etc., as the case may
be, or to “sections ______ through ______”.
The inserted section numbers will indicate the
sections of the code which embody the
substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code; and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary
to preserve the original meaning of the
ordinance section inserted into the code; but in
no case shall the codifier make any change in
the meaning or effect of ordnance material
included in the supplement or already embodied
in the code.

arising out of the subject matter of such chapter.
(Code 1965, §25.03(1))
Sec. 1-15. Severability of parts of code.
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Common
Council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses
and phrases of this code are severable, and if any phrase,
clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this code shall be
declared unconstitutional, invalid, or unenforceable, such
unconstitutionality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not
affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences,
paragraphs and sections of this code.
(Code 1965, §25.03(2))
Sec. 1-16. General penalty.
(a) Whenever in this code or in any ordinance of the
City any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be
unlawful or an offense, or whenever in such code or
ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to
do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific
penalty is otherwise provided in this code, the violation of
any such provision of this code or ordinance shall be
punished as follows:
(1) First offense. Any person who shall violate
any provision of this code subject to a penalty
shall, upon the first conviction thereof, forfeit
not less than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than
two hundred dollars ($200.00) together with the
costs of prosecution, and in default of payment
of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution shall
be imprisoned in the county jail.
(2) Second and subsequent offenses. Any person
found guilty of violating any provision of this
code who shall previously have been convicted
of a violation of the same provision shall upon
conviction thereof forfeit not less than ten
dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each such offense,
together with the costs of prosecution, and in
default of payment of such forfeiture and costs
shall be imprisoned in the county jail.
(b) Whenever any person fails to pay any forfeiture and
costs of prosecution upon the order of the court for
violation of any ordinance of the City, the court may, in lieu
of ordering imprisonment of the defendant, or after the
defendant has been released from custody, issue an
execution against the property of the defendant for the
forfeiture and costs.
(c) Each violation and each day a violation continues or
occurs shall constitute a separate offense. Nothing in this
code shall preclude the City from maintaining any
appropriate action to prevent or remove a violation of this
code.
(d) In case of the amendment by the Common Council
of any section of this code for which a penalty is not
provided, the general penalty as provided in subsection (a)
of this section shall apply to the section as amended. In
case such amendment contains provisions for which a
specified penalty other than the general penalty is provided
in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so
specified shall be held to relate to the amended section
unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.

alleged violator that;
a. A cash deposit based on the schedule
established by §1-18 may be made which
shall be delivered or mailed to the Director
of Finance or Clerk of Court prior to the
time of the scheduled court appearance;
b. If a deposit is made, no appearance in court
is necessary unless he is subsequently
summoned;
c. If a cash deposit is made and the alleged
violator does not appear in court, he will be
deemed to have entered a plea of no
contest, and submitted to a forfeiture not to
exceed the amount of the deposit, or will
be summoned into court if the court does
not accept the plea of no contest;
d. If no cash deposit is made and the alleged
violator does not appear in court at the
time specified, the court may issue a
summons or a warrant for the defendant’s
arrest, or consider the nonappearance to be
plea of no contest and enter judgment or an
action may be commenced to collect the
forfeiture;
e. If the court finds that the violation involves
an ordinance that prohibits conduct that is
the same or similar to conduct prohibited
by state statute punishable by fine or
imprisonment or both, and that the
violation resulted in damage to the
property of or physical injury to a person
other than the alleged violator, the court
may summon the alleged violator into court
to determine if restitution shall be ordered.
(8) A direction that if the alleged violator elects to
make a cash deposit, the statement which
accompanies the citation shall be signed to
indicate that the statement required under

§66.0113(3) relating to violator’s options and procedure on
default is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference.
(e) Citation procedure not exclusive.
(1) Adoption of the citation method of enforcement
of ordinances does not preclude the Council
from adopting any other ordinance or providing
for the enforcement of any other law or
ordinance relating to the same or other matter.
(2) The issuance of citation under this section shall
not preclude the City or any authorized officer
from proceeding under any other ordinance or
law or by any other enforcement method to
enforce any ordinance, regulation or order.

dangerous animal, the Police Department
may issue an order declaring an animal to be
a prohibited dangerous animal. Whenever an
owner or caretaker wishes to contest an
order, he or she shall, within seventy-two
(72) hours after receipt of the order, deliver
to the Health Officer a written objection to
the order stating specific reasons for
contesting the order. Upon receipt of the
written objection, the matter shall be placed
on the agenda for the Board of Health to be
reviewed at the next regular meeting. The
Board of Health shall act as a quasi-judicial
body allowing the animal’s owner or
caretaker an opportunity to present evidence
as to why the animal should not be declared a
prohibited dangerous animal.
(3) Pending the outcome of the hearing, the
animal may be confined subject to Sec.
173.21, Wis. Stats., or held at a location
outside the limits of the City.
(4) After the hearing, the owner or caretaker
shall be notified in writing of the Board’s
determination. If a determination is made
that the animal is a prohibited dangerous
animal, the owner or caretaker shall comply
with subsection (a) within five (5) days after
the date of the determination. If the owner or
caretaker further contests the determination,
he or she may, within five (5) days of

receiving the panel’s decision, seek review of
the decision by the Circuit Court.
(c) Destruction. Any dog that has caused bodily
harm to a person, persons or a domestic animal on two (2)
separate occasions off the owner’s premises, without
reasonable cause, may be destroyed as a result of judgment
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, as specified
under sec. 174.02(3), Wis. Stats. The City Attorney may
petition an appropriate court to obtain a court order to
destroy such a dog.
(d) Enforcement. The Health Department and Police
Department may make whatever inquiry is deemed
necessary to ensure compliance with this section.
(e) Waiver. The Health Officer may waive the
provisions of this section for a law enforcement or military
animal upon presentation by the animal’s owner or handler
of a satisfactory arrangement for safe keeping of the
animal.

Supp. #89
ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 4-1. Maintenance of buildings.
All buildings and structures and all parts thereof, both
existing and new, shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary
condition. All service equipment, means of egress, devices
and safeguards which are required by this chapter in a
building or which were required by a previous statute in a
building when erected, altered or repaired shall be maintained
in good working order.
(Code 1965, §14.10)
Sec. 4-2. Alterations and repairs.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, existing
buildings, when altered or repaired as specified in this
chapter, shall be made to conform to the full requirements of
this chapter for new buildings.
(Code 1965, §14.11)
Sec. 4-3. Building numbering.
(a) Each building erected in the city shall be assigned a
building number by the Inspections Division in accordance
with the building number map which is on file in the office of
the Department of Public Works. Only those numbers
assigned as provided in this section shall be used on each
building. Each owner must fasten or paint a permanent, light
reflecting, legible building number of a conspicuous color
contrasting to the building background color, which shall be
no less than four (4) inches in height on all buildings on the
front face of the building within four (4) feet of the principal
entrance door abutting the street. If this location is deemed
impractical by the Inspections Division or Fire Department,
the building numbers on residential properties may be placed
on the garage on the side closest to the principle entrance or a
location approved by the Inspections Division and the Fire
Department. The address number shall be readily visible
from the street and shall not be obstructed by any structural
element, plant, tree, shrub or similar obstruction. Address
numbers may not be in a script typeface. If the principal
entrance to a structure is not on the assigned address street
then the property owner must have the above-mentioned
address numbers posted at more than one entrance or location
on that building.
(b) Mobile home numbers will be placed in a uniform
area on each unit within the mobile home park. The number
shall be placed on or as close as possible to the entrance door
and shall be visible from the public right-of-way readily
abutting the property.
(c) If the building is set back forty (40) feet or more
from the front property line, the property owner must place
and maintain the required numbers on a mailbox or a signpost
located at or near the front property line.
(d) Commercial buildings situated in a manner that may
create confusion for emergency personnel responding to the
rear side of such building shall also post their business
address on their back doors. This section shall apply to
commercial buildings including, but not limited to, multiple
tenant strip malls, buildings serviced with alleyways such as
downtown areas and single buildings with multiple tenants
with individual rear doors for each tenant. This section shall
not apply to stand alone commercial buildings occupied by a

ditch, into any river or stream or into any storm sewer or
drain, or permit such materials to be so discharged.
(b) Discharges to storm sewers. Roof leaders, surface
drains, groundwater drains, foundation footing drains and
other clear water drains shall be connected wherever possible
with a storm sewer, but they shall not be connected to a
building sewer which discharges into a sanitary sewer or
private sewage treatment plant. Air conditioning and clear
water drains not described in this subsection shall also
discharge to storm drains or sewers, unless special permission
is obtained from the Inspection Supervisor in cases where an
unnecessary hardship would result and where the spirit of this
subsection would be observed. If stormwater or clear water is
being discharged into a sanitary sewer the Inspection
Supervisor shall give the offending person fifteen (15) days
notice to disconnect. Failure to disconnect after such notice
shall authorize the Director to cause disconnection and
assessment of the costs of such disconnection against the
property involved. The Director may, in the alternative,
institute action for violation of this subsection.
(c) Discharge to public streets. No person shall
discharge any clear water directly into a public street or alley
from November 1 to March 31, inclusive. No person shall
discharge any clear water directly into a public street or alley
from April 1 to October 31, inclusive, without first obtaining
permission from the Public Works Director or an authorized
representative.
(d) Discharge onto sidewalks. No person shall permit
the regular discharge of water directly onto any sidewalk or
other public area. Such discharge shall constitute a nuisance.
(e) Other discharges. Where a storm sewer is not
available or suitable, as determined by the City of Appleton
Engineering Department, clear water shall be discharged onto
the ground surface at least four (4) feet from the foundation of
the building (this shall include discharge from downspouts).
Such discharge shall not be directed so as to flow on adjacent
property nor shall the discharge be allowed to accumulate and
create ponds of standing water or other public nuisance.
Nothing contained in this subsection shall act to relieve a
person from complying with the other provisions of this
section.

hundred percent (100%) shall pass a one-half (½) inch sieve.
(e) Underground building drains shall be laid on original
or firm ground or thoroughly compacted material. Voids
between such firm foundation and the bottom of the pipe,
along its entire length, shall be filled with bedding stone as
specified for building sewers.
(f) An approved backwater valve shall be installed in
the sanitary sewer lateral of every new building and shall be
accessible to the property owner for service or replacement
except as provided below. The required backwater valve
shall not be installed in the public right-of-way.
Exception. A property owner may apply in writing to the
plumbing inspector for an exception to the provision of (f).
The application must include evidence of the elevation of
both the lowest floor level served by sanitary sewer and the
nearest downstream manhole to which the sanitary building
drain is or will be connected. The plumbing inspector may
approve the exception if the elevation of the lowest floor level
served by the sanitary sewer is at least one (1) foot higher
than the elevation of the nearest manhole to which the
sanitary building drain is or will be connected.

the unit discharge into such wet vent shall be limited to one
(1) fixture unit for a one-and-one-half (1½) inch vent or two
(2) fixture units for a two-inch vent pipe.
(d) Wherever possible, all changes in direction from
vertical to horizontal on any vent shall be made above the
overflow rim of the fixture. Where a vent is connected to a
horizontal soil or waste pipe and is not a wet vent, such vent
shall, where impossible to rise vertically, rise at not less than
twenty-two and one-half (22½) degrees until the bottom of
the horizontal vent is above the horizontal soil or waste pipe
which it serves. The horizontal vent shall have a slope of not
less than one-fourth (¼) inch per foot, shall be installed with

Supp. #89
ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 6-1. Intent of chapter.
It is the intent of this chapter to prescribe regulations
consistent with the nationally recognized standard practice
for the safeguarding, to a reasonable degree, of life and
property from the hazards of fire and explosion arising
from the storage, handling and use of hazardous
substances, materials and devices, from conditions
hazardous to life and property in the use or occupancy of
buildings or premises, and the adequacy of exit systems.
(Code 1965, §19.01; Ord 1-91, §1(19.01), 1-9-91; Ord 23-
09, §1, 1-13-09, Ord 25-18, §1, 2-27-18)
Sec. 6-2. Fire equipment.
(a) No person shall molest, tamper with, damage or
otherwise disturb any apparatus, equipment or
appurtenance belonging to or under the supervision and
control of the Fire Department without authority from the
Chief or his/her authorized representative.
(b) No person shall remove, tamper with or
otherwise disturb any fire hydrant or fire appliance
required to be installed or maintained under the provisions
of this code, except for the purpose of extinguishing fires,
training purposes, recharging or making necessary repairs
or when permitted by the Fire Department. Whenever a
fire appliance is removed as permitted herein, it shall be
replaced or reinstalled as soon as the purpose for which it
was removed has been accomplished. No person shall use
or operate any hydrant or other valves installed on any
water system intended for use by the Fire Chief for fire
suppression purpose, and which is accessible to any
public highway, alley or private way open to or generally
used by the public, unless such person first secures
permission from the Fire Department. This section does
not apply to the use of a hydrant or other valves by a
person employed by and authorized to make such use by
the Water Department which supplies water to such
hydrants or other valves.
(c) No person shall place or keep any post, fence,
vehicle, growth, trash, storage or other material near any
fire hydrant, Fire Department connection or fire
protection system control valve that would prevent such
equipment or hydrant from being immediately discernible
or in any other manner deter or hinder the Fire
Department from gaining immediate access to the
equipment or hydrant. A minimum three- (3-) foot clear
space shall be maintained around the circumference of the
fire hydrants except as otherwise required or approved by
the Fire Chief.
(d) Where on-site fire hydrants are required on
private property, the City shall annually inspect, flush
and, if necessary, paint said hydrants for the fee per
hydrant on file with the City Clerk's Office. The owner
shall be notified of any repairs or maintenance necessary,
and it shall be the owner’s responsibility to see that any
repair or maintenance is performed in accordance with the
National Fire Protection Association Standard 25, the City
Water Utility’s standard operating procedures and the
American Water Works Standards for fire hydrant
maintenance. The property owner or agent must call
between April 1 and October 1 of each year to schedule the
annual flush and inspection.
(e) The property owner or agent shall keep and
maintain records indicating when the hydrants are flushed,
painted and maintained. These records shall be made
available to the City upon request.

reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building

Art. V. HEALTH IN ALL POLICIES
Sec. 7-200. Findings.
(a) Health starts where we live, learn, work and play, and
everyday decisions within the City of Appleton can promote
greater health and equity.
(b) All Appleton residents should have the opportunity to
make the choices that allow them to live a long, healthy life,
regardless of their job, neighborhood of residence, level of
education, immigration status, sexual orientation, ethnic
background or religion.
(c) Good health enhances quality of life, improves
workforce productivity, increases the capacity for learning,
strengthens families and communities, supports
environmental sustainability and helps reduce overall
economic and social insecurity.
(d) In the city of Appleton, those at greatest risk for poor
health outcomes are low-income residents, who have a shorter
life expectancy than other city residents.
(e) Appleton residents are primarily affected by heart
disease, cancer and stroke.
(f) Recognizing the presence of critical health disparities
in the community and the opportunity to intervene on health
outcomes, the City has developed and defined public health
broadly in the City Comprehensive Plan.
(g) Health in All Policies is fundamentally about creating
systems-level change both within City departments and in the
community.
(h) In developing strategies to address health disparities, it
is important to recognize that at its heart, promoting equity is
not just about providing more services.
(i) It is also about how services are developed, prioritized
and delivered.
(j) The Health in All Policies strategy guides the City of
Appleton on how to address the social determinants of health,
or the root causes of current health disparities in the
development, prioritization and delivery of these services and
policies.
Sec. 7-201. Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this
ordinance unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
(a) Health in All Policies (HiAP) is both a process and a
goal.
(1) The goal of HiAP is to address inequities at the
systems, policy and structural levels to eliminate
the resulting health disparities.
(2) At the root of HiAP is an approach to improving
health of all people by incorporating health
considerations into collaborative decision-making
across sectors, agencies, and departments. HiAP
brings city departments and community groups
together to identify ways in which all policies can
take health outcomes into consideration. The
HiAP process places health at the center of all
work, and through discussion and compromise,
gains stakeholder buy-in from all agencies,
groups, and departments.
(3) Health in All Policies works to create a new
policy and organizing framework within city
government and beyond in the community. It
emphasizes the consequences of public policies,
plans, and programs on health determinants, and
aims to improve health outcomes at all levels of
government within the city and those agencies
responsible for serving Appleton residents.
(4) Stakeholder engagement is essential for ensuring
that Health in All Policies is responsive to
community needs. Community-based knowledge
provides important information about
opportunities and barriers for health and insight
into the ways in which policies may impede or
promote health.
(b) Health is not simply the absence of disease, but the
state of complete physical, mental, cultural and social wellbeing.
HiAP is based on the premise that good health is
fundamental for a strong economy and vibrant society, and
that health outcomes are largely dependent on the social
determinants of health, which in turn are shaped by decisions
made within the health sector and internally and externally
outside of the health sector.
(c) Health equity refers to efforts to ensure that all people
have full and equal access to opportunities that enable them to
lead healthy lives, while respecting differences that include
but are not limited to culture, language, race, gender,
sexuality, economic status, citizenship, ability, age and
religion.
(1) Health equity entails focused societal efforts to
address avoidable inequalities by equalizing the
conditions for health for all groups, especially for
those who have experienced socioeconomic
disadvantage or historical injustices.
HEALTH AND SANITATION
Supp. #90
501
(2) These communities include, but are not limited to
women, people of color, low-income individuals
and families, individuals who have been
incarcerated, individuals with disabilities,
individuals with mental health conditions, youth
and young adults, seniors, immigrants and
refugees, individuals who are limited-English
proficient (LEP), and lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, questioning, intersex and asexual
(LGBTQIA) communities, or combinations of
these populations.
(d) Health disparities are differences of presence of
disease, health outcomes, or access to care among distinct
segments of the populations, including differences that occur
by race or ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,
education or income, immigration status, age, disability or
functional impairment, or geographic location, or the
combination of any of these factors.
(e) Health inequities are health disparities resulting from
factors that are systemic and avoidable and, therefore,
considered unjust or unfair.

functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. The social

events, but rather the unrelieved accumulation of these events
over one’s life.

extent of the law equal opportunity employment and public

of any state, or any reserve component of the United States

or perceived affiliation with any of these protected
categories. To fully effectuate this policy of promoting
nondiscrimination, the city shall endeavor to eliminate all
discrimination that may occur within employment and
accommodation within the city of Appleton.

and applied consistently with the provisions of Title VIII of

company, corporation or association shall construct, install,
maintain or operate a cable television system within the
City, or within any other public property of the City, unless
a franchise has first been obtained pursuant to the
provisions of this article, and unless such franchise is in
full force and effect. Such franchise shall not take the
place of any other license or permit which may be legally
required of the grantee in order to conduct such a business,
or construct or install buildings, structures, facilities or
equipment within the City.
(b) Franchise applications.
(1) After receiving applications for a franchise, the
City, after considering the legal, financial,
technical and character qualifications of the
applicants, may grant one or more nonexclusive
franchises creating a right to construct
and operate a cable television system within the
public ways of the City. Franchise(s) may be
granted to the applicant(s) which in the City's
judgment may best serve the public interest;
provided, however, no provision of this article
shall be deemed or construed as to require the
City to grant a franchise.
(2) The application for an initial cable television
franchise shall be submitted to the Council or its
designee, on a written application form
furnished by the City, and in accordance with
procedures and schedules established by the
City. The application form may request facts

nonrefundable application fee in an amount
determined by the City, which amount shall be
used by the City to offset direct expenses
incurred in the franchising and evaluation
procedures, including, but not limited to, staff
time and consulting assistance.

grants a non-exclusive franchise shall, in
addition to the nonrefundable fee specified
herein above, pay to the City at the time the
grantee files the written instrument specified in
§9-158(c), an amount to be determined by the
Council to be used to offset all direct,
reasonable costs incurred by the City in granting
the franchise not defrayed by fees forthcoming
from the provisions of paragraph (2) of this
section.
(4) After passage of this article, no cable operator
shall be granted a franchise by the City in which
terms and conditions differ materially from
those set forth in this article. In the event that
the City grants a non-identical franchise to
another cable operator, grantee shall have the
right to comply instead with any less stringent
terms and conditions of the subsequent
franchise and to receive other appropriate
adjustments in the event there is no
economically reasonable way for the grantee to
reduce its franchise requirements to less
stringent levels.
Sec. 9-155. Franchise conditions.
(a) Franchise term and non-exclusivity. The term of an
original franchise shall not be more than ten (10) years
from the date the franchise is accepted by the grantee. The
term of a renewed franchise shall be no more than fifteen
(15) years. No franchise granted pursuant to this article
shall give any exclusive right to a grantee and every such
franchise shall be deemed to reserve the right to grant other
franchises to use and occupy the public ways of the City
for cable television pursuant to the provisions of this
article.
(b) Notice to the grantee. Except as otherwise provided
in this article, the Council shall not meet to take any final
action involving the review, renewal, revocation or
termination of the grantee's franchise unless the City has
(1) advised the grantee in writing, at least thirty (30) days
prior to such meeting, as to its time, place and purpose; and
(2) published a notice, at least once, ten (10) days before
the meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within
the City. The cost of such notification shall be borne by the
City.
(c) Modification of franchise obligations. The
provisions of §625 of the Cable Communications Policy
Act of 1984 (as it may hereinafter be modified or amended)
are adopted by reference and made a part of this article
with the same force and effect as though set forth herein.
(d) Performance evaluation session.
(1) The Council and the grantee shall hold
scheduled performance evaluation sessions
within thirty (30) days of the third, sixth and
ninth anniversary dates of the grantee's award of
the franchise and as required by federal and
state law. All such evaluation sessions shall be
LICENSES, PERMITS AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS
Supp. #89
622
open to the public. The City shall be solely
responsible for notifying the grantee, in writing,
at least sixty (60) days in advance, of each of
the specified performance evaluation sessions.
In addition, either party may request a special
evaluation session.
(2) All evaluation sessions shall be open to the
public and announced by the City Council in a
newspaper of general circulation in accordance
with the notice requirements of paragraph (b) of
this section. Grantee shall notify subscribers of
all evaluation sessions by announcement on at
least one (1) appropriate channel on the system
between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.
for five (5) consecutive days preceding each
session.
(3) Topics which may be discussed at any
scheduled or special evaluation session may
include, but not be limited to, franchise fees,
penalties, free or discounted services,
applications of new technologies, system
performance, services provided, programming
offered, customer complaints, judicial and FCC
rulings, line extension policies and grantee or
Council rules.
(4) During a review and evaluation by the Council,
the grantee shall fully cooperate with the
Council and shall provide such relevant
information and documents as the Council may
need to reasonably perform its review.
(5) If at any time during its review, the Council
determines that reasonable evidence exists of
inadequate cable system performance, it may
require the grantee to perform tests and analyses
directed toward the suspected inadequacies. The
grantee shall fully cooperate with the Council in
performing such testing and shall prepare
results and a report if requested within thirty
(30) days after notice. Such a report shall
include the following information:
a. The nature of the complaint or problem
which precipitated the special tests:
b. What system component was tested;
c. The equipment used and procedures
employed in testing;
d. The method, if any, in which such
complaint or problem was resolved;
e. Any other information pertinent to said
tests and analyses which may be required.
f. The City may require the test to be
supervised by a professional engineer not
on the permanent staff of the grantee. Any
expense for said supervision shall be jointly
shared by the City and the grantee.
(6) The City's right under this paragraph shall be
limited to requiring tests, analyses and reports
covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on said complaints or other evidence
when and under such circumstances as the City
has reasonable grounds to believe that the
complaints or other evidence require that test be
performed to protect the public against
substandard cable service.
(e) Franchise renewal. Renewal of this franchise shall
be governed by applicable federal law.
(f) Franchise revocation procedures.
(1) Whenever a grantee shall refuse, neglect or
willfully fail to construct, operate or maintain
its cable television system or to provide service
to its subscribers in substantial accordance with
the terms of this article and the franchise, or to
comply with the conditions of occupancy of any
public ways, or to make required extensions of
service, or in any other way substantially violate
the terms and conditions of this article, the
franchise, or any applicable rule or regulation,
or practices any proven fraud or deceit upon the
City or its subscribers, or fails to pay timely
franchise fees or other payments, such as real
estate or personal property taxes dues to the
City, or if a grantee becomes insolvent, or
unable to or unwilling to pay its uncontested
debts, or is adjudged bankrupt or seeks relief
under the bankruptcy laws, then the franchise
may be subject to revocation pursuant to
existing rules of the Council.
(2) In the event the City believes that grounds for
revocation exist or have existed, the City shall
notify a grantee, in writing, setting forth the
nature and facts of such noncompliance. If,
within sixty (60) days following such written
notification, the grantee has not furnished
reasonably satisfactory evidence that corrective
action has been taken or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, or that the alleged
violations did not occur, or that the alleged
violations were beyond the grantee's control, the
City shall thereupon refer the matter to the
Common Council. Upon good cause shown as
determined by the Council, the grantee shall
receive an extension of the sixty- (60-) day time
APPLETON CODE
Supp. #89
623
limit contained herein.
(3) The Council shall not revoke a franchise
pursuant to subparagraph 1 of this section until
it has given notice to the grantee that it proposes
to take such an action and the grounds therefore.
In any revocation hearing held by the Council,
both the grantee and the City shall be afforded
fair opportunity for full participation, including
the right to introduce evidence and to question
witnesses. The revocation hearing shall be
conducted pursuant to Wisconsin Rules of
Evidence and a transcript of proceeding shall be
made. Grantee shall have the right to appeal an
adverse decision to a circuit court of competent
jurisdiction.
(4) A grantee shall not be subject to the sanctions of
this section for any act or omission wherein
such act or omission was beyond the grantee's
control. An act or omission shall not be deemed
to be beyond the grantee's control if committed,
omitted, or caused by a corporation or other
business entity, which holds a controlling
interest in the grantee, whether held directly or
indirectly. Further, the inability of a grantee to
obtain financing, for whatever reason, shall not
be an act or omission which is “beyond the
grantee's control.”
(5) The termination of a grantee's rights under a
franchise shall in no way affect any other rights
the City or grantee may have under the
franchise or under any provision of law.
(6) Upon lawful revocation of the franchise, grantee
shall be required to remove all aerial equipment
or at its option to transfer, by sale or lease, its
cable system to a third party within six (6)
months of the Council's notification of
revocation.
(g) Franchise fee.
(1) The grantee, in consideration of the privilege
granted under the franchise for the operation of
a cable television system within the public ways
of the City, and the expense of regulation
pursuant to the franchise incurred by the City,
shall pay to the City four percent (4%) of its
annual gross receipts during the period of its
operation under the franchise; or the maximum
amount as may be set from time to time by
controlling federal or state law, if such
maximum is less than four percent (4%). Said
fee may be subject to renegotiation upon
agreement by both parties at such time as
applicable laws and regulation permit; provided,
however, no such negotiated franchise fee shall
be greater than five percent (5%) of gross
receipts.
(2) The grantee shall file with the City within thirty
(30) days after the expiration of the grantee's
franchise year, a gross receipts statement clearly
showing the gross receipts received by the
grantee during the previous franchise year, and
shall simultaneously tender payment of the
annual franchise fee. The grantee shall also file,
upon request by the City, within one hundred
fifty (150) days following the conclusion of
each calendar year during which the franchise
period is in effect (franchise year), an annual
report prepared and audited by a certified public
accountant acceptable to the City, clearly
showing the yearly total gross receipts. The
City, at its option, may accept an unaudited
gross receipts report prepared by the grantee.
(3) The City shall have the right consistent with the
provision of §9-156 herein, to inspect the
grantee's revenue records, the right of audit and
the recomputation of any amounts determined
to be payable under this article. Any additional
amount due the City as a result of the audit shall
be paid within thirty (30) days following written
notice to the grantee by the City, which notice
shall include a copy of the audit report. The cost
of the audit shall be borne by the grantee if it is
properly determined that the grantee's annual
payment due the City for the preceding year is
increased thereby by more than five percent
(5%).
(4) In the event that any franchise payment or
recomputed amount is not made on or before
the applicable dates heretofore specified,
interest shall be charged from said due date at
the rate of one percent (1%) per month.
(h) Insurance; bonds; indemnity.
(1) Upon the granting of a franchise and within
thirty (30) days following the filing of the
acceptance required under §9-158(c) hereof and
at all times during the term of the franchise,

failure by grantee to secure consents from the
owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of
programs to be delivered by the grantee's cable
system whether or not any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or
prohibited by the franchise. Indemnified
expenses shall include, but not be limited to, all
out-of-pocket expenses, such as attorney fees,
and shall also include the reasonable value of
any services rendered by the City Attorney or
APPLETON CODE

his assistants, or any consultants, agents and
employees of the City.
(i) Transfer of franchise.
(1) A franchise granted under this article shall be a
privilege to be held in personal trust by the
grantee. It shall not be assigned, transferred,
sold or disposed of, in whole or in part, by
voluntary sale, sale and leaseback, merger,
consolidation or otherwise or by forced or
involuntary sale, without prior consent of the
Council expressed by resolution. Such approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, i.e. in
exercising the foregoing approval authority, the
City may reasonably consider the qualifications
of the proposed purchaser to fulfill the lawful
terms and conditions of this article, but may not
impose any additional terms or conditions as a
prerequisite to approval. The proposed assignee
agrees to comply with all the provisions of this
article and the franchise and reasonable
amendments thereto, and must be able to
provide proof of legal, technical, financial and
character qualifications as determined by the
Council.
(2) Any sale, transfer or assignment authorized by
the Council shall occur according to normal
business practices and be filed with the City.
(3) Prior approval of the Council shall be required
where ownership or control of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the right of control of the
grantee is acquired during the term of the
franchise in any transaction or series of
transactions by a person or group of persons
acting in concert, none of whom owned or
controlled fifty percent (50%) or more of such
right of control, singularly or collectively on the
effective date of the franchise. By its acceptance
of this franchise the grantee specifically grants
and agrees that any such acquisition occurring
without prior approval of the Council shall
render the franchise void. Such approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld by the Council.
(4) The consent of the Council to any sale, transfer,
lease, trust, mortgage or other instrument of
hypothecation shall not constitute waiver or
release of any of the rights of the City under this
article and the franchise.
Sec. 9-156. Subscriber fees and records.
(a) All charges to subscribers shall be consistent with a
schedule of fees as established by the grantee for particular
service levels. Changes in the basic service fee schedule
shall not take effect until at least thirty (30) days after
notification of same is delivered to the Council.
(b) The grantee shall not, with regard to service,
discriminate or grant any preference or advantage to any
person based on race, creed or religion; provided, however,
that the grantee may establish different service levels for
different classes of subscribers, provided that the grantee
not discriminate between any subscribers of the same class.
(c) The grantee shall be required to apprise in writing
each new subscriber of all applicable fees and charges for
providing cable television service.
(d) Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise,
a subscriber shall have the right to have its service
disconnected without charge; such disconnection shall be
made as soon as practicable and in no case later than thirty
(30) days following notice to the grantee of same and, if
requested, shall remove all of grantee's equipment from the
subscriber's property. No grantee shall enter into any
agreement with a subscriber which imposes any charge
following disconnection of service, except for reconnection
and subsequent monthly or periodic charges and payment
on any delinquent account, and those charges shall be no
greater than charges for new customers. This section shall
not prevent a grantee from refusing service to any person
because the grantee's prior accounts with that person
remain due and owing.
(e) Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise,
a grantee may offer service which requires advance
payment of periodic service charge for no more than one
(1) year in advance subject to the conditions contained in
this paragraph. A customer shall have the right, at any time,
to have his/her service disconnected with a refund of
unused service charges paid to the customer within thirty
(30) days from the date of service.
Sec. 9-157. System operations.
(a) Franchise areas.
(1) Grantee will offer service to all occupied
residential dwellings without discrimination, in
all areas within the City, not otherwise wired for
cable service, provided, however, that grantee
shall not be required to offer or extend service
to any area where there are fewer than forty (40)
occupied residential dwellings per cable mile.
(2) Grantee must extend and make cable television
service available to any isolated resident within
or without the franchise area requesting
connection at the standard connection charge, if
the connection to the isolated resident would
require no more than a standard one hundred
fifty (150) foot aerial or buried drop line.
LICENSES, PERMITS AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS
Supp. #89
626
(3) With respect to requests for connection
requiring an aerial or buried drop line in excess
of one hundred fifty (150) feet, grantee must
extend and make available cable television
service to such residents at a connection charge
not to exceed the actual installation costs
incurred by the grantee for the distance
exceeding one hundred fifty (150) feet.
(b) Systems description and service.
(1) The cable television system to be installed by
grantee shall comply in all respects with the
technical performance requirements set forth in
the FCC’s Rules for Cable Television including
applicable amendments thereto; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall be
construed to prohibit the grantee from
proposing to comply with more rigid technical
performance requirements, in which case the
grantee's application shall be incorporated by
reference in the franchise and will be binding on
the grantee. If the FCC should delete said
requirements, the City hereby reserves the right
to amend this article to incorporate similar
standards and every franchise granted pursuant
to this article shall be subject to such reserved
power whether or not expressly so conditioned.
(2) Applications for franchise shall, to the extent
provided in §611 and §626, Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, include
proposals for the provision of public,
educational/cultural and local government
channels. Such proposals by a grantee shall be
incorporated in to the franchise granted, and
shall be subject to the following requirements:
a. The grantee shall have available equipment
for local production and presentation of
cablecast programs other than automated
services and permit its use for the
production and presentation of public
access programs with thirty (30) days’
notice. The grantee shall not enter into any
contract, arrangement or lease for use of its
cablecast equipment which prevents or
inhibits the use of such equipment for a
substantial portion of time for public access
programming.
b. The grantee shall have no control over the
content of access cablecast programs;
however, this limitation shall not prevent
the grantee from taking appropriate steps to
insure compliance with the operating rules
described herein; failure by the grantee to
comply with such operating rules shall
constitute a violation of this article.
c. The local government access channel(s)
shall be made available for the use of local
government authorities free of charge.
(3) Grantee shall provide, without charge within the
franchise area, one service outlet activated for
regular subscriber service to each fire station,
school, police station, public library, and such
other buildings used for governmental purposes
as may be designated by the City and agreed to
by grantee; provided, however, that it is
necessary to extend grantee's truck or feeder
lines more than three hundred (300) feet solely
to provide service to any such school or public
building, the City or such other building owner
shall have the option either of paying grantee's
direct costs for such extension in excess of three
hundred (300) feet, or of releasing grantee from
the obligation to provide service to such
building. Furthermore, grantee shall be
permitted to recover, from any public building
owner entitled to free basic service, the direct
cost of installing, when requested to do so, more
than one (1) outlet, or concealed inside wiring,
or a service outlet requiring more than two
hundred fifty (250) feet of drop cable; provided,
however, that the grantee shall not charge for
the provision of regular basic subscriber service
to the additional service outlets once installed.
(4) A grantee, and all other persons using or
making use of the cable communications
system(s), shall comply with all federal, state
and local laws, rules and regulations regarding
the exhibition, display or showing of obscene or
indecent material.
(5) At the option of the subscriber, a Grantee shall
provide a device capable of locking out any
premium programming video and audio signals.
(c) Operational requirements and records.
(1) Grantee shall construct, operate and maintain
the cable television system in full compliance
with the rules and regulations, including
applicable amendments, of the Federal
Communications Commission and all other
applicable federal, state or local laws and
regulations, including the latest editions of the
National Electrical Safety Code and the
National Fire Protection Association National
Electrical Code. The cable television system
and all its parts shall be subject to by the City,
and the City hereby reserves the right to review
APPLETON CODE
Supp. #89
627
a grantee’s construction plans prior to the
commencement of construction.
(2) Grantee shall maintain an office or customer
service location within the City which shall be
open and accessible to the public with adequate
telephone service during normal business hours.
Grantee shall employ an operator or maintain a
telephone answering service twenty-four (24)
hours per day, each day of the year, to receive
subscriber complaints.
(3) Grantee shall exercise its best effort to design,
construct, operate and maintain the system at all
times so that signals carried are delivered to
subscribers without material degradation in
quality (within the limitations imposed by the
technical state-of-the-art).
(4) Copies of all correspondence, petitions, reports,
applications and other documents sent or
received by grantee from federal or state
agencies having appropriate jurisdiction in
matters affecting local cable television
operation shall be simultaneously furnished by
the grantee to the agency.
(5) In the case of any emergency or disaster, the
grantee shall, upon request of the City, make
available its facilities to the City, without costs,
for emergency use during the emergency or
disaster period.
(d) Tests and performance monitoring.
(1) Not later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after any new or substantially rebuilt portion
of the system is made available for service to
subscribers, technical performance tests shall
be conducted by the grantee to demonstrate
full compliance with the technical standards
of the Federal Communications Commission.
Such tests shall be performed by, or under the
supervision of, a qualified registered
professional engineer or an engineer with
proper training and experience. A copy of the
report shall be submitted to the City,
describing test results, instrumentation,
calibration and test procedures, and the
qualifications of the engineer responsible for
the tests.
(2) System monitor test points shall be
established at or near the output of the last
amplifier in the longest feeder line, at or near
trunk line extremities, or at the locations to be
specified in the franchise. Such periodic tests
shall be made at the test points as shall be
described by the City.
(3) At any time after commencement of services
to subscribers, the City may require additional
reasonable tests, including full or partial
repeat tests, different test procedures, or tests
involving a specific subscriber's terminal, at
the grantee's expense to the extent such tests
may be performed by the grantee's employees
utilizing its existing facilities and equipment;
provided, however, that the City reserves the
right to conduct its own tests upon reasonable
notice to the grantee and if non-compliance is
found, the expense thereof shall be borne by
the grantee. The City will endeavor to arrange
its request for special tests so as to minimize
hardship or inconvenience to grantee or to the
subscriber.
(4) Any copies of ongoing technical maintenance
tests performed by the grantee shall be
retained by the grantee for by the City for one
(1) calendar year after the conclusion of each
year.
(5) The City shall have the right to employ
qualified consultants if necessary or desirable
to assist in the administration of this or any
other, section of this article. The expense of
said consultants shall be borne by the City.
(e) Service, adjustment and complaint procedure.
(1) Except for circumstances beyond the grantee's
control such as strikes, acts of God, weather,
wars, riots and civil disturbances, the grantee
shall establish a maintenance service capable of
locating and correcting major system
malfunctions promptly. Said maintenance
service shall be available at all hours, to correct
such major system malfunctions affecting a
number of subscribers.
(2) A listed local telephone number shall be made
available to subscribers for service calls at any
time of the day or night. Investigative action
shall be initiated reasonably promptly in
response to all service calls, other than major
outages. Corrective action shall be completed as
promptly as practicable. Appropriate records
shall be made of service calls showing when
and what corrective action was completed.
Upon request, such records shall be made
available to the City for audit during normal
business hours and retained in grantee's files for
not less than one (1) year.
(3) The grantee shall furnish each subscriber at the
LICENSES, PERMITS AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS
Supp. #89
628
time service is installed written instructions that
clearly set forth procedures for placing a service
call, or requesting an adjustment. Said
instructions shall also include the name, address
and telephone number of the agency or other
designated employee of the City and a reminder
that the subscriber can call or write the agency
or other designated employee for information
regarding terms and conditions of the grantee's
franchise if the grantee fails to respond to the
subscriber's request for installation, service or
adjustment within a reasonable period of time.
(4) In the event a subscriber does not obtain a
satisfactory response or resolution to his request
for service or an adjustment within a reasonable
period of time, he may advise the agency or
other designated employee in writing of his
dissatisfaction and the agency or other
designated employee shall have the authority to
investigate the matter and order corrective
action as may be appropriate.
(5) The grantee shall interrupt system service after
7:00 a.m. and before 1:00 a.m. of the following
day only with good cause and for the shortest
time possible and, except in emergency
situations, only after cablecasting notice of
service interruption at least twenty-four (24)
hours in advance of the service interruption.
Service may be interrupted between 1:00 a.m.
and 7:00 a.m. for routine testing, maintenance
and repair on any day except Saturday or
Sunday, or a holiday. The service interruptions
described herein do not include what is
commonly referred to as “sweeping”.
(f) Street occupancy.
(1) Grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and
other facilities whenever possible, and shall not
construct or install any new, different or
additional poles, conduits, or other facilities
whether on the public way or on privatelyowned
property, until the written approval of
the appropriate governmental authority, and, if
necessary, of the property owner is obtained,
and which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld by the municipality. However, no
location of any pole or wire-holding structure of
the grantee shall be a vested interest and such
poles or structures shall be removed or modified
by the grantee at its own expense whenever the
City or other governmental authority determines
that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby.
(2) Where the City or a public utility serving the
City desires to make use of the poles or other
wireholding structures of the grantee but
agreement therefore with the grantee cannot be
reached, the City may require the grantee to
permit such use for such consideration and upon
such terms as the City shall determine to be just
and reasonable, if the City determines that the
use would enhance the public convenience and
would not unduly interfere with the grantee's
operations.
(3) All transmission lines, equipment and structures
shall be so installed and located as to cause
minimum interference with the rights and
appearance and reasonable convenience of
property owners who adjoin on any public way
and at all times shall be kept and maintained in
a safe, adequate, and substantial condition, and
in good order and repair. The grantee shall at all
times employ reasonable care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and
accidents which are likely to cause damage,
injuries, or nuisances to the public. Suitable
barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices
shall be used at such times and places as are
reasonably required for the safety of all
members of the public. Any poles or other
fixtures placed in any public way by the grantee
shall be placed in such a manner as not to
interfere with the usual travel on such public
way, and only after obtaining and complying
with appropriate street occupancy permits from
the City.
(4) Grantee shall remove, replace, or modify at its
own expense, the installation of any of its
facilities as may be deemed necessary by the
City or other appropriate governmental
authority to meet its proper responsibilities.
(5) All installations shall be underground in those
areas of the City where public utilities providing
both telephone and electric service are
underground at the time of installation. In areas
where either telephone or electric utility
facilities are above ground at the time of
installation, the grantee may install its service
above ground, provided that at such time as
those facilities are required to be placed
underground by the City or are placed
underground, the grantee shall likewise place its
services underground without additional cost to
the City. If the facilities of either the electric or
the telephone utility are aerial, the cable
television facilities may be located underground
at the request of a property owner, provided that
the excess cost over aerial location shall be
APPLETON CODE
Supp. #89
629
borne by the property owner making the
request.
(6) In the event of a physical disturbance of any
public way or private property by the grantee, it
shall, at its own expense and in a manner
approved by the City or other appropriate
governmental authority and the owner, replace
and restore such public way or private property
in as reasonably good a condition as before the
work causing such disturbance was done. In the
event the grantee fails to perform such
replacement or restoration, the City or the
owner shall have the right to do so at the sole
expense of the grantee. Demand for payment to
the City or owner for such replacement or
restoring of such roads or private property as
may have been disturbed must be in writing to
the grantee.
(7) Whenever, in case of fire or other disaster, it
becomes necessary in the judgment of the City
to remove or damage any of the grantee’s
facilities, no charge shall be made by the
grantee against the City for restoration and
repair.
(8) At the request of any person holding a valid
building permit issued by the City or other
appropriate governmental authority, and upon at
least forty-eight (48) hours notice, grantee shall
temporarily raise, lower, or cut its wires as may
be necessary to facilitate such move. The direct
expense of such temporary changes, including
standby time, shall be paid by the permit holder,
and grantee shall have the authority to require
payment in advance.
(9) Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees on
public property at its own expense as may be
necessary to protect its wires and facilities,
subject to the supervision and direction of the
City or other appropriate governmental
authority.
(g) Construction schedule and reports.
(1) Upon accepting the franchise, grantee shall,
within sixty (60) days, file the documents
required to obtain all necessary federal, state
and local licenses, permits and authorizations
required for the conduct of its business, and
shall submit monthly reports to the City on
progress in this respect until all such documents
are in hand. Failure of the grantee to pursue all
necessary steps to secure the aforementioned
authorizations with due diligence shall
constitute a substantial violation of this article.
(2) The grantee shall commence construction of the
cable system within eight (8) months after
receiving all necessary permits, authorizations
and licenses, and shall complete construction of
the system in the franchise area and offer and be
capable of delivering cable television service in
full accordance with this article and the
franchise granted hereunder to subscribers in
not less than fifty percent (50%) of the occupied
dwelling units in the franchise area within
twelve (12) months after commencing
construction, and shall be capable of delivering
service to the remaining fifty percent (50%) of
the occupied dwelling units in the franchise area
in the succeeding twelve (12) month period
thereafter, or such lesser periods as shall be
specified in the franchise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, failure of the grantee for any reason
to commence construction within twelve (12)
months of the date of acceptance of the
franchise shall be grounds for revocation of the
franchise. For the purpose of this section,
construction shall be deemed to have
commenced when the first aerial strand cable
has been attached to a pole, or the first
underground trench has been opened.
(3) Franchise applications shall include a timetable
showing the percentage of occupied dwelling
units within the primary service area that will be
capable of receiving cable television service
each year of construction. Said timetable shall
be incorporated into the franchise and shall be
enforceable as to the grantee under the
provisions of this article.
(4) Each grantee shall fill all requests for cable
service, once facilities are in place consistent
with the foregoing schedule of service, within
thirty (30) days after the date of each request. A
record of all service requests shall be kept for at
least one (1) year and shall be available for
public inspection at the local office of the
grantee during regular office hours with
reasonable advance notice.
(5) Within three (3) months after accepting the
franchise, grantee shall furnish the City a
complete construction schedule and map setting
forth target dates by areas for commencement of
service to subscribers. The schedule and map
shall be updated whenever substantial changes
become necessary.
(6) Every three (3) months after the start of
construction, grantee shall furnish the City a
report on progress of construction until
LICENSES, PERMITS AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS
Supp. #89
630
complete. The report shall include a map that
clearly defines the areas wherein regular
subscriber service is available.
(h) Protection of privacy. The provisions of §134.43 of
the Wisconsin Statutes, exclusive of any provisions thereof
relating to the penalty to be imposed or the punishment for
violation of said statute, are hereby adopted and made a
part of this section by reference. A violation of any such
provision shall be a violation of this section.
(i) Prohibition from engaging in radio and television
sales or service. The grantee, its subsidiaries and affiliates,
are specifically prohibited, directly or indirectly, from
engaging in the sale or leasing of television receivers,
video display terminals or monitors, radio receivers, or
television or radio parts, except such parts and accessories
required for any type of cable connections, such as
converters, remote controls and VCR connection plugs and
accessories, individually or with any person, anywhere in
the City, whether or not for a fee or charge, and is further
prohibited from engaging in any type of repair service to
television receivers or radio receivers.
(j) Area wide interconnection of cable systems.
(1) A grantee, at its own option, shall interconnect
access channels and/or local origination
channels of its cable television system with any
or all other cable systems providing service in
adjacent areas. While grantee may provide such
channels to multiple communities served by its
distribution systems, this section refers to
cabled areas managed by other operators which
may now or in the future offer access or local
origination channels.
(2) Grantee shall make every reasonable effort to
cooperate with cable television franchise
holders in contiguous communities in order to
provide cable service in areas outside the
grantee’s franchise area.
Sec. 9-158. General provisions.
(a) Limits on grantee’s recourse.
(1) The grantee, by accepting the franchise,
acknowledges that it has not been induced to
accept same by any promise, verbal or written,
by or on behalf of the City or by any third
person regarding any term or condition of this
article or the franchise not expressed therein.
The grantee further pledges that no promise or
inducement, oral or written, has been made to
any City employee or official regarding receipt
of the cable television franchise.
(2) Acceptance of the article shall not be construed
as a waiver by the grantee of any existing or
future right to challenge the legality of any
provision of this article. Nothing herein or in
grantee's acceptance may be construed to deny
the grantee the right to judicial review of any
action or threatened action by the City arising
out of this article.
(b) Compliance with state and federal law. The grantee
shall, at all times, comply with all laws of the state and
federal government and the rules and regulations of any
federal or state administrative agency; provided, however,
this section shall not be construed to require the City to
make an initial determination of any such violation.
Grantee and City acknowledge that this article may be
superseded by other state or federal laws, statutes or
regulations.
(c) Special license. The City reserves the right to issue a
license, easement or other permit to anyone other than the
grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the
grantee's franchise area within the City in order to provide
service outside the City. Such license or easement, absent a
grant of franchise in accordance with this article, shall not
authorize nor permit said person to provide a cable
television service of any nature to any home or place of
business within the City, nor to render any service or
connect any subscriber within the City to the grantee's
cable television system.
(d) Conflict. In case of conflict or ambiguity between
this article, the franchise and the grantee's franchise
application, the grantee and the City agree that the
franchise shall prevail.
(e) Failure to enforce franchise. The grantee shall not
be excused from complying with any of the terms and
conditions of this article or the franchise by any failure of
the City, upon any one or more occasions, to insist upon
the grantee's performance or to seek grantee's compliance
with any one or more of such terms or conditions.
(f) Rights reserved to the grantor. The City hereby
expressly reserves the following rights:
(1) To exercise its governmental powers, now or
hereafter, to the full extent that such powers
may be vested in or granted to the City.
(2) To adopt, in addition to the provisions
contained herein and in the franchise and in any
existing applicable article, such additional
reasonable regulations of general applicability
as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its
police power.
(3) The grantee at all times in the installation,
APPLETON CODE
Supp. #89
631
maintenance and operation of the cable
television system shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of City ordinances of general
applicability and to the lawful exercise of the
police power of the City provided however that
no subsequent municipal actions shall in any
way abrogate the rights granted to the grantee
herein.
(g) Employment requirement. The grantee shall not
refuse to hire, nor discharge from employment, nor
discriminate against any person regarding compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of
age, sex, race, color, creed, or national origin. The grantee
shall take affirmative action to insure that employees are
treated during employment without regard to their age, sex,
race, color, creed or national origin. This condition
includes, but is not limited to, the following: recruitment
advertising, employment interviews, employment, rates of
pay, upgrading, transfer, demotion, lay-off, and
termination.
(h) Time essence of agreement. Whenever this article
or the franchise sets forth any time for any act to be
performed by or on the behalf of the grantee, such time
shall be deemed of the essence and the grantee's failure to
perform within the time allotted shall, in all cases, be
sufficient grounds for the City to invoke the remedies
available under the terms and conditions of this article and
the franchise.
(i) Acceptance. This article and the franchise and their
terms and conditions shall be accepted by the grantee by
written instrument filed with the City within thirty (30)
days after the granting of the franchise, unless said period
is extended by the Council at its sole discretion.
(j) Publication costs. The grantee shall assume the cost
of publication of this article and franchise as such
publication is required by law and such is payable upon the
grantee's filing of acceptance as in paragraph (i) of this
article.
(k) Landlord/tenant relations.
(1) Interference with cable service prohibited.
Neither the owner of any multiple unit
residential dwelling nor his agent or
representative shall interfere with the right of
any tenant or lawful resident thereof to receive
cable television service, cable installation or
maintenance from a cable television company
regulated by and lawfully operating under a
valid and existing cable television franchise
issued by the City.
(2) Gratuities and payments to permit service
prohibited. Neither the owner of any multiple
unit residential dwelling nor his agent or

condition for permitting or cooperating with the
installation of a cable communications service
to the dwelling unit occupied by a tenant or
resident requesting service.
(3) Penalties and charges to tenants for service
prohibited. Neither the owner of any multiple
unit residential dwelling nor his agent or
representative shall knowingly penalize, charge
or surcharge a tenant or resident, or forfeit or
threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or
resident, or discriminate in any way against
such tenant or resident who requests or receives
cable communications service from a grantee
operating under a valid and existing cable
communication franchise issued by the City.
(4) Reselling service prohibited. No person shall

Sec. 12-32. Abatement – generally.
(a) Responsibility for enforcement; inspections. It
shall be the duty of each department head to enforce those
provisions of this chapter that come within the jurisdiction
of their respective offices, and each department head shall
make or cause to be made periodic inspections and
inspections upon complaint to ensure such provisions are
not violated. No action shall be taken under this section to
abate a public nuisance unless the officer has inspected or
caused to be inspected the premises where the nuisance is
alleged to exist and has satisfied himself that a nuisance
does in fact exist.
(b) Summary abatement.
(1) Order of abatement. If the inspecting officer
determines that a public nuisance exists within
the city and that there is imminent danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals or decency,
he may, without notice or hearing, issue an
order reciting the existence of a public nuisance
constituting imminent danger to the public and
requiring immediate action be taken as he
deems necessary to abate the nuisance.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
article, the order shall be effective immediately.
Any person to whom such order is directed
shall comply with the order immediately.
(2) Abatement by City. Whenever the owner or
occupant shall refuse or neglect to remove or
abate the condition described in the order, the
inspecting officer shall, in his discretion, enter
upon the premises and cause the nuisance to be
removed or abated and the City shall recover
the expenses incurred thereby from the owner
or occupant of the premises or from the person
who has caused or permitted the nuisance.
(c) Nonsummary abatement by City.
(1) Order to abate nuisance. If the inspecting
officer shall determine that a public nuisance
exists on private premises but that the nature of
such nuisance is not such as to threaten
imminent danger to the public health, safety,
peace, morals or decency, he shall issue an
order reciting the existence of a public nuisance
and requiring the owner or occupant of the
premises to remove or abate the condition
described in the order within the time period
specified therein. The order shall be served
personally on the owner of the building, as well
as the occupant if different from the owner and
applicable to the described nuisance, or, at the
option of the inspecting officer, the notice may
be mailed to the last known address of the
person, to be served by certified mail with
return receipt. If the owner or the occupant
cannot be served, the order may be served by
posting it on the main entrance of the premises
and by publishing as a Class 3 notice under
W.S.A. Chapter 985. The time limit specified
in the order runs from the date of service or
publication.
(2) Abatement by City. If the owner or occupant
fails or refuses to comply within the time period
prescribed, the inspecting officer shall enter
upon the premises and cause the nuisance to be
removed or abated and the City shall recover
the expenses incurred thereby from the owner
or occupant of the premises or from the person
who has caused or permitted the nuisance.
(3) Remedy from order. Any person affected by
such order shall, within thirty (30) days of
service or publication of the order, apply to the
Circuit Court for an order restraining the City
and the inspecting officer from entering on the
premises and abating or removing the nuisance,
or be forever barred. The court shall determine
the reasonableness of the order for abatement of
the nuisance.
(d) Authority to assess costs. The cost of the abatement
or removal of a nuisance under this section shall be
collected from the owner, occupant or person causing,
permitting or maintaining the nuisance and, if notice to

in the process of accelerating.
(Code 1965, §8.03(3)(a); §22.09(5))
(h) It shall be unlawful for any vehicle equipped with a
compression braking device (jake brakes) to use this device

except in cases of extreme emergency.
(i) Exemptions. The following activities shall be
exempt from the regulations of this section:
(1) The daytime criteria, as set forth in Tables I and

Sec. 12-83. Variances.
The City of Appleton Board of Health, upon final
approval by the Common Council, shall have the authority,
consistent with this section, to grant variances in
accordance with the following provisions.
(a) Special Variance Permits.
(1) General. A special variance permit may be
issued upon request provided that the work
producing such noise is necessary to promote
the public health or welfare and reasonable
APPLETON CODE
827
Supp. #86
steps are taken to keep such noise at the lowest
practical level.
(2) Special Community Events. A variance may
be issued for special events and similar
gatherings, festivals, presentations and the like,
which are limited in duration and are generally
acceptable to the people of the community
provided that precautions are taken to maintain
the noises produced at the lowest practical
level. The Health Officer, or designee, is
authorized to issue a variance pursuant to this
section upon receiving a complete application
for an event meeting this section’s criteria.
Applications that are not approved shall, upon
timely request of the applicant, be reviewed by
the Board of Health at their next regularly
scheduled meeting.
(3) Procedures. Any person seeking a special
variance permit pursuant to this section shall
file an application with the Health Officer, to be
submitted to the Board of Health, forty-five
(45) days prior to commencement of the event
or activity for which the variance permit is
requested. The Board of Health, however, may
waive the time limit when compliance therewith
is impractical. The application must be made in
writing and shall contain all the following
pertinent information:
a. Dates required.
b. Time and place of operation.
c. Equipment operation involved.
d. Necessity for such permit.
e. Steps to be taken to minimize noise.
f. Name of responsible person who will be
present at the operation site while the noise
is produced.
(4) Issuance. Upon final approval by the Common
Council, a special variance permit shall be
granted by notice to the applicant containing all
necessary conditions, including a time limit on
the permitted activity. The special variance
permit shall not become effective until all
conditions are agreed to by applicant.
Noncompliance with any condition of these
special variance permits shall terminate the
permit and subject the person holding it to
compliance with this article.
(5) Extension or modification. Application or
extension of time limits specified in special
variance permits or for modification of other
substantial conditions shall be treated like
applications for initial special variances.
(b) Conditional Variances.
(1) It may not be technically or economically
feasible for certain commercial or industrial
sources of sound to comply with the standards
set forth herein. Therefore, the Board of Health
may grant variances from this section if it finds
that strict compliance is unreasonable because:
a. Conditions are beyond the control of the
person requesting such variance.
b. Special circumstances exist which would
render strict compliance impractical.
c. Strict compliance would result in
substantial curtailment or closing down of
a business, plant, operation or the like.
d. Control technology is unavailable or
available only at a prohibitive cost.
e. No other alternative facility or method is
available.
(2) Application. Application for a variance permit
under this subsection shall be made in writing
to the Health Officer for submittal to the Board
of Health. Such application shall specify the
grounds upon which the variance permit is
sought and the date by which the source of any
excess noise for which the variance is sought
shall be brought into compliance with this
section. An application for a variance permit
shall be considered timely made if filed within
thirty (30) days following due notification that
it is in violation of this section. The proper
filing of an application within such time shall
toll all penalties provided in this section for any
such violation until a final decision has been
issued on the merits of such application. The
Board of Health, within a reasonable amount of
time, shall give public notice of the receipt of
an application for a variance permit.
(3) Permit. Within a reasonable time
following receipt of an application for a
variance permit and after public notice thereof
has been given, the Board shall grant such
APPLETON MUNICIPAL CODE
828
Supp. #86
permit to an applicant if the Board finds that
immediate compliance with the noise
limitations as set forth in this section would
result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant.
In making the determination, the Board of
Health shall balance the hardship to the
applicant, the community, and other persons of
not granting the variance, against the adverse
impact on health, safety, and welfare of persons
affected, the adverse effect on property affected
and any other adverse impacts of granting the
variance. Any person who claims to be
adversely affected by the allowance of the
variance permit may file a statement with the
Board of Health containing information to
support the claim. The Board of Health may
require the applicant to submit information not
contained in the application which may be
necessary for making a determination under this
subsection. Within five (5) days following the
determination, the Board of Health shall place
on file with the City Clerk a copy of the
decision which shall specify the reasons for
denying or granting the variance permit.
(4) Conditions. Upon final approval by the
Common Council, the Health Officer shall issue
a variance permit under such conditions as are
necessary to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare, including a schedule for achieving
compliance with noise limitations. Variances
exceeding two (2) years may be granted only in
exceptional cases, including those for which, in
the opinion of the Board of Health, control
technology is unavailable or available only at a
prohibitive cost. Non-compliance with any
conditions imposed on the variance shall
terminate the variance and subject the person
holding it to those provisions of this section for
which the variance permit was granted.
(5) Extension and Modification. Application for
extension of time limits or modification of other
conditions specified in the variance permit shall
be treated like applications for an initial
variance, except that the Board of Health must
find that the need for such extension or
modification clearly outweighs any adverse
impacts of granting the extension or
modification.
(6) Appeals. Any applicant or other person
aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Health or Common Council may seek such
other legal relief as may be available.

designated by the laws of Wisconsin. This section does not
prohibit the blowing of any whistle as a signal warning in
cases of peril, fire or collision or other imminent danger.

normal conditions from a distance of seventy-five (75) or
more feet.

Sec. 12-101. Disposition generally.
The provisions of W.S.A. §66.0139 are hereby adopted
by reference. Except as otherwise provided in this article,
all personal property which has been abandoned or remains
unclaimed for a period of thirty (30) days, including
bicycles or parts thereof, may be disposed of by public sale,
private sale, conversion to public use, donation to charity,
or disposed of by junking or salvage. The method of
disposal shall be at the sole option of the Police
Department. If the owner of the property is known, the
thirty (30) day period shall commence on the date of
mailing of a notice by regular mail to owner’s last known
address. If ownership is unknown, the thirty (30) day
period shall commence on the date the property is taken
into possession by the Police Department. Any property
remaining unclaimed beyond the thirty (30) day period
shall be subject to a storage fee in the amount on file in the
Police Department, commencing with the expiration of the
thirty (30) day period and continuing until the property is
reclaimed or disposed of.
(Code 1965, §10.18(6))
Sec. 12-102. Abandoned vehicles.
(a) Abandonment prohibited. No person shall leave
unattended any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or mobile
home on any public street or highway or public or private
property for such time and under such circumstances as to
cause the vehicle to reasonably appear to have been
abandoned. When any such vehicle has been left
unattended on any City street or highway or on any public
or private property within the City without permission of
the owner for more than forty-eight (48) hours, the vehicle
is deemed abandoned and constitutes a public nuisance.
(b) Impoundment. Any vehicle in violation of this
section shall be impounded until lawfully claimed or
disposed of under subsection (d) of this section, except that
if the Police Chief determines that the cost of towing and
storage charges for the impoundment would exceed the
value of the vehicle, the vehicle may be junked by the City
prior to expiration of the impoundment period upon
determination by the Police Chief or his duly authorized
representative that the vehicle is not wanted for evidence or
other reason.
(c) Notification of owner. Any vehicle which is
deemed abandoned and not disposed of under subsection
(b) shall be retained in storage for a minimum period of ten
(10) days after certified mail notice has been sent to the
owner and lienholders of record to permit reclamation of
the vehicle after payment of accrued charges. Such notice
shall set forth the year, make, model and serial number of
the abandoned motor vehicle, the place where the vehicle is
being held, and shall inform the owner and any lienholders
of their right to reclaim the vehicle. The notice shall state
that the failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their
rights to reclaim the vehicle under this section shall be
deemed a waiver of all right, title, and interest in the
vehicle and a consent to the sale of the vehicle.
(d) Disposal of vehicle. Each retained vehicle not
reclaimed by its owner or lienholder may be sold pursuant
to W.S.A. §342.40.
(e) Responsibility for costs of impoundment and
disposal. The owner of any abandoned vehicle, except a
stolen vehicle, is responsible for the abandonment and all
costs of impounding and disposing of the vehicle. Costs
not covered from the sale of the vehicle may be recovered
in a civil action by the City against the owner.
(f) Notice of sale or disposition. Within five (5) days
after the sale or disposal of a vehicle as provided in
subsection (d) of this section, the Police Chief shall advise

the division. A copy of such form shall also be given to the
purchaser of the vehicle.

prerecorded message to report any unlawful act, fire or
other emergency.
(Ord 119-06, §1, 1-1-07)
Sec. 12-127. False alarm fee.
(a) Any fees payable to the City which are delinquent
may be assessed against the property involved as a special
charge for current service, without notice, pursuant to
Wisconsin Statutes Annotated §66.0627.

more false alarms within a six- (6-) month
period the Police Department may suspend
response after the Chief of Police or designee
sends written notification to the alarm user. In
order to lift the suspension, the alarm user shall
submit written confirmation to the Chief of
Police or designee that the alarm system has
been inspected and repaired, if necessary,
and/or additional measures have been taken to
reduce the number of false alarms at that
location. If the Chief of Police or designee
determines that the actions taken are likely to
prevent the occurrence of additional false
alarms, the Police Department shall lift the
suspension.
(d) Exceptions and appeals.
(1) A fee shall not be charged if any of the
following apply:
a. The alarm was activated by criminal
activity or a legitimate emergency.
b. The alarm was activated after a power

ARTICLE VII. CHRONIC NUISANCE PREMISES.
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Sec. 12-140. Findings.
The Appleton Common Council finds that certain
premises within the City receive and require more than the
general, acceptable level of services from City departments.
These premises place an undue and inappropriate burden
on City of Appleton taxpayers. Nuisance activity
contributes to the general decay of an affected
neighborhood and negatively impacts law-abiding residents
in these neighborhoods. This ordinance is intended to
encourage responsible ownership of such properties such
that they do not unduly burden the City’s departments or
taxpayers. This ordinance provides a progressive
enforcement method to use when working with property
owners to abate nuisance activities. Therefore, the
Common Council determines that the City will charge the
owners of such premises with the costs associated with
abating nuisance activity at premises where nuisance
activities chronically occur. This section is not intended to
discourage crime victims or a person in legitimate need of
police services from requesting them. This section does not
affect a premises owner’s duty to comply with the Fair
Housing Laws, nor does it affect a premises owner’s duty to
comply with all other laws governing residential tenancies
which are contained in Chapter 704 of the Wisconsin
Statutes, Chapter ATCP 134 of the Wisconsin
Administrative Code and other parts of this code.

imposed by the provisions of this article and W.S.A.
§66.0627. The solid waste collection charge imposed by

shall pay in direct proportion to the service received.
(Ord 73-94, §1, 6-18-94)

ARTICLE IV. RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT
Sec. 16-100. Findings and purpose.
(a) In the exercise of its police powers, the City has
priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The
City desires to anticipate and minimize the number of
obstructions and excavations taking place in the public
rights-of-way to ensure that the rights-of-way remain
available for public services and safe for public use. The
taxpayers of the City bear the financial burden for the
upkeep of the rights-of-way and a primary cause for the
early and excess deterioration of the public rights-of-way is
the frequent excavation by Person who place facilities
therein.
The City finds that there has been an increase in the
use of the public rights-of-way and, as a result, increased
costs to the taxpayers of the City and that these costs are
likely to continue into the foreseeable future.
The City finds that excavation and occupancy of the
public rights-of-way causes direct and indirect costs to be
borne by the City and its taxpayers, including but not
limited to:
(1) Administrative costs associated with public
rights-of-way projects, such as registration,
permitting, inspection and supervision,
supplies and materials.
(2) Management costs associated with ongoing
management activities necessitated by public
right-of-way users.
(3) Repair costs to the roadway associated with
the actual excavation into the public right-ofway.
In response to the foregoing facts, the City hereby
enacts this ordinance relating to the administration and
permitting of excavation, obstruction and/or occupancy of
the public rights-of-way, together with an ordinance
making necessary revisions to other Code provisions. This
ordinance imposes reasonable regulations on the placement
and maintenance of facilities currently within in rights-ofway
or to be placed therein at some future time. It is
intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies and not conflict with regulations of those
agencies.
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide the City a
legal framework within which to regulate and manage the
public rights-of-way, and to provide for recovery of costs.
This ordinance provides for the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the City as they use the rights-of-way of
the City, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of the
public rights-of-way.
Under this chapter, all Persons who excavate, obstruct
and/or occupy the public rights-of-way will reimburse the
City’s administrative costs. Right-of-way users will bear a
fair share of the financial responsibility for the integrity of
the public rights-of-way.

Sec. 16-118. Supplementary applications.
(a) Limitations on area. An excavation permit is
valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the

other City, county, State, or Federal rules, laws or
regulations. A Permittee shall comply with all
requirements of local, state, and federal laws. A Permittee

the Municipal Services Committee. Following a hearing the
Municipal Services Committee may affirm, reverse or
modify the decision of the Department. The decision of the
Municipal Services Committee is final.
(d) Time limit to act and written denial. The City

protect the public safety as a result of the emergency, the
cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose
facilities occasioned the emergency.

ordinance, pay four times the normal fee for said permit,
pay double all other fees required by this chapter or other
chapters of the City Code, deposit with the Department the
fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way
and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. If
a subsequent permit is denied or is not approved, the
registrant shall discontinue and abandon its facilities and
the Department may cause any offending conditions to be
removed or corrected and the expense thereof charged to
the person responsible.
Sec. 16-122. Supplementary notification.
If the excavation of the right-of-way begins later or
ends sooner than the date given on the permit, the Permittee
shall notify the Department of the accurate information as
soon as this information is known.
Sec. 16-123. Location of facilities.
(a) Corridors. The Department may assign specific
corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment
thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is
or, pursuant to current technology, the City expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All
excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the City
involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall
designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue
consistent with the Department’s assignment.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-ofway
in a position at variance with the corridors established
by the City shall, no later than at the time of the next
reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities
are located, move the facilities to the assigned position
within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived
by the City for good cause shown, upon consideration of
such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities,
public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
(b) Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and
welfare, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and
its current use, the Department may prohibit or limit the
placement of new, replacement or additional facilities
within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to
accommodate all of the requests of Persons to occupy and
use the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the
Department/City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rightof-
way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of
the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of
year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of
existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future City plans
STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES

for public improvements and development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest.
Sec. 16-124. Relocation of facilities.
Except as prohibited by State or Federal law, a
registrant must promptly and at its own expense, with due
regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently
relocate its facilities in the right-of-way whenever the
Department requests such relocation, and shall restore the
right-of-way to the same condition it was in prior to said
relocation. The Department may make such request to
prevent interference by the Company’s facilities with (i) a
present or future City use of the right-of-way, (ii) a public
improvement undertaken by the City, (iii) when the public
health, safety and welfare require it, or (iv) when necessary
to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person shall not be
required to relocate its facilities from any right-of-way
which has been vacated in favor of a non-governmental
entity unless and until the reasonable costs thereof are first
paid to the person therefor.
Sec. 16-125. Interference with other facilities during
municipal construction.
When the City performs work in the right-of-way and
finds it necessary to maintain, support, shore, or move a
registrant’s facilities, the City shall notify the local
representative. The registrant shall meet with the City’s
representative within 24-hours and coordinate the
protection, maintenance, supporting, and/or shoring of the
registrant’s facilities. The registrant shall accomplish the
needed work within 72 hours, unless the City agrees to a
longer period. In the event that the registrant does not
proceed to maintain, support, shore, or move its facilities,
the City may arrange to do the work and bill the registrant
for costs it incurs as well as damages of $100 per day
beyond the registrant’s 72 hour deadline to accomplish the
needed work, said bill to be paid within thirty (30) days.
Sec. 16-126. Indemnification.
By registering with the City, or by accepting a permit
under this chapter, a registrant or Permittee, as the case
may be, agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
City, its officers, boards, committees, commissions, elected
officials, employees and agents (collective, “Indemnified
Parties”), from and against all loss or expense (including
liability costs and attorney’s fees) by reason of any claim or
suit, or of liability imposed by law upon an Indemnified
Party for damages because of bodily injury, including death
at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person or
persons or on account of damages to property, including
loss of use thereof, arising from, in connection with, caused
by or resulting from the permittee’s acts or omissions in the
exercise of its rights under this permit, whether caused by
or contributed to by the City or its agents or employees
except in such cases where caused by the sole negligence
or willful misconduct of the City.
Sec. 16-127. Abandoned facilities.
(a) Discontinued operations. A registrant who
discontinues its operations in the City must either:
(1) Provide information satisfactory to the
Department that the registrant’s obligations
for its facilities under this chapter have been
lawfully assumed by another registrant; or
(2) Submit to the Department a proposal and
instruments for dedication of its facilities to
the City. If a registrant proceeds under this
clause, the City may, at its option:
a. accept the dedication for all or a portion
of the facilities; or
b. require the registrant, at its own expense,
to remove the facilities in the right-ofway
at ground or aboveground; or
c. require the registrant to post a bond or
provide payment sufficient to reimburse
the City for reasonably anticipated costs
to be incurred in removing the facilities.
However, any registrant who has unusable and
abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove it
from the right-of-way within two years, unless the
Department waives this requirement.
(b) Abandoned facilities. Facilities of a registrant
who fails to comply with Sec. 16-127 subd (a), and which,
for two (2) years, remains unused shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned facilities may be deemed to be a
nuisance. In addition to any remedies or rights it has at law
or in equity, the City may, at its option (i) abate the
nuisance, (ii) take possession of the facilities, and/or (iii)
require removal of the facilities by the registrant, or the
registrant’s successor in interest.
(c) Public utilities. This section shall not apply to a
Public Utility that is required to follow the provisions of
Wis. Stat. § 196.81.
Sec. 16-128. Reservation of regulatory and police
powers.
The City, by granting of a permit to excavate, obstruct
and/or occupy the right-of-way, or by registering a person
APPLETON CODE
1064
Supp. #90
under this chapter does not surrender or to any extent lose,
waive, impair, or the lawful powers and rights, which it has
now or maybe hereafter granted to the City under the
Constitution and statutes of the State of Wisconsin to
regulate the use of the right-of-way by the Permittee; and
the Permittee by its acceptance of a permit to excavate,
obstruct and/or occupy the right-of-way or of registration
under this chapter agrees that all lawful powers an rights,
regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or
the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to
the City, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the
exercise thereof by the City at any time. A Permittee or
registrant is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are
subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to
adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the
safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to
comply with all applicable general law, and ordinances
enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
Sec. 16-129. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or
constitutional by any court or administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions thereof.
Editor’s Note: Article IV. was created by Ord. 23-17,
adopted on February 15, 2017 and becoming effective on
February 21, 2017.

(5) Indemnities. The permit holder, by accepting
a permit under this Chapter, agrees to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
City, its elected and appointed officials,
officers, employees, agents, representatives,
and volunteers (collectively, the
“Indemnified Parties”) from and against any
and all suits, actions, legal or administrative
proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
liabilities, interest, attorneys’ fees, costs, and
expenses of whatsoever kind or nature in any
manner caused in whole or in part, or claimed
to be caused in whole or in part, by reason of
any act, omission, fault, or negligence,
whether active or passive, of the permit
holder or anyone acting under its direction or
control or on its behalf, even if liability is
also sought to be imposed on one or more of
the Indemnified Parties. The obligation to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
Indemnified Parties shall be applicable even
if the liability results from an act or failure to
act on the part of one or more of the
Indemnified Parties. However, the obligation
does not apply if the liability results from the
willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party.
(6) Adverse Impacts on Adjacent Properties.
The permit holder shall undertake all
reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse
impacts to adjacent properties and/or uses
that may arise from the construction,
operation, maintenance, modification, or
removal of the facility.

contained in a written record.
(d) Appeal to Common Council. Any person
adversely affected by the decision of the Administrator may
appeal that decision to the Common Council, which may

in approval of the application by operation of
law.
(f) Decision Deadline. All appeals shall be
conducted so that a timely written decision may be issued
in accordance with the applicable shot clock.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Sec. 16-143. Expiration and Revocation.
(a) Expiration. A wireless permit issued pursuant to
an eligible facilities request shall expire at the same time
the permit for the underlying existing wireless
telecommunications facility expires. All other wireless

date of issuance. Upon expiration of the wireless permit,
the permit holder must either:
(1) Remove the wireless telecommunications
facility; or,
(2) Submit an application to renew the permit at
least 90 days prior to its expiration. The
facility must remain in place until the
renewal application is acted on by the City
and any appeals from the City’s decision are

permit holder.
(c) Failure to Obtain Permit. Unless exempted from
permitting by Sec. 16-137(b) of this Chapter, a wireless

restoration shall be paid by entities who own or control any
part of the wireless telecommunications facility.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Sec. 16-144. Relocation.
Except as otherwise prohibited by state or federal law,
a permit holder must promptly and at its own expense, with
due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently
remove and relocate any of its wireless telecommunications
facilities in the right-of-way whenever the City requests
such removal and relocation. The City may make such a
request to prevent the facility from interfering with a
present or future City use of the right-of-way; a public
improvement undertaken by the City; an economic
development project in which the City has an interest or
investment; when the public health, safety, or welfare
require it; or when necessary to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
right-of-way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a permit
holder shall not be required to remove or relocate its
facilities from any right-of-way that has been vacated in
favor of a non-governmental entity unless and until that
entity pays the reasonable costs of removal or relocation to
the permit holder.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Sec. 16-145. Abandonment.
(a) Cessation of Use. In the event that a permitted
facility within the right-of-way is not in use for a
continuous period of 60 days or longer, the permit holder
must promptly notify the City and do one of the following:
(1) Provide information satisfactory to the
Administrator that the permit holder’s
obligations for its facilities under this
Chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another permit holder.
APPLETON CODE
1072
Supp. #90
(2) Submit to the Administrator a proposal and
instruments for dedication of the facilities to
the City. If a permit holder proceeds under
this Sec. 16-145(a)(2), the City may, at its
option:
a. Accept the dedication for all or a portion
of the facilities;
b. Require the permit holder, at its own
expense, to remove the facilities and
perform the required restoration under
Sec. 16-146; or
c. Require the permit holder to post a bond
or provide payment sufficient to
reimburse the City for reasonably
anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities and undertaking
restoration under Sec. 16-146.
(3) Remove its facilities from the right-of-way
within one year and perform the required
restoration under Sec. 16-146, unless the
Administrator waives this requirement or
provides a later deadline.
(b) Abandoned Facilities. Facilities of a permit
holder who fails to comply with Sec. 16-145 and which, for
one year, remain unused shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. In
addition to any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity,
the City may, at its option:
(1) abate the nuisance and recover the cost from
the permit holder or the permit holder’s
successor in interest;
(2) take possession of the facilities; and/or
(3) require removal of the facilities by the permit
holder or the permit holder’s successor in
interest.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Sec. 16-146. Restoration.
In the event that a permit holder removes or is required
to remove a wireless telecommunications facility from the
right-of-way under this Chapter (or relocate it pursuant to
Sec. 16-144), the permit holder must restore the right-ofway
to its prior condition in accordance with City
specifications. However, a support structure owned by
another entity authorized to maintain that support structure
in the right-of-way need not be removed but must instead
be restored to its prior condition. If the permit holder fails
to make the restorations required by this Sec. 16-146, the
City at its option may do such work. In that event, the
permit holder shall pay to the City, within 30 days of
billing therefor, the cost of restoring the right-of-way.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Sec. 16-147. Placement on City-Owned or -Controlled
Structures.
The City may negotiate agreements for placement of
wireless telecommunications facilities on City-owned or -
controlled structures in the right-of-way. The agreement
shall specify the compensation to the City for use of the
structures. The person or entity seeking the agreement
shall reimburse the City for all costs the City incurs in
connection with its review of and action upon the request
for an agreement.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Sec. 16-148. Severability.
If any section, subsection, clause, phrase, or portion of
this Chapter is for any reason held to be illegal or otherwise
invalid by any court or administrative agency of competent
jurisdiction, such illegal or invalid portion shall be
severable and shall not affect or impair any remaining
portion of this Chapter, which shall remain in full force and
effect.
(Ord 41-19, §1, 4-3-19)
Secs. 16-149 – Sec. 16-150. Reserved.

All divisions of land Lot Line Adjustments, and Lot
Combinations shall conform to the comprehensive plan, the
Zoning Ordinance, the Official Map, this ordinance and all
other pertinent ordinances, regulations, resolutions or plans
which are adopted by the City.
(Code 1965, §21.11(1)(a), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-24. Compliance with State standards.
All subdivisions shall conform to:
(1) The provisions of Chapter 236 Wisconsin
State Statutes, except that this ordinance shall
prevail where it imposes higher standards.
(2) The rules of the Division of Highways,
Wisconsin Department of Transportation
contained in Wis. Adm. Code Chapter Trans
233 relating to safety of access and the
preservation of the public interest and
investment in the streets if the subdivision or
any lot contained therein abuts on a state
trunk highway or connecting street.
(Code 1965, §21.11(1)(b), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-25. Streets.
(a) General considerations. Streets shall be designed
and located in relation to:
(1) Existing and planned streets.
(2) Topographic considerations, drainage and
other natural features, to produce usable lots
and streets of reasonable gradient.
(3) The public convenience and safety.
(4) The future circulation needs of nearby lands.
(5) The proposed uses of land to be served.
(b) Streets to conform to city plans. Street layouts,
widths, grades and locations shall conform to the official
map and the City of Appleton’s Comprehensive Plan and
Arterial Plan.
(c) Arrangement.
(1) Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be
arranged so as to provide ready access to
centers of employment, centers of
governmental activity, community retail
areas, community recreation and points
beyond the boundaries of the community.
They shall also be properly integrated with
and related to the existing and proposed
system of arterial streets and highways and
shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous
and in alignment with existing or planned
streets with which they are to connect.
(2) Collector streets. Collector streets shall be
arranged so as to provide ready collection of
traffic from residential areas and conveyance
of this traffic to the arterial street and
highway system and shall be properly related
to the multimodal transportation system, to
special traffic generators such as schools,
churches and retail centers and other
concentrations of population and to the major
streets to which they connect.
(3) Local streets. Local streets shall be arranged
to conform to the topography, to discourage
use by through traffic, to permit the design of
efficient storm and sanitary sewerage
systems, and to require the minimum street
area necessary to provide for safe and
convenient access to abutting property.
(4) Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision
borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the
Council may require a marginal access street,
approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for
the appropriate use of the intervening land.
(d) Width. The right-of-way of all streets shall be of
the width specified on the Official Map or Comprehensive
Plan, or if no width is specified there, they shall be not less
than the width specified in the following table:
Type
Right-of-Way
(feet)
Arterial 80 – 100

(e) Street names. New streets names shall not
duplicate in fact or sound substantially similar to the names
of existing streets in the City or its extraterritorial
jurisdiction, but streets that are continuations of others
already in existence and named shall bear the name of the
existing street, except if the continuation changes alignment
approximating ninety (90) degrees from its original
direction, then a new name may be required by the
Common Council after recommendation by the Plan
Commission.
(f) Dead-end streets where permitted shall be
designed in accordance with the Municipal Fire Prevention
and Protection Code.
(g) Cul-de-sacs. Streets designed to have one (1) end
permanently closed shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet
in length from centerline of intersecting street to center of
turnaround and shall terminate with a turnaround of not less
than one hundred and ten (110) feet in diameter of right-ofway
and a roadway turnaround of ninety (90) feet in
diameter. The Public Works Director may waive this
requirement where it is unnecessary to fulfill the purposes
and intent of this ordinance and undo hardship would result
from strict application thereof. A temporary cul-de-sac
may be placed at the end of a street that will be extended:
provision shall be made for reversion of the excess
turnaround right-of-way to the adjoining properties when
the street is extended
(h) Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to
streets shall be prohibited except where their control is
definitely placed with the City under conditions approved
by the Common Council.

(1) Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. Not more than two (2) streets
shall intersect at one (1) point unless
approved by the Common Council after
recommendation by the Plan Commission.
(2) Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
one hundred twenty-five (125) feet are
prohibited. Where streets intersect arterials,
their alignment shall be continuous, except
the Director of Public Works or his or her
designee may waive this requirement.
(k) Dead-end and “T” alleys. Are prohibited.
(l) Special streets. Where parkways or special types
of streets are involved, the Common Council may apply
special standards to be followed in their design.
(m) Marginal access streets. Where a marginal access
street has been provided, the Common Council may require
that such a street be located at a distance from the major
street or easement suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land for:
(1) Park purposes.
(2) Motor vehicle parking, business or industry,
in appropriate zones.
(3) Other provisions for the adequate protection
of residential properties and the separation of
through and local traffic. Such distances shall

SUBDIVISIONS
1135
Supp. #76
(1) All lots shall abut on a public street or an
approved access.
(2) Double frontage lots shall not be permitted
except as required by the Common Council
where they are desirable to provide
separation of development from traffic
arterials or inharmonious uses, or to
overcome disadvantages of topography or
situation. A planting screen easement of at
least twenty (20) feet, and across which there
shall be no right of access, may be required
along the line of lots abutting such traffic
arteries or other inharmonious use.
(d) Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be at right
angles or radial to the street line or substantially so. Along
curvilinear streets, side lot lines so formed shall form a lot
having not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width at the
curbline.
(e) Residential lots backing on arterials. Residential
lots backing on Highway 41, Highway 441 and other
arterial streets as determined by the City shall be platted
with extra depth to permit generous distance between
buildings and such traffic ways, such lot depth being a
minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet. In addition,
residential lots backing on Highway 41 and Highway 441
shall be platted with either an earthen berm or soundproof
fence, acceptable to the City in height and materials, and
shall be in place prior to home construction.
(f) Corner lots. Corner lots shall have sufficient
width to provide usable rear yards as well as to permit full
building setbacks from all streets as set forth in the Zoning
Ordinance or other regulations.
(g) Proportions. Excessive lot depth in relation to
width shall be avoided. A proportion of two (2) length to
one (1) width shall normally be considered a desirable
maximum for lot widths of sixty (60) feet or more.
(h) Lots to follow municipal boundaries. Lots shall
follow municipal boundaries whenever practicable, rather
than cross them.
(i) Land suitability. No land shall be subdivided for
residential, commercial, or industrial use which is
determined to be unsuitable for the proposed use by the
Plan Commission or Common Council for reasons of
flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock
formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature
likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the
future residents of the proposed subdivision, minor land
division or of the municipality. In addition:
(1) Floodlands. Subdivided lots shall have at
least fifty percent (50%) of the minimum
required lot area, based upon the respective
zoning district, at least two (2) feet above the
elevation of the one hundred (100) year
reoccurrence interval flood.
(2) Subdivided lots shall have at least fifty
percent (50%) of the minimum required lot
area, based upon the respective zoning
district, in slopes of less than twelve percent
(12%). Lands having a slope of twenty
percent (20%) or greater shall be maintained
in permanent open space use, unless the
following items are submitted to the City of
Appleton Public Works Department for
review and approval prior to the issuance of a
building permit: The application for a
building permit shall be accompanied by a
Drainage and Grading Plan, an Erosion
Control Plan, a Plot Plan, and a Building
Foundation Design Plan prepared by a
licensed professional civil engineer or
structural engineer registered in the State of
Wisconsin, trained and experienced in the
practice of geotechnical engineering. The
engineer shall provide the design and
supervision such that, in the engineer’s
opinion, the development does not and will
not compromise in any way the stability of
the soil on site or soil on lands which are
adjacent, and will not cause or contribute to
such soils becoming susceptible to land slip,
land slide, rock fall, mud flow, debris flow,
erosion, slumping, settling or other such
occurrence.
a. Any subdivided lot containing slopes of
twenty percent (20%) or greater shall be
identified on the face of the Final Plat or
Certified Survey Map as being subject to
the requirements and restrictions
described above.
(3) Lands made, altered or filled with non-earth
materials within the preceding twenty (20)
years shall not be divided into building sites
which are to be served by soil absorption
sewage disposal systems.
(4) Lands made, altered or filled with earth
within the preceding seven (7) years shall not
be divided into building sites which are to be

Supp. #76
served by on-site soil absorption sewage
disposal systems.
(5) Reserve strips may not be created by any
division of land.
(6) Lands having bedrock within six (6) feet of
the natural undisturbed surface shall not be
divided into building sites to be served by
on-site soil absorption sewage disposal
systems.
(7) Lands having groundwater within six (6) feet
of the natural undisturbed surface shall not be
divided into building sites to be served by
soil absorption sewage disposal systems.
Lands drained by farm drainage tile or farm
ditch systems shall not be divided into
building sites to be served by on-site soil
absorption sewage disposal systems.
(8) The Plan Commission, in applying the
provisions of this section, shall in writing
recite the particular facts upon which it bases
its conclusion that the land is not suitable for
residential, commercial, industrial, or
institutional use and afford the subdivider an
opportunity to present evidence regarding
such unsuitability if he or she so desires.
Thereafter, the Plan Commission may affirm,
modify, or withdraw its determination of
unsuitability.
(j) Existing flora. The subdivider shall make every
effort to protect and retain all healthy trees within a
subdivision, minor land division, or lot line adjustment to
the mutual agreement of the City and Developer. The City
Forester shall review the conditions of the trees. Any trees
identified for protection and preservation during
construction shall be done so in accordance with sound
conservation practices, possibly including the preservation
of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever
abutting grades are altered.

200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord 140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-27. Easements.
(a) Easements shall be provided for any surface,
underground or overhead utility service, including
stormwater drainage, where required by the Common
Council. Such easements shall be at least of sufficient
width to accommodate the installation and future
maintenance of the facility and shall be located to provide
continuity of alignment throughout the area served.
(b) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and such
further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate
for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that
drainage be maintained by an open channel with
landscaped banks. Open channels shall include an additional
area of at least fifteen (15) feet wide adjoining both
edges of the established floodplain.
(Code 1965, §21.11(5), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-28. Drainage ways.
(a) The subdivider shall make provisions for surface
water runoff as required on the drainage plan by cutting and
filling the drainage ways to the grades, elevations and
widths as set forth on the plan. The drainage ways shall be
protected from erosion by seeding and mulching and other
additional erosion control steps that may be required by this
ordinance. The drainage plan shall be deemed to be a
covenant running with the land. No person shall alter,
change or modify the approved drainage plan by regrading,
construction or otherwise, without the prior written
approval of the City Engineer. Such approval shall be
conditioned upon the provision of suitable drainage
alternatives.
(b) The obstruction of drainage flow at either primary
drainage swales or along the lot line drainage is prohibited.

ARTICLE V. DEDICATIONS AND
RESERVATIONS
Sec. 17-29. Dedication of public sites and open spaces.
In order that adequate open spaces and sites for public
uses may be properly located and preserved as the
community develops, and in order that the cost of providing
park and recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve
the additional families brought into the community by
subdivision development may be most equitably
apportioned on the basis of the additional need created by
the individual subdivision or minor land division
development, the following provisions are established:
(a) Reservation of potential sites. In the design of the
subdivision or minor land division, consideration shall be
given to the adequate provision of and correlation with
such public sites or open areas. Where it is determined by
the Plan Commission that a portion of that subdivision or
minor land division is required for such public sites or open
spaces, the subdivider may be required to reserve such area
for a period not to exceed three (3) years, after which the
City shall either acquire the property or release the
reservation.
(b) Dedication of sites.
(1) Within the corporate limits of the City, the
subdivider shall provide and dedicate to the
public either a minimum of five (5) acres of
land to provide for park and recreation needs
of the community as required by the adopted
comprehensive plan or as determined by the
Plan Commission in conjunction with the
subdivider and in an amount of land to be
determined in accordance with the zoning
classification intended for each lot in the
subdivision as specified in the following
table:
Types of Dwelling Units
and Zones
Percent Allocation
of Total Gross
Residential Acreage
R-1A zone, one-family 5
R-1B and R-1C zone, one-family 6
R-2 zone, two-family 8
R-3 zone, apartment 12
PD (Planned Development
Overlay – Residential)
12
(2) Where such dedication is not feasible or is
not compatible with the comprehensive plan,
the subdivider shall in lieu thereof pay to the
City a fee according to the zoning
classification intended for each lot in the
subdivision as specified in the following
table:
Types of Dwelling Units
and Zones
In Lieu of Payment
(per unit)
R-1A zone, one-family $300.00
R-1B zone, one-family $300.00
R-1C zone, one-family $300.00
R-2 zone, two-family $200.00
R-3 zone, apartment $150.00
PD (Planned Development
Overlay – Residential)
$150.00
(3) Such fees shall be held in a nonlapsing fund
to be used exclusively for immediate or
future site acquisition or capital
improvement.
(c) Proportionate payment in lieu of dedication.
Where such dedication is not feasible or compatible with
the comprehensive plan, the subdivider shall, in lieu
thereof, pay to the City a fee equivalent to the value of the
required dedication. Such fee should be distributed and
paid as follows:
(1) No payment shall be required for a lot created
by the subdivision of land under this
ordinance on which a residential structure
already exists, or which is a residential parcel
in excess of one hundred twenty (120) acres
and not intended for immediate sale or other
conveyance.
(2) The required payment shall be made before
the certification of approval may be affixed
to the Final Plat.
(3) After the Final Plat has been recorded, no lot
or parcel may be further divided by replat, or
conveyance as defined in W.S.A. §706.01(3),
and no building permit may be issued, unless:
a. Such further division has been approved
by the Plan Commission as being in
accordance with the purpose of this
ordinance and with the purposes of
W.S.A. Chapter 236;
b. Payment of the fee as specified in §17-
28(3) shall be made for each additional
lot or parcel created by the division; and
c. The proportionate payment in lieu of
dedication as set forth in this section
APPLETON CODE
1138
Supp. #76
shall be paid for all certified survey
maps, and the Register of Deeds of the
county in which the land is located shall
not accept a certified survey map for
record unless the map has been approved
by the Common Council.
(d) Determination of feasibility. The determination
as to the feasibility of dedication shall be made by the City
Plan Commission.
(Code 1965, §21.13(1)(c); Ord 55-94, §1, 4-20-94; Ord 67-
94, §1, 6-18-94, Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord 140-06, §1,

140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-31. Reservation of road widths.
Road widths in excess of the minimum primary arterial
rights-of-way established in this ordinance are required to
be reserved.
(Code 1965, §21.13(2)(a), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-32. Reservation of public sites.
Where sites for parks, schools, playgrounds or other
public uses except streets, as shown in the comprehensive
plan, are located within the subdivision area, the Common
Council shall require that the sites be reserved by the
subdivider for a period of two (2) years from the date of
approval of the Final Plat. If the government agency
concerned passes a resolution expressing its intent to
acquire the land so reserved, the reservation period shall be
extended for an additional six (6) months. Public
reservations shall be clearly identified on the plat; e.g.,
“Reserved for Public School Site”. The Council may by
resolution waive any reservation so required.
(Code 1965, §21.13(2)(b), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-33. Private reservations.
Reservation of areas for the exclusive use of the
occupants of a subdivision may be permitted by the
Common Council when such reservations will not be
contrary to the public health, safety, morals or general
welfare, and such areas shall be clearly identified on the
preliminary and final plats as private reservations.
(Code 1965, §21.13(2)(c), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-34. Right of refusal.
The number, size and location of all dedications,
reservations or easements shall be subject to approval, and
the Common Council shall ascertain that the proposed sites
are suitable for the proposed uses. The Council retains the
right to refuse any dedication.
(Code 1965, §21.13(3), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)
Sec. 17-35. Accomplishment of dedication.
When a final plat of a subdivision located in the City
has been approved by the Common Council and all other
required approvals are obtained and the plat is recorded,
that approval constitutes acceptance for the purpose
designated on the plat of all lands shown in the plat as
dedicated to the public, including street dedications.
(Code 1965, §21.13(4), Ord 200-01, §1, 12-24-01, Ord
140-06, §1, 12-26-06)

ARTICLE IV. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS*
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Sec. 18-101. Levy and collection procedure.
The City, in levying and collecting special assessments
for the construction and installation of public improvements
in the City, shall proceed in the following manner:
(1) Whenever the Common Council shall deem it
necessary in the best interest of the City to
construct or cause to be constructed any such
improvements, all or part of the cost of which is
to be assessed against the property benefited, it
shall adopt a preliminary resolution declaring
its intention to exercise its power of assessment
for such stated purpose. Such resolution shall
contain the information required by W.S.A.
§66.0703(4).
(2) Any and all persons who appear at the hearing
shall be heard for or against the contemplated
improvements and assessments.
(3) After the hearing upon any proposed work or
improvement, the Common Council may
approve, disapprove or modify the report or it
may refer the report back to the Finance
Committee with such directions as it deems
necessary to accomplish a fair and equitable
assessment.
(4) When the Common Council finally determines
to proceed with the work or improvement, it
shall by resolution direct the Finance
Committee to proceed with such work or
improvements, in accordance with the report as
finally approved, and direct the Director of
Public Works to determine the assessments.
The City Clerk shall publish and mail the final
resolution as provided for therein shall be
deemed legally authorized and the assessments
so provided shall be deemed duly and legally
made, subject to the right of appeal provided for
in W.S.A. §66.0701(2).
(5) Whenever the actual cost of any project shall,
upon completion or after the receipt of bids, be
found to vary materially from the estimates or
whenever any assessment is void or invalid for
any reason, or whenever the Common Council
shall determine to reconsider and reopen any
assessment, it shall do so only after first giving
notice as provided in W.S.A. §66.0703(8)(d).
(6) If the cost of the project is less than the special
assessment levied by the Common Council,
without notice or hearing, shall reduce such
special assessment proportionately, and when
any assessments or installments thereof have
been paid, the excess over cost shall be applied
to reduce succeeding unpaid installments,
where the property owner is paying in
installments, or refunded to the property owner.
(7) Except as otherwise provided in this section,
the special assessments may be paid in annual
installments as provided in the special
assessment policy. The first installment, if not
sooner paid, shall be placed by the Director of
Finance as a special charge in the first tax roll
prepared after completion of the work, and one
(1) of the subsequent installments shall be so
placed in each of the annual tax rolls thereafter
until all are levied. The first installment shall
be due at the time the general property taxes are
due, and the subsequent installments shall be
due thereafter together with one (1) year’s
interest at the rate set in the Special Assessment
Policy per annum on the unpaid balance.
Installments of assessments not paid when due
shall be returned to the county as delinquent the
same as delinquent taxes. Payment in full may
be made at any time, but the property owner
shall pay accrued interest, if any, on such
payment, to the date of payment.
(8) Assessments in the amount less than that set
annually by the Common Council in the
assessment policy shall not be paid on the
installment basis, and the Director of Finance
shall place the assessment, as a special tax, in
the first tax roll prepared after the publication
of the final resolution of Common Council
establishing the assessments.
(9) Property owners may submit waivers pursuant
to W.S.A. §66.0703(7)(b), and if the owners of
all of the property to be specially benefited by
such work or improvement submit such waiver
the Common Council may make the assessment
without notice and hearing.

Any temporary signs posted by authorized agencies

(Code 1965, §10.19(2); Ord 100-12, §1, 10-23-12)
Sec. 19-7. Traffic regulations during disaster
emergencies; emergency routes.
(a) A disaster emergency is hereby declared to exist
requiring a special regulation of vehicular traffic and
parking, whenever there shall be declared by the
authorities responsible for so doing either a disaster
emergency alert, whether strategic or tactical, or a disaster
emergency test exercise, necessitating the evacuation of
persons from the City in order to properly provide for the
public safety under such conditions. Such emergency is
declared for a period of twenty-four (24) hours after the
announcement of any strategic alert, for an indefinite
period until revoked by proclamation of the Mayor or
resolution of the Common Council after any tactical alert,
and for a period commencing two (2) hours before and
extending until four (4) hours after the conclusion of any
announced test exercise.
(b) The disaster emergency escape routes to which the
provisions of this section shall apply are those designated on
such disaster emergency escape route plan of the City as
may from time to time be adopted by the Common Council
and as on file in the office of the Traffic Engineer.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
chapter, whenever a disaster emergency shall exist, the
following traffic regulations shall apply:
(1) All lanes of each street or highway designated
as a disaster emergency escape route,
including those divided by a center strip, shall
be restricted to one- (1-) way traffic moving in
a direction from the center of the city toward
its outer limits. No person shall operate any
vehicle thereon in the opposite direction.
(2) No operator of any vehicle shall cross any
disaster emergency escape route.
(3) No operator of any vehicle shall enter any
disaster emergency escape route at any point
except a point where entry is authorized on the
escape route plan.
(4) No person shall park any vehicle or permit any
vehicle to remain standing on any disaster
emergency escape route.
(5) Because of the necessity for keeping all lanes
of traffic open for the movement of vehicles
under a disaster emergency, whenever any
traffic officer shall find a vehicle parked or in
any other way blocking the free movement of
traffic over any disaster emergency escape
route, he is authorized to move or direct the
removal of such vehicle to a position off the
escape route.
The Chief of Police is hereby authorized to promulgate
appropriate detailed orders relative to control or
immobilization of traffic during a disaster emergency, and
upon the filing thereof with the City Clerk such requirements
shall be a part of this section, of the same force and effect,
and the penalties prescribed in this chapter shall apply to any
violations of such orders.

more than ten (10) minutes at any time, except the

have been trimmed to a height of ten (10) feet
above the ground, located in the terrace of
any street within sixty (60) feet of the crossstreet
right-of-way in the approach direction
and thirty (30) feet from the cross-street
right-of-way in the nonapproach direction of

(2) The property owner or the person in
possession of property abutting any street in

(10) feet above the ground. Such bushes,
shrubs, weeds or other vegetation, if not so
removed, shall be removed by the City
without notice and the expense thereof
reported to the City Clerk, who shall enter the

the benefited property.
(b) Vegetation or structures on private property.
(1) No owner or occupant of any property
abutting a public street shall permit any trees,
shrubs, bushes, weeds, signs, structures, wall
or fences on his property to be so placed and
maintained as to obstruct the vision of a user
of the street at its intersection with another
street or public thoroughfare. There shall be a
vision corner on all corner lots located in
zoning districts that require a minimum
twenty- (20-) foot setback from street property
lines. The vision corner is described as the
triangular area enclosed by a straight line
connecting a point on each street right-of-way
line, which point is twenty-five (25) feet from
the intersection of the right-of-way lines.
Fences, walls, signs or structures erected in
such vision corners shall not exceed three (3)
feet in height. The fence, wall, sign or
structure shall be a minimum of two-thirds
(2/3) open to vision, equally distributed
throughout the fence length and height located
within the defined vision corner. Plantings in
such vision corners shall be maintained in
such a fashion as to provide unobstructed
vision from three (3) feet above the centerline
elevation of the abutting pavement to ten (10)
feet above the centerline elevation.
(2) The provisions of subsection (b)(1) of this
section shall also apply to those corner lots
located in zoning districts that require a ten-
(10-) foot setback from street property lines,
except in those cases the vision corner is
described as the triangular area enclosed by a
straight line connecting a point on each street
right-of-way line, which point is twenty (20)
feet from the intersection of the street right-ofway.

(c) Inspections. In accordance with the Cross
Connection Prevention Policy and its inspection
requirements for different types of properties, it shall be the
duty of the City Water Utility to inspect, to cause
inspections to be made or require the submission of
inspections reports from all properties serviced by the
public water system where cross connection with the public
water system is deemed possible. The frequency of
inspections and reinspection, based on potential health
hazards involved, shall be as established by the City Water
Utility and as approved by the State Department of Natural
Resources. Upon inspection, if a potential cross connection
involving a health hazard exists, the City Water Utility’s
inspector or authorized representative may order that an
approved cross connection control device be installed for
containment from the public water system.
(d) Right of entry. Upon presentation of credentials,
the representative of the Water Utility shall have the right
to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any
property served by a connection to the public water system
of the City for cross connections. If entry is refused, such
representative shall obtain a special inspection warrant
under W.S.A. §66.0119. On request, the owner, lessee or
occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the
inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the
piping system on such property.
(e) Authority to discontinue service. The Water
Utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue
water service to any property wherein any connection in
violation of this section exists, and to take such other
precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any
danger of contamination of the public water system. Water
service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice
and opportunity for hearing under W.S.A. Chapter 68,
except as provided in subsection (f) of this section. Water
service to such property shall not be restored until the cross

connection has been eliminated in compliance with the
provisions of this section.
(f) Emergency discontinuance of service. If it is
determined by the Water Utility that a cross connection or
an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare
and required immediate action, and a written finding to that
effect is filed with the City Clerk and delivered to the
customer’s premises, service may be immediately
discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for
hearing under W.S.A. Chapter 68, within ten (10) days of
such emergency discontinuance.

of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more
than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall
contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged
during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications
must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under §20-145 of
this article. The notification requirement in this section
does not apply to pollutants already reported by users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the selfmonitoring

discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous
wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous
wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent
months during which the user discharges more than such
quantifies of any hazardous wastes do not require
additional notification.
(c) In case of any new regulations under Section 3001
of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste, the user must notify the Director of
Utilities, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, the State Hazardous Waste Authorities
of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days
of the effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this
section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place
to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge
any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by

the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user
come into compliance with a specified time. If the user
does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discounted unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also
may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for
a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Sec. 20-202. Imposed.
It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary
for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the
public to allocate all of the cost of collection and treatment
of sewage and use of the sewage system of the City to the
property served. The cost of such service shall be imposed
on the property served as a special charge for current
serviced rendered and shall be known as sewer service
charges and such charges are hereby imposed by the
provisions of this article and W.S.A. §66.0627. For
purposes of this article, sewage system shall include
without limitation all facilities within or without the City
for the collection, transportation, pumping, treatment and
disposition of sewage and water-carried wastes created in
and to be conducted away from residential, commercial and
industrial establishments and public, private and charitable
buildings of all kinds. The sewer service charge imposed
by this article shall apply equally to all users of the sewer
system and shall be such that each user shall pay in direct
proportion to the service received. The sewer service
charge shall take precedence over any other existing
agreements.
(Code 1965, §2.11(1); Ord 59-94, §1, 5-4-94)
Sec. 20-203. Basis.
The sewer service charges imposed by this article shall
be based on either one of the following:
(1) The water meter readings of the City Department
of Utilities Water Division, plus the water used by
each industry or other user form of all other
sources such as wells, rivers and the like.
Measurement of any such additional water other
than water division meter readings, shall be by
meter, weir or other measuring device approved
UTILITIES
1343
Supp. #89
by the Utilities Manager and installed by the
industry or user at his own expense.
(2) The quantity and quality of sewage discharged
into the sewage system. The quantity of sewage
shall be measured by meter, weir or other
measuring device approved by the Utilities
Manager and installed by the industry or user at
its own expense. The quality of sewage shall be
measured by the pounds of suspended solids and
the pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
contained therein. The determination of
suspended solids and BOD contained in the waste
shall be in accordance with guidelines approved
by the EPA and DNR establishing test procedures
for the analysis of pollutants. To determine the
quality of the sewage and waste, samplings and
analyses of twenty-four (24) composite samples
shall be made daily by and at the expense of the
industry or user and accumulated over the billing
period. The City shall have the right to access all
measurement and analytical facilities and shall
cause sufficient tests to be made to establish the
validity of the information being supplied.
The selection of either alternative basis of charges as set
out in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be made
upon the direction of the Utilities Manager.
(Code 1965, §2.11(2); Ord 59-94, §1, 5-4-94)
Sec. 20-204. Rates.
(a) The sewer service charges imposed by this article
shall be based upon the rates adopted by the Common
Council. The rates shall be reviewed at least once annually
and shall be such that they produce sufficient revenue to
meet all costs budgeted for their effective time period. The
users of the sewer service shall be notified annually of the
portion of user charges attributable to wastewater treatment
services. Said rates shall be on file in the Office of the City
Clerk.
(b) The City shall determine the strength of normal
domestic waste from its non-monitored customers by
subtracting the industrial monitored loading by parameter
from the total loading treated by the City. The net pounds
of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended
solids from the non-monitored customers shall be divided
by 8.34 (a conversion factor) and then divided by the net
billable flow (expressed in millions of gallons) from those
non-monitored customers to determine whether the strength
of the waste is within a reasonable range for a normal
domestic household. The City will consider normal
domestic strength waste to have a BOD concentration of
not more than three hundred (300) milligrams per liter.
Should this calculation for BOD be higher than three
hundred (300) milligrams per liter, a review will be done of
the city users to determine if there are additional users that
should be monitored for high strength water. This
methodology shall be followed to assure that the charges
are proportionately made to all customers. No users shall
pay less per one thousand (1,000) gallons than the current
effective rate associated with the per unit costs for
environmental treatment based on the waste characteristics
determined to be applicable for domestic or industrial users.

In cases where there is no water meter or acceptable
water consumption record the quantity of water used shall
be determined in such reasonable and accurate manner as
the Utilities Manager may direct and the charge shall be
computed. If any building discharging sanitary sewage,
industrial wastes, water and other liquid, directly or
indirectly, into the public sanitary sewerage system can
show to the satisfaction of the Utilities Manager that a
portion of the water used does not and cannot enter the
public sanitary sewage system, the City may determine by a
reasonable and accurate method, the amount of the water
used or the percentage of water entering the public sanitary
sewage system chargeable to such owner or user. Such
amount or percentage, when so determined, shall then
constitute the basis of sewer service charges. Any
additional meter required to determine the quantity of water
actually entering the sewage system shall be installed at the
expense of the owner or other interested party.

authorized as the collection agency for the City and the
industrial monitoring and sewer service charges shall be
collected quarterly at the same time as water payments
become due. Bills shall be prepared by the Department of
Finance and sent to the owner or occupant of each premises
served by a public sanitary sewer. If partial payment is
made on any bill, the payment shall apply equally to the
water and sewer portions of the bill. The Department of
Finance shall allocate the actual cost of billing and
collecting.
(b) The bills for water, industrial monitoring and
sanitary sewer charges shall be mailed to the designated
utility bill recipient, but this mailing shall not relieve the
owner of the property from liability for rental property in
the event payment is not made as required in this article.
The owner of any property served which is occupied by
tenants shall have the right to examine collection records of

period of twenty (20) days from the date of utility bill, such
bill shall become a delinquent special charge and shall
become a lien as provided in W.S.A. §66.0703(15). Said
charges shall automatically be extended upon the current or
next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property; and all
proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of
property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such
special charges. Unpaid charges shall be assessed a one

ARTICLE V. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
SERVICES
DIVISION 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 20-226. Findings and necessity.
The City of Appleton finds that the management of
stormwater and other surface water discharge within and
beyond the Fox River is a matter that affects the health,
safety and welfare of the City, its citizens and businesses
and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively
manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility
operations of the City by, among other things, increasing
the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the sanitary
sewer. In addition, surface water runoff may create erosion
of lands, threaten businesses and residences with water
damage and create sedimentation and other environmental
damage in the Fox River. Those elements of the system
which provide for the collection of and disposal of
stormwater and regulation of groundwater are of benefit
and provide services to all property within the City of
Appleton, including property not presently served by the
storm elements of the system. The cost of operating and
maintaining the City stormwater management system and
financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements
and extension thereof should, to the extent practicable, be
allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and
services received therefrom. In order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public, the Common Council is
exercising its authority to establish a stormwater utility and
set the rates for stormwater management services. The City
is acting under the authority of Chapters 62 and 66 of the
Wisconsin Statutes, and particularly at least the following
statutes: §62.04, §62.11, §62.16(2), §62.18, §66.0621,
§66.0809 and §66.0821.
Sec. 20-227. Establishment.
There is hereby established a City of Appleton
Stormwater Utility. The operation of the Stormwater
Utility shall be under the supervision of the Common
Council. The Director of Public Works will be in charge of
the Stormwater Utility.
Sec. 20-228. Authority.
The City, through the Stormwater Utility, may acquire,
construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand,
replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance
such facilities as are deemed by the City to be proper and
reasonably necessary for a system of storm and surface
water management. These facilities may include, without
limitation by enumeration, surface and underground
drainage facilities, sewers, watercourses, retaining walls
and ponds and such other facilities as will support a
stormwater management system.

DIVISION 2. RATES AND CHARGES
Sec. 20-236. Rate charges.
(a) By this ordinance, the Common Council is
establishing the rate charge upon each lot and parcel within
the City of Appleton for services and facilities provided by
the Stormwater Utility. The actual charges to be imposed,
the establishment of formulas for calculations of the
charges, the establishment of specific customer
classifications and any future changes in those rates,
formulas, rate charges, and customer classifications, may
be made by resolution. All rates established pursuant to
this ordinance will be fair and reasonable. The current
rates will be on file with the City Clerk.
(b) Rate charges shall be issued to share the costs of
the Stormwater Utility. These rate charges may include:
(1) Base Charge (BC) – The base charge may be
imposed on all property in the city. The base
charge will be designed to reflect the fact that
all properties benefit from the stormwater
management activities of the City and that all
property contribute in some way to the
stormwater discharge that must be managed
by the City. The BC will be designed to
collect the administrative costs of the storm
sewer utility and the portion of capital costs
not covered by special assessments. The BC
may be based on the size of a parcel of
property.
(2) Equivalent Runoff Unit Charge (ERU) –
This charge may be imposed on all property
that has any developed impervious area. The
ERU will be designed on the basis of a
typical residential unit of property. Other
units of property will be charged multiples of
the ERU based on the impervious area
contributing to surface water runoff.
(3) Special Charge (SC) – This charge may be
imposed on property that is in an area
specially benefited by a particular stormwater
management facility. The SC will be
developed to reflect the benefits/services in a
particular area that may not be appropriate to
spread to property throughout the City. The
SC will be calculated on an ERU basis.
(c) The Council may make such other and customer
classifications as will be likely to provide reasonable and
fair distribution of the costs of the Stormwater Utility. In
so doing, the Council may provide credits against certain of
the charges set forth above for facilities installed and
maintained by the property owner for the purpose of
lessening the stormwater flow from that given property.
(d) The City Department of Finance is hereby
appointed as the collection agency for the City Stormwater
Utility. Bills shall be prepared by the Department of
Finance and sent to the owner or occupant of each premise
served. The Department of Finance shall allocate the actual
cost of billing and collecting.
(e) The bills for Stormwater Utility charges shall be
mailed to the designated utility bill recipient, but this
mailing shall not relieve the owner of the property from
liability for rental property in the event payment is not
made as required in this article. The owner of any property
served which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to
examine collection records of the City for the purpose of
determining whether such rates and charges have been paid
for such tenants, provided that such examination shall be
made at the office at which the records are kept and during
the hours that such office is open for business.
(f) Stormwater Utility charges shall not be payable in
installments. If Stormwater Utility charges remain unpaid
after a period of twenty (20) days from the date of utility
bill, such bill shall become a delinquent special charge and
shall become a lien as provided in W.S.A. §66.66(15).
Said charges shall automatically be extended upon the
current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the
property, and all proceedings in relation to the collection,
return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes
shall apply to such special charges. Unpaid charges shall
be assessed a one and one-half percent (1½%) per month
late payment charge to bills not paid within twenty (20)
days of issuance.
(g) All delinquent special charges shall be subject to a
ten percent (10%) penalty in addition to all other charges
and prior penalties or interest when the delinquent special
charge is extended upon the tax roll.
Sec. 20-237. Customer classification.

Sec. 20-238. New construction.
(a) The property owner shall be responsible for
completing the stormwater utility service application form
any time a building permit is issued, exclusive of those
issued to existing single family residences, or a site plan
review is conducted. The form shall be provided by the
Division of Inspections with each application for a building
permit (exclusive of building permits for single family
residences) or application for site plan review. Failure to
submit a completed stormwater utility service application
form or providing false information on said form, shall
result in the penalty as provided in §1-18 of the Municipal
Code.
(Ord 129-95, §1, 12-9-95; Ord 132-96, §1, 12-18-96)
(b) The owner shall also be liable for stormwater
charges, under this ordinance, for the improvement from
the date construction of the improvement began.
Sec. 20-239. Method of appeal.
(a) The Stormwater Utility charge may be appealed as
follows:
(1) A written appeal shall be filed with the City
Clerk prior to the utility charge due date; or
(2) Within thirty (30) days of payment, a written
challenge to the stormwater charge must be
filed with the City Clerk on behalf of the
customer, specifying all bases for the
challenge and the amount of the stormwater
charge the customer asserts is appropriate.
Failure to file a challenge within thirty (30)
days of payment waives all rights to later
challenge the charge.
(b) The committee of jurisdiction will determine
whether the stormwater charge is fair and reasonable, or
whether a refund is due the customer. The committee may
act with or without a hearing, and will inform the customer
in writing of its decision.
(c) The customer has thirty (30) days from the
decision of the committee to file a written appeal to the
Common Council.
(d) If the Council or the committee determine that a
refund is due the customer, the refund will be applied as a
credit on the customer’s next quarterly stormwater billing,
if the refund will not exceed the customer’s next quarterly
stormwater billing, or will be refunded at the discretion of
the Director of Finance.
(e) The period for determining a refund pursuant to
this section shall be limited to up to the customer’s prior

(Ord 96-18, §1, 10-23-18)
Sec. 20-240. Special assessment authority.
In addition to any other method for collection of the
charges established pursuant to this ordinance for
stormwater utility costs, the Common Council finds that
these charges may be levied on property as a special charge
pursuant to §66.0627, Wis. Stats. The charges established
hereunder reasonably reflect the benefits conferred on
property and may be assessed as special charges. The
mailing of the bill for such charges to the owner will serve
as notice to the owner that failure to pay the charges when
due may result in them being charged pursuant to the
authority of §66.0627, Stats. In addition, the City may
provide notice each September of any unpaid charges to the
Stormwater Utility, which charges, if not paid by
November 15, may be placed upon the tax roll under
§66.0627, Stats.
Sec. 20-241. Budget excess revenues.
The stormwater utility finances shall be accounted for
in a separate Stormwater Enterprise Fund by the City. The
Utility shall prepare an annual budget, which is to include
all operation and maintenance costs, debt service and other
costs related to the operation of the stormwater utility. The
budget is subject to approval by the Common Council. The
costs shall be spread over the rate classifications as
determined by the Council. Any excess of revenues over
expenditures in a year will be retained by the Stormwater
Enterprise Fund for subsequent years’ needs.
Sec. 20-242. Severability.
If any provision of this ordinance be found illegal, the
remaining provisions shall remain in effect.

ARTICLE VI. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
STANDARDS AND PLANNING
DIVISION 1. IN GENERAL
Sec. 20-300. Authority.
(a) This ordinance is adopted by the Common Council
of the City of Appleton under the authority granted by
§62.234, Wis. Stat. This ordinance supersedes all
provisions of a stormwater management ordinance
previously enacted under §62.23, Wis. Stat., that relates to
stormwater management regulations. Except as specifically
provided for in §62.234, Wis. Stat., §62.23, Wis. Stat.
applies to this ordinance and to any amendments to this
ordinance.
(b) The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to
limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same
governing body.
(c) The Common Council of the City of Appleton
hereby designates the Director of Public Works or designee
to administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
(d) The requirements of this ordinance do not preempt
more stringent stormwater management requirements
that may be imposed by any of the following:
(1) WDNR administrative rules, permits or
approvals including those authorized under
§281.16 and §283.33, Wis. Stat.
(2) Targeted non-agricultural performance
standards promulgated in rules by the WDNR
under s. NR 151, Wisconsin Administrative
Code.
(Ord 188-03, §1, 10-21-03; Ord 42-16, §1, 5-1-16)
Sec. 20-301. Findings of fact.
The Common Council of the City of Appleton finds
that uncontrolled post-construction runoff has a significant
impact upon water resources and the health, safety, and
general welfare of the City of Appleton and diminishes the
public enjoyment and use of natural resources.
Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
(a) Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing
streambank erosion, increasing streambed scour,
diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base
flows, and increasing stream temperature.
(b) Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to
support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply
uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended
solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens, and
APPLETON CODE
1350
Supp. #89
other urban pollutants.
(c) Alter wetland communities by changing wetland
hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.
(d) Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing
pollutant loads.
(e) Threaten public health, safety, property and
general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways,
and other drainage facilities.
(f) Threaten public health, safety, property and
general welfare by increasing major flood peaks, and
volumes.
(g) Undermine floodplain management efforts by
increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.
(Ord 188-03, §1, 10-21-03; Ord 42-16, §1, 5-1-16)
Sec. 20-302. Purpose and intent.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to
establish long-term, post-construction runoff management
requirements that will diminish the threats to public health,
safety, welfare, and the aquatic environment.
Specific purposes are to:
(1) Further the maintenance of safe and
healthful conditions.
(2) Prevent and control the adverse effects of
stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion;
prevent and control water pollution; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life;
manage building sites, placement of
structures and land uses; preserve ground
cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound
economic growth.
(3) Control exceedances of the safe capacity of
existing drainage facilities and receiving
water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion;
control increases in the scouring and
transportation of particulate matter; and
prevent conditions that endanger downstream
property.
(4) Minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged from the separate storm sewer to
protect waters of the state.
(b) Intent. It is the general intent of the City of
Appleton that this ordinance achieve its purpose through:
(1) Regulating long-term, post-construction
stormwater runoff from land development
and redevelopment activities.
(2) Controlling the quantity, peak flow rates, and
quality of stormwater runoff from land
development and redevelopment activities.
(3) Providing services to maintain and enhance
the quality of life within the community.
(c) Implementation.
To this end the City of Appleton will manage
post-construction stormwater runoff to protect, maintain
and enhance the natural environment; diversity of fish and
wildlife; human life; property; and recreational use of
waterways within the city of Appleton and its
extraterritorial area.
This ordinance may be applied on a site-by-site
basis. The City of Appleton recognizes, however, that the
preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance
standards set forth in this ordinance is through the
preparation and implementation of comprehensive,
systems-level stormwater management plans that cover
hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and
regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional
stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may
be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to
discharge to waters of the State of Wisconsin. Where such
plans are in conformance with the performance standards
developed under §281.16, Wis. Stat., for regional
stormwater management measures, and have been approved
by the City of Appleton, it is the intent of this ordinance
that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction
management measures acceptable for the community.

DIVISION 2. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Sec. 20-311. Applicability and jurisdiction.
(a) Applicability. This ordinance applies to all postconstruction
land development, redevelopment, and infilling
sites with one (1) acre or more of land disturbing
construction activities, except:
(1) A post-construction site with less than ten
percent (10%) connected imperviousness of
the total area based on area of land
disturbance, provided the cumulative area of
all parking lots, roads, and rooftops is less
than one (1) acre. However, the exemption
of this paragraph does not include exemption
from the protective area standards of this
ordinance.
(2) Agricultural facilities and practices.
(3) Nonpoint discharges from silviculture
activities.
(4) Underground utility construction such as
water, sewer, and fiberoptic lines. This
exemption does not apply to the construction
of any above ground structures associated
with utility construction.
Notwithstanding these applicability requirements, this
ordinance applies to any post-construction site of any size
that, in the opinion of the City of Appleton, is likely to
result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the
existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water, that
causes undue channel erosion, that increases water
pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate
matter or that endangers property or public safety.
(b) Jurisdiction. This ordinance applies to postconstruction
land development and redevelopment sites
within the boundaries of the City of Appleton and to all
lands located within three (3) miles of the corporate limits
pursuant to the City’s extraterritorial plat approval
jurisdiction as set forth in §236.45(2), Wis. Stat., even if
plat approval is not involved.
(c) County and town ordinances. This ordinance
supercedes any county or town stormwater management
ordinance for lands annexed to the City after the effective
date of the county or town ordinance, except when the
county or town ordinance is more restrictive than this
ordinance; then the more restrictive provisions set forth in
the county or town ordinance shall become part of this
ordinance and apply to the annexed lands. In such cases,
the City may grant a variance from the more restrictive
APPLETON CODE
1356
Supp. #89
requirements, provided that the criteria for a variance as set
forth in the county or town ordinance is met.
(d) State agency. This ordinance is not applicable to
activities conducted by a state agency, as defined under
§227.01(1), Wis. Stat., and the office of the district
attorney, which is subject to the state plan promulgated or a
memorandum of understanding entered into under
§281.33(2), Wis. Stat.
(e) Waivers. Requests to waive the stormwater
management plan requirements shall be submitted to the
City of Appleton for approval. Written waivers may be
granted administratively by the City for stormwater
requirements that are required only by the City if it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that it is
reasonable to expect that the objectives of this ordinance
will be met by the proposed post-construction land
development and redevelopment activity without a
stormwater management plan or portion thereof.
(f) Applicability of maximum extent practicable.
Maximum extent practicable applies when a person who is
subject to a performance standard of this ordinance
demonstrates to the City’s satisfaction that a performance
standard is not achievable and that a lower level of
performance is appropriate. In making the assertion that a
performance standard is not achievable and that a level of
performance different from the performance standard is the
maximum extent practicable, the responsible party shall
take into account the best available technology, cost
effectiveness, geographic features, and other competing
interests such as protection of public safety and welfare,
protection of endangered and threatened resources, and
preservation of historic properties.

suspended solids reduction, peak flow control, infiltration,
and protective areas standards applicable to the older
development or meet the redevelopment standards of this
ordinance, whichever is more stringent.
(b) Off-site drainage. When designing best
management practices for (c), (d) and (e) of this section,
runoff draining to the best management practices from offsite
shall be taken into account in determining the treatment
efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the efficiency
shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP
accordingly.
(c) Peak discharge
(1) The proposed post-construction land use shall
not increase peak flow rates of stormwater
runoff from that which would have resulted
from the same design storm occurring over
the site with the land in its pre-development,
woodland condition, as defined in Table 1 of
this ordinance for storms of twenty-four (24)
hour duration and recurrence intervals of one

depths and the Type II distribution.
(5) Existing wetlands shall not be incorporated in
the proposed stormwater management
practice for peak flow control. Peak flow
shall be managed prior to discharge to an
existing wetland. Should any changes to

provided for in this ordinance, all post-construction land
development and redevelopment activities subject to this
ordinance shall establish on-site management practices to
control the quality of stormwater discharged from the postconstruction
site. On-site management practices shall be
used to meet the following minimum standards:
(1) Total suspended solids (TSS). BMPs shall be
designed, installed and maintained to control
total suspended solids carried in runoff from
the post-construction site as follows:

total suspended solids load by eighty
percent (80%), based on the average
annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls.
b. For redevelopment less than five (5)
acres of disturbed land, by design,
reduce to the maximum extent
practicable, the total suspended solids
load by forty percent (40%), based upon
the average annual rainfall, as compared
to no runoff management controls.
c. For redevelopment five (5) acres or
greater of disturbed land, reduce to the
maximum extent practicable, the total
suspended solids load by eighty percent
(80%), based on the average annual
rainfall, as compared to no runoff

1358
Supp. #89
management controls.
d. For in-fill development by design,
reduce to the maximum extent
practicable, the total suspended solids
load by eighty percent (80%), based on
the average annual rainfall, as compared
to no runoff management controls.
(2) Total phosphorus (TP). All new
development, redevelopment, and infill sites
shall calculate the total phosphorus load and
the amount of phosphorus removed with the
proposed on-site practices with an
appropriate computer model. Both the load
and the amount of removal shall be reported
in the plan narrative and included in the
computer model submitted for the project.
(3) Effectiveness of the stormwater management
measures shall be evaluated using the latest
version of the Source Loading and
Management Model (WinSLAMM). Other
models may be used with prior written
approval of the City.
(4) Discharge of urban stormwater pollutants to
natural wetlands without pre-treatment shall
be avoided to the maximum extent
practicable. Where such discharges are
proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed
using a method such as the WDNR’s Rapid
Wetland Functional Value Assessment, or
other methods acceptable to the City of
Appleton and the WDNR. Changes to
wetland functional values because of
stormwater pollutant loads shall be avoided.
(Ord 66-10, §1, 4-13-10)
(e) Infiltration. Unless otherwise provided for in this
ordinance, all post-construction land development and
redevelopment sites subject to this ordinance shall design,
install, and maintain on-site best management practices to
infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following, to the
maximum extent practicable.
(1) Low imperviousness. For development up to
40 percent (40%) connected imperviousness,
such as parks, cemeteries, and low density
residential development, infiltrate sufficient
runoff volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least 90 percent
(90%) of the pre-development infiltration
volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate
infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than one percent (1%) of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
(2) Moderate imperviousness. For development
with more than forty percent (40%) and up to
eighty percent (80%) connected
imperviousness, such as medium and high
density residential, multi-family
development, industrial and institutional
development, and office parks, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an
average annual rainfall. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to
meet this requirement, no more than two
percent (2%) of the post-construction site is
required as an effective infiltration area.
(3) High imperviousness. For development with
more than eighty percent (80%) connected
imperviousness, such as commercial strip
malls, shopping centers, and commercial
downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff
volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least sixty
percent (60%) of the pre-development
infiltration volume, based on an average
annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
requirement, no more than two percent (2%)
of the post-construction site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
(4) Pre-development. The pre-development
condition shall be as specified in Table 1.
(5) A model that calculates runoff volume, such
as WinSLAMM, P8, or an equivalent
methodology shall be used. Other models
may be used with prior written approval of
the City.
(6) Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall
be required for parking lot runoff and for
runoff from new road construction in
commercial, industrial, and institutional areas
that will enter an infiltration system. The
pretreatment shall be designed to protect the
infiltration system from clogging prior to
scheduled maintenance in accordance with
Sec. 20-314 of this ordinance.
Pretreatment may include, but is not limited
to, oil/grease separation, sedimentation,
UTILITIES

biofiltration, filtration, treatment swales or
filter strips. It is desirable to infiltrate the
cleanest runoff to meet the infiltration
standard. To achieve this, the design may
propose greater infiltration of runoff from
some sources such as roofs, and lesser from
dirtier sources such as parking lots.
(7) For the purpose of this section, turf grass
swales are not counted towards the one
percent (1%) or two percent (2%) infiltration
areas described in subsections (1) and (2).
(8) Source areas.
a. Prohibitions. Runoff from the following
areas may not be infiltrated and may not
qualify as contributing to meeting the
requirements of this section unless
demonstrated to meet the conditions
identified in Sec. 20-312(e)(11):
i. Areas associated with a tier 1
industrial facility identified in s. NR
216.21(2)(a), Wisconsin
Administrative Code, including

Rooftops may be infiltrated with the
concurrence of the regulatory
authority.
ii. Storage and loading areas of a tier 2
industrial facility identified in s.
NR216.21(2)(b), Wisconsin
Administrative Code.
NOTE TO USERS: Runoff from
the employee and guest parking and
rooftop areas of a tier 2 facility may
be infiltrated but runoff from the
parking area may require
pretreatment.
iii. Fueling and vehicle maintenance
areas. Runoff from rooftops and
fueling and vehicle maintenance
areas may be infiltrated with the
concurrence of the regulatory
authority.
b. Exemptions. Runoff from the following
areas may be credited toward meeting
the requirement when infiltrated, but the
decision to infiltrate runoff from these
source areas is optional:
i. Parking areas and access roads less

commercial development.
ii. Parking areas and access roads less
than 5,000 square feet for industrial
development not subject to the
prohibitions under par a.
iii. Redevelopment post-construction
sites, except as provided under Sec.
20-312(a), Maintenance of effort.
iv. In-fill development areas less than
five (5) acres.

ii. Notwithstanding par. b., applicable
requirements for injection wells
classified under ch. NR 815,
Wisconsin Administrative Code
shall be followed.
c. Infiltration rate exemptions. Infiltration
practices located in the following areas
may be credited toward meeting the
requirements under the following
conditions, but the decision to infiltrate
under these conditions is at the
Developer’s option:
i. Where the infiltration rate of the
soil measured at the proposed
bottom of the infiltration system is
less than 0.6 inches per hour using a
scientifically credible field test
method.
ii. Where the least permeable soil
horizon to five (5) feet below the
proposed bottom of the infiltration
system using the U.S. Department
of Agriculture method of soils
analysis is one of the following:
sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty
clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or
clay.
(10) Alternate use. Where alternate uses of runoff
are employed, such as for toilet flushing,
laundry, or irrigation or storage on green
roofs where an equivalent portion of the
runoff is captured permanently by rooftop
vegetation, such alternate use shall be given
equal credit toward the infiltration volume
required by this section.
(11) Groundwater standards.
a. Infiltration systems designed in
accordance with this section shall, to the
extent technically and economically
feasible, minimize the level of pollutants
infiltrating to groundwater and shall
maintain compliance with the preventive
action limit at a point of standards
application in accordance with s. NR
140, Wisconsin Administrative Code.
However, if site-specific information
indicates that compliance with a
preventive action limit is not achievable,
the infiltration BMP shall not be
installed or shall be modified to prevent
infiltration to the maximum extent
practicable.
b. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the
discharge from BMPs shall remain
below the enforcement standard at the
point of standards application.
(f) Protective areas. Protective area means an area
of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes,
streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of
wetlands, and that is the greatest of the widths described
below, as measured horizontally from the top of the
channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest
impervious surface. However, in this section, protective
area does not include any area of land adjacent to any
stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff
cannot enter the enclosure at this location.
(1) Protective areas are:
a. For outstanding resource waters and
exceptional resource waters, seventyfive
(75) feet.
b. For perennial and intermittent streams
identified on a United States geological
survey 7.5-minute series topographic
map, or a county soil survey map,
whichever is more current, fifty (50)
feet.
c. For lakes, 50 feet.
d. For wetlands not subject to par. e. or f.,
UTILITIES
1361
Supp. #89
50 feet.
e. For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet.
Highly susceptible wetlands include the
following types: calcareous fens, sedge
meadows, open and coniferous bogs,
low prairies, coniferous swamps,
lowland hardwood swamps, and
ephemeral ponds.
f. For less susceptible wetlands, ten
percent (10%) of the average wetland
width, but no less than ten (10) feet nor
more than thirty (30) feet. Less
susceptible wetlands include: degraded
wetland dominated by invasive species
such as reed canary grass; cultivated
hydric soils, and any gravel pits, or
dredged material or fill material disposal
sites that take on the attributes of a
wetland.
g. In pars. d. to f., determinations of the
extent of the protective area adjacent to
wetlands shall be made on the basis of
the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility
of the wetland in accordance with the
standards and criteria in s. NR 103.03,
Wisconsin Administrative Code.
h. Wetland boundary delineation shall be
made in accordance with s. NR
103.08(1m), Wisconsin Administrative
Code. This paragraph does not apply to
wetlands that have been completely
filled in compliance with all applicable
state and federal regulations. The
protective area for wetlands that have
been partially filled in compliance with
all applicable state and federal
regulations shall be measured from the
wetland boundary delineation after fill
has been placed. Where there is a
legally authorized wetland fill, the
protective area standard need not be met
in that location.
i. For concentrated flow channels with
drainage areas greater than 130 acres, 10
feet.
j. Notwithstanding pars. a. to i., the
greatest protective area width shall apply
where rivers, streams, lakes, and
wetlands are contiguous.
(2) This section applies to post-construction sites
located within a protective area, except those
areas exempted pursuant to sub. 5.
(3) The following requirements shall be met:
a. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of
the protective area entirely or to the
maximum extent practicable. The
stormwater management plan shall
contain a written site-specific
explanation for any parts of the
protective area that are disturbed during
construction.
b. Where land disturbing construction
activity occurs within a protective area,
and where no impervious surface is
present, adequate sod or self-sustaining
native vegetative cover of seventy
percent (70%) or greater shall be
established and maintained. The selfsustaining
vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability,
maintenance of fish habitat and filtering
of pollutants from upslope overland flow
areas under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative
materials, such as rock riprap,
may be employed on the bank as
necessary to prevent erosion, such as on
steep slopes or where high velocity
flows occur.
c. Best management practices such as filter
strips, treatment swales, or wet detention
basins, that are designed to control
pollutants from nonpoint sources may be
located in the protective area.
(4) A protective area established or created after
the adoption date of this ordinance shall not
be eliminated or reduced, except as allowed
in subd. 5.b, c, or d below.
(5) Protective areas do not apply to:
a. Redevelopment post-construction sites,
provided the minimum requirements
within subd. 4 above are satisfied.
b. Structures that cross or access surface
waters such as boat landings, bridges
and culverts.
c. Structures constructed in accordance
with §59.692(1v), Wis. Stat.
d. Post-construction sites from which
APPLETON CODE
1362
Supp. #89
runoff does not enter the surface water,
including wetlands, without first being
treated by a BMP, except to the extent
that vegetative ground cover is necessary
to maintain bank stability.
e. Infill development less than five (5)
acres.
(Ord 66-10, §1, 4-13-10; Ord 42-16, §1, 5-1-16)
(g) Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling
and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum
extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed, and
maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the
runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible
petroleum sheen. A combination of the following BMPs
may be used: oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum
spill cleanup materials, or any other structural or nonstructural
method of preventing or treating petroleum in
runoff.
(1) This ordinance applies to:
a. New fueling and vehicle maintenance
areas approved after the effective date of
this ordinance.
b. Any modifications to existing fueling
and vehicle maintenance areas regardless
of the size of the disturbed area. BMPs
installed as part of a site modification
shall, to the maximum extent practicable,
be designed and operated to treat all
stormwater leaving the site so that the
stormwater contains no visible
petroleum sheen.
(2) A stormwater management plan per Sec. 20-
313 of this ordinance, a maintenance
agreement per Sec. 20-314 of this ordinance
and a stormwater permit per Sec. 20-321 of
this ordinance are required.
(Ord 66-10, §1, 4-13-10; Ord 42-16, §1, 5-1-16)
(h) General considerations for stormwater
management measures. The following considerations shall
be observed in on-site and off-site runoff management.
(1) Natural topography and land cover features
such as natural swales, natural depressions,
native soil infiltrating capacity and natural
groundwater recharge areas shall be
preserved and used, to the extent possible, to
meet the requirements of this section.
(2) Overland flow for all stormwater facilities
shall be provided to prevent exceeding the
safe capacity of downstream drainage
facilities and prevent endangerment of
downstream property or public safety.
(3) Overland flow paths from adjoining
properties to an offsite facility must be
maintained.
(4) Low impact development techniques and
green infrastructure should be included to the
extent possible. These techniques include but
are not limited to: increasing the time of
concentration by lengthening the flow path
and increasing the roughness of the flow
path, using native, deep rooted vegetation
instead of turf grasses and deep tilling onsite
compacted soil.
(Ord 66-10, §1, 4-13-10; Ord 42-16, §1, 5-1-16)
(i) Location and regional treatment option.
(1) The BMPs may be located on-site or off-site
as part of a regional stormwater device,
practice or system, but shall be installed in
accordance with s. NR 151.003 Wisconsin
Administrative Code.
(2) Post-construction runoff within a nonnavigable
surface water that flows into a
BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not
required to meet the performance standards
of this ordinance. Post-construction BMPs
may be located in non-navigable surface
waters.
(3) Post-construction runoff shall meet the postconstruction
performance standards prior to
entering navigable surface water.
a. To the maximum extent practicable,
BMPs shall be located to treat runoff
prior to discharge to navigable surface
waters.
b. Post-construction BMPs for such runoff
may be located in a navigable surface
water if allowable under all other
applicable federal, state and local
regulations such as s. NR 103,
Wisconsin Administrative Code and
Chapter 30, Wis. Stat.
(4) The City of Appleton may approve off-site
management measures provided that all of
the following conditions are met:
a. The post-construction runoff is covered
by a stormwater management system
UTILITIES
1363
Supp. #89
plan that is approved by the City of
Appleton and that contains management
requirements consistent with the purpose
and intent of this ordinance.
b. The off-site facility meets all of the
following conditions:
i. The facility is in place.
ii. The facility is designed and
adequately sized to provide a level
of stormwater control equal to or
greater than that which would be
afforded by on-site practices
meeting the performance standards
of this ordinance.
iii. The facility has a legally obligated
entity responsible for its long-term
operation and maintenance.
iv. Permittee must demonstrate that the
proposed post-construction land
development or redevelopment
activity has received permission to
use the off-site facility.
v. Permittee must also demonstrate the
flow path to the off-site facility will
not result in negative impacts to
structural improvements on the
property.
vi. Permittee must provide easements
of all overland flow paths up to and
including the overland flow path of
the 100-year storm
(5) Where a regional treatment option exists such
that the City of Appleton exempts the
applicant from all or part of the minimum onsite
stormwater management requirements,
the applicant may be required to pay a onetime
fee in an amount determined by the City
of Appleton. In determining the fee for postconstruction
runoff, the City may consider an
equitable distribution of the cost for land,
engineering design, construction, and
maintenance of the regional treatment option.
(6) The discharge of runoff from a BMP, such as
a wet detention pond, or after a series of such
BMPs, is subject to this ordinance.
(j) Additional requirements. The City of Appleton
may establish stormwater management requirements more
stringent than those set forth in this ordinance if the City
determines that the requirements are needed to control
stormwater quantity or control flooding, comply with
federally approved total maximum daily load requirements,
or control pollutants associated with existing development
or redevelopment.
(k) Swale treatment for transportation facilities.
(1) Applicability. Except as provided in Sec. 20-
312(h)(2) of this ordinance, transportation
facilities that use swales for runoff
conveyance, pollutant removal and
infiltration meet the stormwater discharge
quality requirements of this section, if the
swales are designed to the maximum extent
practicable to do all of the following:
a. Be vegetated. However, where
appropriate, non-vegetative measures
may be employed to prevent erosion or
provide for runoff treatment, such as
rock riprap stabilization or check dams.
It is preferred that tall and dense
vegetation be maintained within the
swale because of its greater effectiveness
at enhancing runoff pollutant removal.
b. Swales shall comply with sections V.F.
(Velocity and Depth) and V.G. (Sale
Geometry Criteria) with a swale
treatment length as long as that specified
in section V.C. (Pre-Treatment) of the
Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources technical standard 1005
“Vegetated Infiltration Swales”, dated
May 2007, or a superseding document.
Transportation facility swale treatment
does not have to comply with other
sections of technical standard 1005.
(2) Other requirements.
a. The City of Appleton may, consistent
with water quality standards, require
other provisions of this section be met
on a transportation facility with average
daily traffic of vehicles greater than two
thousand five hundred (2,500) per day
and where the initial surface water of the
state that the runoff directly enters is any
of the following:
i. An outstanding resource water.
ii. An exceptional resource water.
APPLETON CODE
1364
Supp. #89
iii. Waters listed in s. 303(d) of the
Federal Clean Water Act that are
identified as impaired in whole or in
part, because of nonpoint source
impacts.
iv. Waters where targeted performance
standards are developed under s.
NR 151.004, Wisconsin
Administrative Code, to meet water
quality standards.
b. The transportation facility authority shall
contact the City to determine if
additional BMPs beyond a water quality
swale are needed under this subsection.

DIVISION 3. COMPLIANCE MONITORING
Sec. 20-421. Right of entry: inspecting and sampling.
(a) The authorized enforcement agency shall be
permitted to enter and inspect any property subject to
regulation under this ordinance as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance.
(1) If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
(2) Property operators shall allow the authorized
enforcement agency ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records.
(3) The authorized enforcement agency shall
have the right to set up on any property such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the property’s
stormwater discharge.
(4) The authorized enforcement agency has the
right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The
property’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices
used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to
safe and easy access to the property to be
inspected, sampled or monitored shall be
promptly removed by the operator at the
written or oral request of the authorized
enforcement agency and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the
authorized enforcement agency access to a
property is a violation. A person who is the
operator of a property commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement
agency reasonable access to the property for
the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this ordinance.

If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused
access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is
discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect, sample or
monitor as part of a routine inspection, sampling or
monitoring program designed to verify compliance with
this ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect
the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the authorized enforcement agency may
seek issuance of a special inspection warrant per state

The owner or operator of any activity, operation, or
property which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater, the MS4, watercourses, or
waters of the State shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or
watercourses through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, that is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
WPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These
BMPs shall be part of a Stormwater Management Plan

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as
any person responsible for a property or operation, or
responsible for emergency response for a property or
operation has information of any known or suspected
release of materials which are resulting or may result in
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater,
the MS4, or waters of the State, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency
within seventy-two (72) hours of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at
least seven (7) years.
Failure to provide notification of a release as provided
above is a violation of this ordinance.

this ordinance. Any person who has violated or continues
to violate the provisions of this ordinance, may be subject
to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may
be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner
provided by law.
(b) In the event the violation constitutes an immediate
danger to public health, public safety or the environment
the authorized enforcement agency is authorized to enter
upon the subject private property, without giving prior
notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the
violation. The authorized enforcement agency is
authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in
§20-440.
(c) Improper connections in violation of this
ordinance must be disconnected and redirected, if
necessary, to an approved onsite wastewater management
system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the
authorized enforcement agency.
(d) Any drain or conveyance that has not been
documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may
be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by
the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of
written notice of violation from the authorized enforcement
agency requiring that such locating be completed. Such
notice will specify a reasonable time period within which
the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined,
that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer,
sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or
point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary
sewer system or other discharge point be identified.
Results of these investigations are to be documented and

(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08; Ord 55-15, §1, 6-23-15)
Sec. 20-432. Warning notice.
When the authorized enforcement agency finds that
any person has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this ordinance, or any order issued hereunder,
the authorized enforcement agency may serve upon that
person a written Warning Notice, specifying the particular
violation believed to have occurred and requesting the
discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to
seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will
cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in
response to the Warning Notice in no way relieves the
alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Warning Notice. Nothing in
the subsection shall limit the authority of the authorized
enforcement agency to take action, including emergency
action or any other enforcement action without first issuing
a Warning Notice.
(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08)
Sec. 20-433. Notice of violation.
(a) Whenever the authorized enforcement agency
finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to
meet a requirement of this ordinance, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written
notice of violation to the responsible person.
(b) The Notice of Violation shall contain:
(1) The name and address of the alleged violator;
(2) The address when available or a description
of the building, structure or land upon which
the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
(3) A statement specifying the nature of the
violation;
(4) A description of the remedial measures
necessary to restore compliance with this
ordinance and a time schedule for the
completion of such remedial action;

shall or may be assessed against the person to
whom the notice of violation is directed;
(6) A statement that the determination of
violation may be appealed to the authorized
enforcement agency by filing a written notice
of appeal within three (3) days of service of
notice of violation; and

violator fail to restore compliance within the
established time schedule, the work will be
done by a designated governmental agency or
contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
(b) Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses,
and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or
discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or
APPLETON CODE
1378

operations shall cease and desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater
pollution or contamination hazards and the
restoration of any affected property;
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and
remediation costs; and

Sec. 20-434. Suspension of MS4 access.
(a) Reserved.
(b) Emergency cease and desist orders.
(1) When the authorized enforcement agency
finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person’s past violations are likely to
recur, and/or that the person’s violation(s)
has (have) caused or contributed to an actual
or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters
of the State which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the authorized
enforcement agency may issue an order to the
violator directing it immediately to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the
violator to:
a. Immediately comply with all ordinance
requirements; and
b. Take such appropriate preventive action
as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation,
including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
(c) Any person notified of an emergency order
directed to it under this Subsection shall immediately
comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In
the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the authorized
enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or
waters of the State, and/or endangerment to persons or to
the environment, including immediate termination of a
property’s water supply, sewer connection, or other
municipal utility services. The authorized enforcement
agency may allow the person to recommence its discharge
when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
authorized enforcement agency that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless further termination
proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this
ordinance. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part,
for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent
any future occurrence, to the authorized enforcement
agency within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the
orders to cease and desist all violations.

Sec. 20-435. Suspension due to illicit discharges in
emergency situations.
The authorized enforcement agency may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the State. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued
in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the MS4, or to minimize danger to persons.
(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08; Ord 55-15, §1, 6-23-15)
Sec. 20-436. Suspension due to detection of illicit
discharge.
(a) Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of
this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if
such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.
The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator
may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a
reconsideration hearing and the violator shall have an
opportunity for hearing under Wis. Stats. Ch. 68, except
when termination is necessary to abate an imminent threat
to the public health, safety, welfare or environment. The
violator may have a hearing under Wis. Stats. Ch. 68,
within ten (10) days of such emergency discontinuance.
(b) A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to
this Section, without the prior approval of the authorized
enforcement agency.
(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08; Ord 55-15, §1, 6-23-15)
Sec. 20-437. Prosecution and penalties.
(a) Any person that has violated or continues to
violate this ordinance shall be liable to prosecution to the
fullest extent of the law. In the event the alleged violator
fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of
violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described
therein within the set time period specified by the
UTILITIES

has taken one or more of the actions described above, the
authorized enforcement agency may impose a penalty not
to exceed $1,000 for each day the violation remains
unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. For
second and subsequent offenses, the penalty shall not
exceed $5,000 per day.
(b) Prosecution of violation. If the notice of violation
is not complied with promptly, the authorized enforcement
agency shall request the City Attorney to institute the
appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to restrain,
correct or abate such violation. Upon conviction the
violator shall be fined as provided hereinbefore for each
violation together with the costs of prosecution. Each day
that a violation continues shall be deemed a separate
offense.
(c) Abatement of violation. The imposition of the
penalties herein prescribed shall not preclude the City
Attorney from instituting appropriate action to prevent,
correct or abate a violation, or to stop an unlawful or illegal
act.
(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08)
Sec. 20-438. Enforcement measures.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the
requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, then
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate
the violation. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner,
agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to
allow the government agency or designated contractor to
enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.
(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08)
Sec. 20-439. Cost of abatement of the violation.
Within Sixty (60) days after abatement of the violation,

Any condition in violation of any of the provisions of
this ordinance and declared and deemed a nuisance, may be
summarily abated or restored at the violator’s expense.

exclusive of any other remedies available under any
applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the
discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek
cumulative remedies.
(b) The authorized enforcement agency may recover
all attorney’s fees, court costs and other expenses
associated with enforcement of this ordinance, including
sampling and monitoring expenses.
(Ord 67-08, §1, 3-25-08)
Sec. 20-442. Obligations of authorized enforcement
agency and City of Appleton.
Nothing contained in this Illicit Discharge and
Connection Ordinance shall require the City of Appleton or
the authorized enforcement agency to engage in any

(a) Permit required. No person, except upon order of
the committee of jurisdiction shall plant, transplant, move,
spray, brace, trim, prune, cut above or below ground,
disturb, alter or do surgery on any public tree or shrub

without first obtaining a written permit for such work from
the committee as provided in this section. This subsection
shall not apply to the City, public utilities or their agents.
(b) Issuance of permit; conditions.
(1) If the committee of jurisdiction determines
that the proposed work or planting described
in an application for a permit is necessary
and in accord with the purposes of this

type of soil, characteristics and physiological
needs of the species or variety of tree or
shrub, it shall issue a permit to the applicant.
(2) No person shall be allowed to remove any
public tree without replacing such trees with
trees of equivalent dollar value in the vicinity
of the removed trees. Pruning, abuse or
damage to any public tree by any deliberate
or negligent act that has devalued a tree will
be evaluated and the responsible party will be
liable for the loss of value of the tree to the
community. The value of trees shall be
determined by the Forestry Division of the
Department of Public Works by using the
current Guide for Establishing Values of
Trees and Shrubs as prepared by the
International Society of Arboriculture. If no

as often as it deems necessary, shall meet
with representatives designated by public
utilities engaged in tree trimming or removal
in the City to discuss clearance practices and
particularly any practices the committees of
jurisdiction shall find not in the best interests

granted in writing by the committee of
jurisdiction to each utility to cover any
clearance work done in the next twelve- (12-)

Sec. 21-48. Planting and removal of trees.
(a) Street widening.
(1) When trees are removed in preparation for
widening of any established street, new trees
will be planted provided that, in the opinion
of the committee of jurisdiction, there is
adequate land in the terrace to reasonably
support tree growth. The cost of this
replanting is to be borne by the City. The
committee shall determine the location of
each tree to be planted and the species.
(2) The committee may also plant trees at City
cost on private property abutting the widened
streets if the terrace does not contain
sufficient land to support tree growth and the
property owner provides written permission
to enter and plant trees. When the planting
has been completed, maintenance and care of
the trees on private property shall be the
responsibility of the property owner.
(b) New streets. Following the installation of curbing
and sidewalks, the committee of jurisdiction, either by
request of the property owner or by resolution of the
Common Council, shall cause trees to be planted in the
terraces of such streets in the proper season. The location
of each tree, the species and size of stock are to be
determined by the committee. All or part of the cost of
such planting may be assessed against each lot or parcel of
adjacent property in accordance with W.S.A. §27.09 or
W.S.A. §66.0627. The committee shall replace any tree
planted under the plan which does not survive a period of
two (2) years at no additional cost of the owners of the
adjacent property.
(c) Established streets. Either by request of the
property owner or by resolution of the Common Council,
the committee of jurisdiction shall cause the planting of
additional trees or the removal or replacement of unsightly
or diseased trees in the terrace of any established street.
The cost of the removal of existing trees shall be borne by
the City. All or part of the cost of such replanting may be
assessed against owners of adjacent property in accordance
with W.S.A. §27.08 or W.S.A. §66.0627. The committee
shall replace any tree planted under this plant which does
not survive a period of two (2) years at no additional cost to
the owners of the adjacent property.
(d) Other sites. Should any owner of adjacent
property desire to plant a tree on any public place, a permit
shall be obtained from the committee of jurisdiction in
which the species, size of the tree and location shall be
designated. The cost of such planting shall be borne by the
property owner.

ARTICLE III. TREE INSECTS AND DISEASE
Sec. 21-66. Introduction.
(a) Whereas, the Common Council has determined
that the health of trees within the City may be threatened by
insects or disease and that the loss of the trees growing
upon public and private premises would substantially
depreciate the market value of property within the City and
impair the safety, welfare and convenience of the public,
the Council hereby declares its intention to control the
spread of such insects or disease.
(b) Declaration of public nuisance. The existence of
trees, shrubs and other flora within the city are determined
to be valuable public and private assets which substantially
enhance the public welfare and are aesthetically significant
and economically important in terms of increased value
which accrue to public and private lands as a result of their
existence. The continued existence of injured or diseased
trees or other plantings, or the failure to properly treat the
same if treatment is available, which is likely to cause the
spread of disease or endanger persons because of the
deteriorated condition, is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance requiring abatement.
(Code 1965, §13.05; Ord 169-11, §1, 8-9-11)

Borer.
(5) Any tree, bush, shrub or other plant which is

infecting other plants.
(Code 1965, §13.05(1), (2) ; Ord 169-11, §1, 8-9-11)
Sec. 21-69. Inspection.
(a) The City Forester shall have the authority to
inspect or cause to be inspected all premises and places to
determine whether any public nuisance as defined in this
article exists thereon, and shall also inspect or cause to be
inspected any tree reported or suspected to be infected with
disease or insects.
(b) The City Forester may enter upon private premises
at all reasonable times for the purpose of carrying out any
of the provision of this article, upon the acquiring of a
special inspection warrant.
(Code 1965, §13.05(3), Ord 169-11, §1, 8-9-11)
Cross reference(s) – Nuisances, ch. 12.
Sec. 21-70. Abatement.
(a) Notification required prior to abatement on
private property. Whenever the Forester shall find with
reasonable certainty on examination or inspection that any
public nuisance as defined in this article exists on private
property within the City, the Forester shall not cause such
nuisance to be abated in any manner before notification to
the property owner.
(b) Abatement procedure.
(1) Notice. If the City Forester determines that a
dead or diseased tree or plant exists on any
private property in violation of this section, a
notice may be issued, in writing, by the
Forester to the property owner directing, as
appropriate, that such tree or plant be
removed or treated as therein specified to
protect surrounding trees or plants. A notice
issued under this section shall provide a
reasonable period of time within which to
perform. The notice shall also state that the
existence of the facts which give rise to the
notice constitute a public nuisance which
may be abated by the City upon failure of the
property owner to comply with the terms of
the notice.

procedures and tolerances as set forth by the State
Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer

declaration of the quantity, of contents offered in the case
of packaged commodity, or of the price per unit and the
unit based upon in the case of a bulk commodity.
(1) When the commodity is in packaged form, the
quantity, as it appears on the package, shall
likewise appear in the advertisement, provided
that where the law or regulation requires a dual
declaration only that declaration setting forth the
quantity in terms of the smaller unit of weight or
measure (the declaration that is required to appear
first on the package) need appear in the
advertisement.
(2) Whenever any commodity is advertised as
described, the appropriate method of sale as set
forth in §22-9 and in State Statutes and rules
adopted by reference shall also be applied in the
advertisement.
(3) There shall not be included as part of the
declaration required under this section such
qualifying terms as “when packaged”,
“minimum”, “not less then”, or any other terms of
similar import, nor any term qualifying a unit of
weight, measure, or count, for example “jumbo”,
“giant”, “full”, and the like, that tends to
exaggerate the amount of commodity in the
package.

is sold or is offered, exposed, or advertised for sale, by

case where the Plan Commission, excluding the chairman, unanimously denies the change, or in the case

three-fourths (¾) vote of the members of the Common Council is required for approval of the amendment to
this chapter.

map amendment. The Common Council may, at the request of the petitioner, consider the amendments
and special uses as a single vote or separate votes. Any Common Council action which includes approval
of a special use shall require a two-thirds (2/3) vote for approval.
(e) Zoning of annexed areas. All territory that is annexed to the City shall be assigned zoning classifications as
recommended by the Plan Commission during review of the annexation petition. The Plan Commission shall consider the
following criteria in selection of an appropriate zoning district for the annexed land:

change the zoning ordinance or the zoning map, such power and authority being reserved to the Common
Council of Appleton as provided in §23-65, Zoning amendments.

ARTICLE VIII. OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Sec. 23-150. Overlay districts purpose.
The Appleton overlay districts are intended to provide supplemental regulations or standards pertaining to specific
areas of the City, wherever these are located, in addition to, but not necessarily more restrictive than the “base” or
underlying zoning district regulations applicable within a designated area. Whenever there is a conflict between the
regulations of a base zoning district and those of an overlay district, the overlay district regulations shall supercede the base
district regulations.
Sec. 23-151. PD planned development overlay district.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this district is to encourage innovative design and a mix of uses in areas of Appleton
where such development could positively contribute to the physical appearance and function of land and development.
(b) Designation of planned development overlay district. The PD overlay district shall be designated by the Common
Council pursuant to the provisions of §23-65, Zoning amendments, and shall be shown as an overlay to the underlying
districts by the designation of PD on the City of Appleton Official Zoning Map.
In determining the proper location for such an overlay within the City, the City shall consider that these provisions are
intended to accommodate developments that involve one (1) or more uses that may be located in one (1) or more zoning
districts and provide the following:
(1) That the application of this overlay district would provide a choice in the type of environment available to the
public by allowing development that would not be possible under the strict application of other sections of this
chapter.
(2) That the application of this PD overlay district would encourage development and/or permanent reservation of
open space, recreational areas and facilities.
(3) That the application of this PD overlay district would accommodate a land use plan that permits preservation
of green space, natural vegetation, topographic and geologic features and historic resources.
(4) That the application of this PD overlay district would allow a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities which results in better urban design, higher quality construction and the provision of
aesthetic amenities.
(5) That the application of this PD overlay district would allow the efficient use of land, so as to promote
economies in the provision of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings and other facilities.
(6) That the application of this PD overlay district would allow innovations in development so that the needs and
demands of the population may be met by a greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings, and by
conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings, all in a manner so as to be
consistent with the character of the zoning district over which the PD overlay district is to be located.
(7) That the application of this PD overlay district would allow a land use which promotes the public health,
safety, comfort, morals and welfare.
(c) Minimum size of district. No district shall be established unless it contains the minimum area specified in this
section and has at least two hundred (200) feet of frontage or City approved private road access.
(1) The minimum gross area required for a PD overlay district is as follows:
a. Two (2) acres where the overlay is placed upon base, single-family residential districts.
b. Two (2) acres where the overlay is placed upon base, multi-family residential districts.
c. One (1) acre where the overlay is placed upon base, nonresidential districts.
ZONING
Supp. #89
1630
(2) Applications for a PD overlay district on sites containing less than the required acreage listed above, but not
less than the underlying zoning district requirements, may be approved upon proof by the owner that the
development is in the public interest and that one (1) or more of the following conditions exist:
a. The property contains steep topography or other unusual physical features which necessitates substantial
deviation from the regulations otherwise applicable, in order to ensure a safe, efficient and attractive
development.
b. The property is adjacent to an existing PD overlay district and will contribute to the maintenance of
amenities and values of the neighboring district.
c. The proposal involves the redevelopment of an existing area or makes use of an infill site that could not
be reasonably developed under conventional zoning requirements.
d. The property lends itself to creative design that will enhance quality of life in the proposed development.
(d) Designation of permanent common open space. No Development Plan for a PD overlay district shall be
approved, unless the plan provides for permanent, landscaped, open space equivalent to the following by type of PD
overlay district:
Percent of gross acreage
a. Planned residential development 35%
b. Planned commercial development 10%
c. Planned office development 25%
d. Planned mixed development 30%
(1) Open space may either be passive or active in nature and shall fully complement the proposed development.
Such open space may take the form of required yards, parks, playgrounds, landscaped green space, nature
walks and natural areas.
(2) Land donated for any public purpose, which is accepted by the City, may be credited towards the open space
requirement at the discretion of the Common Council.
(3) Where a planned development is to be developed in phases, a portion of the required open space shall be
provided in each phase. Maintenance of the open space shall be provided for in the planned development’s
restrictive covenants and/or the Implementation Plan Document (IPD) recorded as part of the project.
(4) Open space shall be either adjacent to, or readily accessible by, all properties within the PD overlay district.
Furthermore, open space shall be situated in such a way that it may be linked up with other open spaces
adjacent to the proposed PD overlay district.
(e) Area, height and yard requirements. Lot area, width, building height, yard, density and similar requirements
shall be provided in accordance with the underlying zoning district unless based upon performance standards specific to the
proposed uses or structures as they relate to the total concept of the PD overlay district as identified in §23-151(m),
Procedure for approval of a Development Plan within the district, of this section.
(f) Density, height, yard and other regulation exceptions. In the case of any PD overly district, the Plan
Commission may recommend and the Common Council may authorize, exceptions to the applicable bulk, height, yard and
other regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of such PD overly district, provided that the Plan Commission shall
find that such exception shall be for the purpose of promoting an integrated Development Plan as beneficial to the tenants
or occupants of such development, as well as the neighboring properties, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations
of this chapter for buildings developed on separate zoning lots.

Sec. 23-152. TND traditional neighborhood development overlay district.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this district is to allow for optimal development and redevelopment of land in a manner
that is consistent with the design principles of traditional neighborhoods. Promoting the proximity of residential,
commercial and civic uses capitalizes on the benefits received through the coordination and interaction of these uses at a
pedestrian scale. The district is intended to be mapped as an overlay upon existing, underlying zoning districts, the
requirements of which will also apply.
It is not intended that the City will automatically grant the use of exceptions or maximum density increases for all
traditional neighborhood developments overlay districts (TND overlay district), but it is expected the City shall grant only
such increases or uses which are consistent with the benefits accruing to the City as a result of the traditional neighborhood
development. Therefore, the City may require as a condition of approval any reasonable condition, limitation or design
factor that will promote proper development in the TND overlay district.
The following advantages are contributing factors found in a traditional neighborhood development:
(1) Designs that balance the needs of residential uses and non-residential uses while creating compatibility among
these uses;
(2) Designs that are compact, pedestrian-oriented and relate to the human scale;
(3) Designs that promote a variety of housing, types, styles and sizes;
(4) Designs that reflect the City’s development and planning policies reflected in the residential neighborhoods or
non-residential areas in which the district is to be located;
(5) Designs that enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving areas of natural beauty and natural
green spaces;
(6) Designs that counteract possible urban monotony and congestion on streets through promotion of all types of
transportation (walking, biking, etc.); and
(7) Designs that promote compatible architecture between adjacent buildings.
(b) Definition. For the purpose of this ordinance:
Traditional Neighborhood Development means a compact, mixed-use neighborhood where residential, commercial
and civic buildings are within close proximity to each other.
(c) Designation of traditional neighborhood development overlay district. The TND overlay district shall be
designated by the Common Council pursuant to the provisions of §23-65, Zoning amendments, and shall be shown as an
overlay to the underlying districts by the designation of TND overlay district on the City of Appleton Official Zoning Map.

In determining the proper location for such an overlay within the City, the City shall consider these provisions are
intended to accommodate developments that involve more than one use, that may be located in one (1) or more zoning
district, and provide the following:
(1) The application of this overlay district would provide a choice in the type of environment available to the
public by allowing development that would not be possible under the strict application of other sections of this
chapter.
(2) The application of this overlay district would encourage development and/or permanent reservation of open
space, recreational areas and facilities.
(3) The application of this overlay district would accommodate a land use plan which permits preservation of
green space, natural vegetation, topographic and geologic features and historic resources.
(4) The application of this overlay district would allow a creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities which results in better urban design, higher quality construction and the provision of aesthetic
amenities.
(5) The application of this overlay district would allow the efficient use of land, so as to promote economies in
the provision of utilities, streets, educational institutions, public grounds and buildings and other facilities.
(6) The application of this overlay district would allow innovations in development so the needs and demands of
the population may be met by a greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings, and by conservation
and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings, all in a manner so as to be consistent with the
character of the zoning district over which the TND overlay district is to be located.
(7) The application of this overlay district would allow a land use which promotes the public health, safety,
comfort, morals and welfare.
(d) Size of district. No district shall be established unless it contains the minimum area specified in this section.
(1) The gross area required for a TND overlay district shall be no less than ten (10) acres. All acreage shall be
contiguous.
(2) Applications for a TND overlay district, on sites containing less than the required acreage listed above, but not
less than the underlying zoning district requirements, may be approved upon proof by the owner the
development is in the public interest and one (1) or more of the following conditions exist:
a. The property contains steep topography or other unusual physical features which necessitate substantial
deviation from the regulations otherwise applicable, in order to ensure a safe, efficient and attractive
development.
b. The property is adjacent to an existing TND overlay district and will contribute to the maintenance of
amenities and values of the neighboring property.
c. The proposal involves the redevelopment of an existing area or makes use of an infill site that could not
be reasonably developed under conventional zoning requirements.
d. The property lends itself to creative design that will enhance quality of life in the proposed development.
(e) Designation of permanent common space. No plans for a TND overlay district shall be approved, unless the plan

removed from the special flood hazard area and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage
existing or proposed buildings.
Regional flood. A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A
regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the
FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of

(c) Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into four (4) districts as follows:
(1) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining
the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
ZONING
Supp. #89
1670
(2) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the
floodway.
(3) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during
the regional flood.
(4) The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to
reduce the regional flood discharge.
(d) Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and
actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (1) or (2) below. If a significant difference exists,
the map shall be amended according to Division 8. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile
elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall
be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was
determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator
and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to §23-293(c) and the criteria in (1) and (2)
below.
(1) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The
regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(2) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual
on-site inspection, field topographic survey, and any information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also
approve any map amendment pursuant to §23-305(f).
(e) Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is
contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Division. 8.
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property
owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(f) Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the
terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(g) Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and
counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply
if §13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by
the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when §30.2022, Stats., applies.
(h) Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(1) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §62.23, Stats.
which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall
continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(2) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or
easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(i) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum
requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers
granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear,
the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect
on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.

(j) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering
experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from
flooding and flood damages. Nor does this ordinance create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the
municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(k) Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.
(l) Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Calumet, Outagamie and Winnebago Counties floodplain zoning
provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis.
Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's
official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering
this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show
the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.
(m) General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether

defined by the pre-development ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the
immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost,
(compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal
volume of storage.
(3) If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as
flood storage district – on this waterway – is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision
to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge
calculated without flood plain storage, as per §23-305 of this ordinance.

additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the
passage of this ordinance or any amendment thereto.
(b) The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this
ordinance may continue subject to the following conditions:
(1) No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with
this ordinance. The words “modification” and “addition” include, but are not limited to, any alteration,
addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or
accessory structure or use. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered an extension, modification or
addition; these include painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other
nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water
supply systems or connections to public utilities. Ordinary maintenance repairs do not include any costs
associated with the repair of a damaged structure.
The construction of a deck that does not exceed two hundred (200) square feet and that is adjacent to the
exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure
may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure.
(2) If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive
months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon,
shall conform to the applicable requirements of this ordinance;
(3) The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their
present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the
percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent;
NOTE: Documentation is only required for modifications made to nonconforming structures and uses located
in the floodplain.
(4) No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which
over the life of the structure would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its present equalized assessed value,
shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a
conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this ordinance. Contiguous dry land access
must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with §23-253(a). The costs of elevating a
nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded
from the fifty percent (50%) provisions of this paragraph;
(5) a. Except as provided in subd. b, if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use
is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and
the structure meet the current ordinance requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if
the total cost to restore the structure to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the structure’s present equalized assessed value.
b. For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or
reconstruction of any such nonconforming building may be permitted in order to restore it after the
nonflood disaster, provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of the minimum requirements
under 44 CFR Part 60, or under the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(6) A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structures continued
designation as a historic structure, the alteration will comply with §23-238(a), flood resistant materials are
used, and construction practices and floodproofing methods that comply with §23-295 are used.

ARTICLE XII. SEXUALLY-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS
Sec. 23-390. Purpose.
The Common Council finds that, due to their nature, the existence of sexually-oriented establishments in the City has
serious objectionable operational characteristics, such as an effect upon property values, local commerce and crime. Due to
the deleterious combined effect on adjacent areas when such uses are concentrated, they should not be permitted to be
located in close proximity to each other. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects
will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. Such regulations are contained in
these standards. These standards are designed to protect the City’s retail trade, maintain property values, prevent crime,
and in general, protect and preserve the quality of the City’s neighborhoods, commercial districts and the quality of urban
life.
It is not the intent of this article to limit or restrict the content of communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market.
(Ord 213-11, §1, 9-27-11

(a) Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color and
camouflaging architectural treatment, except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities.
(b) Wireless telecommunication service towers shall be of a monopole design unless the City determines that an
alternative design would better blend into the surrounding environment.
(c) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so
as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(d) The placement of wireless telecommunication antennas on roofs or walls shall include submittal of a report
prepared by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating the existing structure’s suitability to accept the
antenna, and the proposed method of affixing the antenna to the structure. Complete details of all fixtures and couplings

Sec. 23-425. Co-location requirements.
No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Inspections
Supervisor that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna. Evidence must be
submitted to demonstrate that the telecommunications equipment cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved
tower or building within a one (1) mile search radius (one-half (½) mile search radius for towers under one hundred twenty
(120) feet in height, one-quarter (¼) mile search radius for towers under eighty (80) feet in height) of the proposed tower
due to one or more of the following reasons:
(a) The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing tower or building, as documented by a
licensed professional engineer, and the existing tower cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced.
(b) The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing
towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant’s
proposed antenna. This interference would have to be documented by a licensed professional engineer. Documentation
would have to show that the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Existing towers and buildings within the search radius are not of sufficient height to function reasonably as
documented by a licensed professional engineer.
(d) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to
adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to
be unreasonable.
Sec. 23-426. Accommodation of other uses (co-location).
(a) Any proposed telecommunication tower and tower site shall be designed, structurally, electrically and in all
respects to accommodate co-location of both the applicant’s antenna(s) and comparable antenna(s), for at least two (2)
additional users. Towers and tower sites shall be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower, to
accept antennas mounted at varying heights and to accommodate supporting buildings and equipment on the antenna site.
(b) The holder of a special use permit for a tower shall not make co-location on the tower and tower site for the
additional users economically unfeasible. If additional user(s) demonstrate (through an independent arbitrator or other
pertinent means) that the holder of a tower permit has made co-location on such tower and tower site economically
unfeasible, then the tower permit shall become null and void.
Sec. 23-427. Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered
abandoned. In such circumstances, the following shall apply:
(a) The owner of such antenna or tower or owner(s) of the property where the tower site is located shall remove the
antenna and/or tower including all supporting equipment and building(s) within ninety (90) days of receipt of an
abandonment notice from the City Inspection Division. If removal to the satisfaction of the Inspections Supervisor does not
occur within the ninety (90) days, the City may remove and salvage the antenna or tower and all supporting equipment and
building(s) at the property owner’s expense. If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall
not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
(b) The applicant for a permit under this ordinance shall submit a copy of a signed agreement between the property
owner and owner of the tower, antenna(s) and supporting equipment and building(s) detailing requirements for
abandonment and subsequent removal based on the provisions of (h)(1). The agreement shall also identify that the
agreement shall be binding on future property owner(s) and future owner(s) of a tower, antenna and all supporting
equipment and building(s).

ARTICLE XIV. SIGNS*
DIVISION 1. INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION
Sec. 23-500. Purpose.
The purpose of these sign regulations is to provide comprehensive and balanced sign regulations that will preserve the
right of free speech and expression; avoid excessive levels of visual clutter or distraction that are potentially harmful to
traffic and pedestrian safety, property values, business opportunities, and community appearance; ensure that signs are
well-constructed and maintained and expressive of the identity of individual activities and the community as a whole; and
provide a procedure for fair and consistent enforcement and to implement the applicable policies and objectives as
identified in the Appleton Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord 34-18, §1, 4-10-18)
Sec. 23-501. No discrimination against non-commercial signs or speech.
The owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed under this Article XIV may substitute noncommercial copy in lieu
of any other commercial or noncommercial copy. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval
or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over
noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial copy over any other noncommercial copy. This
provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary. This provision does not create a right to increase the
total amount of signage in terms of size and number on a parcel or within a development or allow the exchange of an offsite
commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message.
(Ord 34-18, §1, 4-10-18)
Sec. 23-502. Severability.
If any portion of this Article XIV or any regulation contained herein is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court
of competent jurisdiction, it is the City’s specific legislative intent that said portion or regulation is to be deemed severed
from this Article XIV and should in no way affect or diminish the validity of the remainder of Article XIV or any other sign
regulation set forth herein.

(i) Alternative compliance landscape plan. An alternative compliance landscape plan may be approved by the
Community and Economic Development Director, upon request, if an applicant demonstrates that the intent of this section
can be more effectively met, in whole or in part, through alternative means. If approved, an alternative compliance
landscape plan shall be substituted, in whole or in part, for a landscape plan meeting the express terms of this section.
Alternative compliance is not a departure, variance or a waiver. The proposed solution must meet or exceed otherwise
applicable landscaping and screening requirements as established in this section.
(1) Procedure. Alternative compliance landscape plans shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the
landscape plan procedures as identified in this section. The plan shall be clearly labeled as an "Alternative
Compliance Landscape Plan,” and it shall clearly identify the modifications and alternatives proposed.
(2) Review criteria. In reviewing proposed alternative compliance landscape plans, favorable consideration shall
be given to exceptional landscape designs that attempt to preserve and incorporate existing vegetation in
excess of minimum standards and plans that demonstrate innovative design and use of plant materials.
Alternative compliance landscape plans may be approved upon a finding that any of the following
circumstances exist on the proposed building site or surrounding properties:
a. Natural land characteristics or existing vegetation on the proposed development site would achieve the
intent of this article;
b. Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the proposed development site to achieve a
screening effect that is equivalent to the screening standards of this section;
c. The required landscaping or buffering would be ineffective at maturity due to topography or the location
of improvements on the site; or
d. The proposed alternative represents a plan that is as good or better than a plan prepared in strict
compliance with the other standards of this section.
e. The alternative landscaping plan would achieve a better way to help achieve the containment of
stormwater or enhance the overall quality of stormwater.
(j) Modifications of standards. The Community and Economic Development Director shall have the authority to
waive or modify the requirements and standards of this section for good cause shown by the applicant.

As used in this article of the zoning ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
Navigable waters means Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within Wisconsin and all streams,
ponds, sloughs, flowages and other waters within the territorial limits of this state, including the Wisconsin portion of

Ordinary high-water mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water
is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation,
predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic. Where the bank or shore at any particular
place is of such character that it is difficult or impossible to ascertain where the point of ordinary high-water mark is,
recourse may be had to the opposite bank of a stream or to other places on the shore of a lake or flowage to determine
whether a given stage of water is above or below the ordinary high-water mark.
Principal building means a building which contains the primary use of the lot, as contrasted to accessory structure,

maps. If evidence to the contrary is presented, the Director of Public Works shall make the initial determination whether or
not the lake, pond, or flowage in question is navigable under the laws of the State. The Director of Public Works shall also
make the initial determination of the location of the Ordinary High Water Mark.
(b) Within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable rivers or streams. For the purposes of this
subsection, rivers and streams in the City shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated under one of the

buffer zone along the entire shoreline of the property and extending thirty-five (35) inland from the ordinary high water
mark of a navigable water, except as provided in subsection (2).
(d) If the vegetation in a vegetative buffer zone contains invasive species or dead or diseased vegetation the owner of
the shoreland property may remove the vegetation, except that if the owner removes all of the vegetation in the vegetative
