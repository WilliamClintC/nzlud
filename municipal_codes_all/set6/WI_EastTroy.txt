§ 1-1. Principles of construction.
The following rules or meanings shall be applied in the construction and
interpretation of ordinances codified in this Code of Ordinances, unless
such application would be clearly inconsistent with the plain meaning or
intent of the ordinances:
A. Acts by agents. When an ordinance requires that an act be done by a
person which may be legally performed by an authorized agent of that
principal person, the requirement shall be construed to include all acts
performed by such agents.
B. Code and Code of Ordinances. The words "Code," "Code of Ordinances"
and "Municipal Code," when used in any section of this Code, shall refer
to this Code of Ordinances of the Village of East Troy unless the context
of the section clearly indicates otherwise.
C. Computation of time. In computing any period of time prescribed or
allowed by these ordinances, the day of the act or event from which the
period of time begins to run shall not be included, but the last day of the
period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal
holiday. If the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven
days, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the
computation. As used in this subsection, "legal holiday" means any
statewide legal holiday specified by state law.
D. Fine. The term "fine" shall be the equivalent of the word "forfeiture"
and vice versa.
E. Gender. Use has been made of masculine pronouns in these ordinances
solely for the sake of brevity. Unless specifically stated to the contrary,
this Code of Ordinances is gender neutral and words in these
ordinances referring to the masculine gender shall also be construed to
apply to females and vice versa.
F. General rule. All words and phrases shall be construed according to
their plain meaning in common usage. However, words or phrases with
a technical or special meaning shall be understood and construed
according to that technical or special meaning, if such is the intent of
the ordinance.
G. Joint authority. All words purporting to give a joint authority to three or
more Village officers or employees shall be construed as giving such
authority to a majority of such officers or other persons.
H. Officers. The term "officers" shall refer solely to local offices created by
state statute.

1:3

employees.
J. Person. The word "person" shall mean any of the following entities:
natural persons, corporations, partnerships, associations, political
bodies or any other entity of any kind which is capable of being sued.
K. Repeal. When any ordinance having the effect of repealing a prior
ordinance is itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive
the prior ordinance or any part thereof, unless expressly so provided.
L. Singular and plural. Every word in these ordinances referring to the
singular number only shall also be construed to apply to several
persons or things, and every word in these ordinances referring to a
plural number shall also be construed to apply to one person or thing.
M. Tense. The use of any verb in the present tense shall not preclude the
interpretation of the verb in the future tense, where appropriate.
N. Village. The term "Village" shall mean the Village of East Troy,
Walworth County, Wisconsin.
O. Wisconsin Administrative Code. The term "Wisconsin Administrative
Code" and its abbreviation as "Wis. Adm. Code" shall mean the
Wisconsin Administrative Code as of the adoption of this Code, as
amended or renumbered from time to time.
P. Wisconsin Statutes. The term "Wisconsin Statutes" and its abbreviation
as "Wis. Stats." shall mean, in these ordinances, the Wisconsin Statutes
as of the adoption of this Code, as amended or renumbered from time to
time. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02]
A. If the provisions of different chapters conflict with each other, the
provisions of each individual chapter shall control all issues arising out
of the events and persons intended to be governed by that chapter.
B. If the provisions of different sections of the same chapter conflict with
each other, the provision which is more specific in its application to the
events or persons raising the conflict shall control over the more
general provisions.
A. Code. The Code of Ordinances, Village of East Troy, Wisconsin, shall
take effect as provided by state law.

afforded by the Wisconsin Statutes in addition to the forfeitures and

assessment must be paid, however, within 10 years of the date of
the final resolution making the levy, unless the Board permits
additional time by allowing payment of the assessment in
installments, in which case the assessment shall be paid within the
time prescribed by the resolution permitting the installment
payments.

requirements, but only after the expiration date of such agreement.
A. Definition.
(1) Surplus Village property is that property which is owned by the
Village of East Troy and which has no further usefulness to the
Village. An item of property shall be considered to have no further
usefulness when:
(a) The item or its function has been totally replaced by other
Village property and no probable future function exists for it;
(b) The Village no longer performs the service for which the item
was purchased and no other service can reasonably be
provided by the item; or
(c) The item is no longer able to reliably or economically perform
the work required of it.
(2) Surplus Village property as defined in this section shall not include:
(a) Land or buildings, but shall include fixtures and such salvage
as may be taken from a building without structural damage
when such fixtures and salvage are not part of a demolition
contract.
(b) Property which is obtained by the Village as a result of
abandonment or loss by the property's original owner.
(c) Items of property which are traded in for newer items.
B. Determination of surplus Village property.
(1) Whenever an item of Village property is determined to be surplus
Village property on the basis that the Village no longer performs
§ 105-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 109-1
1:75
the service for which the item was purchased, the Village Board
shall determine whether or not the item is surplus Village property.
(2) Whenever the fair market value of the item is more than $5,000,
the Village Board shall determine whether or not the item is
surplus Village property.
C. Disposition of surplus Village property.
(1) Whenever the Village Board determines that an item of property is
surplus Village property, it shall dispose of such property as it
determines.
(2) Whenever the fair market value of an item is more than $500 and
the Village Board had determined, pursuant to Subsection B, that

responsible for the item shall dispose of the property by:
(a) Donation to a nonprofit organization within the Village or to a
governmental agency;
(b) Public auction;
(c) Sale by sealed bid; or
(d) Negotiated sale.
(3) In the event of a public auction or sale by sealed bid, the item will
be sold in "as is" condition to the person submitting the highest bid;
provided, however, that a lower bid submitted by a nonprofit
organization or governmental agency may be accepted by the
Village Board. The department head responsible for the item shall
determine the time in which the successful bidder must remove the
item. In the event the item is not removed within that time, the item
shall revert to the Village and the amount of the bid shall be
forfeited to the Village. In the event no bids are received, the item
shall be disposed of as directed by the Village Board.
(4) No public auction or awarding of bids shall occur under this section
unless a description of the item to be sold and an advance notice of
the time and place for such auction or bid submission are first
published as a Class 2 notice in the official Village newspaper.
(5) Whenever the fair market value of an item is $500 or less and the
Village Board has determined, pursuant to Subsection B, that it is
surplus Village property, the item shall be either disposed of as set
forth in Subsection C(2) above or destroyed.
D. Determination of fair market value. Whenever this section requires a
determination of the fair market value of an item of property, that
determination shall be made by the department head responsible for
the property, whose decision shall be final.

auctioneer or take such other action as is necessary to properly
dispose of the property; provided, however, that the fees of such

disposed of according to this section.
(2) Lost and abandoned property will be examined by the Chief of
Police for identifying marks in an attempt to determine the owner.

Police to attempt to contact the owner to return the property. If no
identifying marks are present, the property shall be taken into

Chief, after consulting with the County Sheriff's Department,
are hereby authorized to determine the disposal procedure;
provided, however, that any such procedure will attempt to
return to its rightful owner any such material which appears to
have been stolen. In the alternative, the Police Department
may retain such weapons for use by the Department.53

property and arranging the time and place for the auction or
bid submission. Such notice shall be published in the official
Village newspaper. The property auctioned or sold by sealed
bid shall be sold in "as is" condition to the highest bidder. No
sale or auction shall occur until the Chief of Police has
determined that the property has no value to any probable
investigation or legal proceeding. The department head
responsible for the property shall determine the time in which
the successful bidder shall remove the property. In the event
the property is not removed within that time, the property shall
revert to the Village, and the amount of the bid shall be
forfeited to the Village.

written decision within 30 days. Review will be conducted in public with a
minimum twenty-four-hour notice. All proceedings will be transcribed and

thereof exceeds $50, in which case the actual cost shall be
determined by the legal custodian and billed to the requestor.
(5) The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and
shall require a cash deposit adequate to assure payment, if such
estimate exceeds $5.
(6) Elected and appointed officials of the Village shall not be required
to pay for public records they may reasonably require for the
proper performance of their official duties.
(7) The legal custodian may provide copies of record without charge,
or at a reduced charge, where he or she determines that waiver or
reduction of the fee is in the public interest.
G. Pursuant to Section 19.34, Wis. Stats., and the guidelines therein listed,
each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for
inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a
notice containing a description of its organization and the established
times and places at which, the legal custodian from whom, and the
methods whereby the public may obtain information and access to
records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of
records, and the costs thereof. This subsection does not apply to
members of the Village Board.
A. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal
custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably
describes the requested record or the information requested. However,
a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject
matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a
sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be
in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under
§ 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be
refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be
identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be
refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a
fee is required under § 122-4F(5). A requestor may be required to show
acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a
private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or
regulations so require.
B. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as
practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the
requester of the authority's determination to deny the request, in whole
or in part, and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after
conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a written request
is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the
§ 122-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 122-5
1:83
§ 122-6. Limitations on right to access.
request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner
which would permit reasonable compliance.55
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 122-6. If a request
is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a
written statement of the reasons for denying the request is made by the
requestor within five business days of the oral denial. If a written
request is denied in whole or in part, the requestor shall receive a
written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written
denial of a request shall inform the requestor that, if the request for the
record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review
upon petition for a writ of mandamus under § 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or
upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney.
A. As provided in § 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt
from inspection under this chapter:
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal
law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law
enforcement purposes, if federal law or regulations require
exemption from disclosure, or if exemption from disclosure is a
condition to receipt of aids by the state;
(3) Computer programs and files, although the material used as input
for a computer program/file or the material produced as a product
of the computer program is subject to inspection; and
(4) A record or portion of a record containing information qualifying as
a trade secret as defined in § 134.90(1)(c), Wis. Stats.56
B. As provided by § 43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records
are exempt from inspection under this section.
C. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is
not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after
conferring with the Village Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or
part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest
resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full
access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which
disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which
were necessary and given in order to obtain the information
contained in them.

personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if
disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon
the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data.
(7) Pursuant to § 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., communications between
legal counsel for the Village and any officer, agent or employee of
the Village, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy
with respect to current litigation in which the Village or any of its
officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or
communications which are privileged under § 905.03, Wis. Stats.
(8) Pursuant to § 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats., requests for confidential
written advice from an ethics board, and records of advice given by
such ethics board on such requests.
D. If a record contains information that may be made public and
information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record
shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the
information that may not be made public from the record before
release. The custodian shall confer with the Village Attorney prior to
releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the Village
Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment
of the custodian and the Village Attorney, there is no feasible way to
separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without
reasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the
entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.
A. Historical records. Under § 19.21(4)(a), Wis. Stats., municipalities must
notify the State Historical Society of Wisconsin (SHSW) prior to
destroying records. However, the SHSW has waived the required 60
days' notice for any record marked "W" (waived notice). The SHSW

Upon payment of the required kennel license tax and, if required by

fenced area. These tags may be transferred from one dog to
another within the kennel whenever any dog is removed from the
kennel. The rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag shall remain

requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition, to a
dog securely confined indoors, or to a dog securely confined in a

appropriate Village officials without any warrant, and the
application for a license hereunder shall be deemed a consent to
this provision. Any refusal to permit such inspection shall
automatically operate as a revocation of any license issued
hereunder and shall be deemed a violation of this section. Should
any kennel be found to constitute a public nuisance, the license
shall be revoked and the nuisance abated pursuant to Village
ordinances.
A. Dogs and cats confined. If the Village is quarantined for rabies, all dogs
and cats within the Village shall be kept securely confined, tied, leashed
or muzzled. Any dog or cat not confined, tied, leashed or muzzled is
declared a public nuisance and may be impounded. All officers shall
cooperate in the enforcement of the quarantine. The Village Clerk shall
promptly post, in at least three public places in the Village, notices of
quarantine. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02;

C. Quarantine or sacrifice of an animal suspected of biting a person or
being infected or exposed to rabies.
(1) Quarantine or sacrifice of dog or cat. An officer or animal warden
shall order a dog or cat quarantined if the officer has reason to
believe that the animal bit a person, is infected with rabies, or has
been in contact with a rabid animal. If a quarantine cannot be
imposed because the dog or cat cannot be captured, the officer may
kill the animal. The officer shall attempt to kill the animal in a
humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the
animal's head.
§ 189-3 EAST TROY CODE § 189-5

animal to be quarantined on the premises of the owner if the animal
is immunized currently against rabies, as evidenced by a valid
certificate of rabies vaccination or other evidence.

because there is reason to believe that the animal bit a person, the
custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal
under strict isolation under the supervision of a veterinarian for at
least 10 days after the incident occurred. In this subsection,
"supervision of a veterinarian" includes, at a minimum,
examination of the animal on the first day of isolation, on the last
day of isolation, and on one intervening day. If the observation
period is not extended and if the veterinarian certifies that the dog
or cat has not exhibited any signs of rabies, the animal may be
released from quarantine at the end of the observation period.
(3) Risk to animal health.
(a) If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is
reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid
animal, and if the dog or cat is not currently immunized against
rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall
keep the animal leashed or confined for 180 days. The owner
shall have the animal vaccinated against rabies between 155
and 165 days after the exposure to a rabid animal.
(b) If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is
reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid
animal, but if the dog or cat is immunized against rabies, the
custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the
animal leashed or confined for 60 days. The owner shall have
the animal revaccinated against rabies as soon as possible
after exposure to a rabid animal.
(4) Destruction of a dog or cat exhibiting symptoms of rabies. If a
veterinarian determines that a dog or cat exhibits symptoms of
rabies during the original or extended observation period, the
veterinarian shall notify the owner and the officer who ordered the
animal quarantined, and the officer or veterinarian shall kill the
animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage
to the animal's head. If the dog or cat is suspected to have bitten a

health department shall prepare the carcass, properly prepare and
package the head of the animal in a manner to minimize deterioration,
arrange for delivery by the most expeditious means feasible of the head
of the animal to the State Laboratory of Hygiene, and dispose of or
arrange for the disposal of the remainder of the carcass in a manner
which minimizes the risk of exposure to any rabies virus. The
Laboratory of Hygiene shall examine the specimen and determine if the
animal was infected with rabies. The State Laboratory of Hygiene shall
notify the Village, the veterinarian or local health department which
prepared the carcass and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a
person, that person or the person's physician.
F. Cooperation of veterinarian. Any practicing veterinarian who is
requested to be involved in the rabies control program by an officer is
encouraged to cooperate in a professional capacity with the Village, the
Laboratory of Hygiene, the local health department, the officer involved
and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a person, the person's
physician.
G. Responsibility for quarantine and laboratory expenses. The owner of an
animal is responsible for any expenses incurred in connection with
keeping the animal in an isolation facility, supervision and examination
of the animal by a veterinarian, preparation of the carcass for

the owner is unknown, the county is responsible for these expenses.

the officer or can be ascertained with reasonable effort, but if such
owner is unknown or unascertainable, the officer shall post written
notice in three public places in the Village, giving a description of the
animal and stating where it is impounded and the conditions for its
release, after the officer or warden has taken such animal into his/her
possession. If, within seven days after such notice, the owner does not
claim such animal, the officer may dispose of the animal in a proper and
humane manner, provided that, if an animal before being impounded

§ 210-1. Title, purpose and scope.
§ 210-2. Building permits and inspections.
A. Title. This chapter shall be known as the "Building Code of the Village of

B. Purpose. This chapter provides certain minimum standards, provisions
and requirements for safe and stable design, methods of construction
and uses of materials in buildings and/or structures hereafter erected,
constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, converted to other
uses or demolished and regulates the equipment, maintenance, use and
occupancy of all such buildings and/or structures. Its purpose is to
protect and foster the health, safety and well-being of persons
occupying or using such buildings and the general public.
C. Scope. New buildings hereafter erected in or any building hereafter
moved within or into the Village shall conform to all the requirements of
this chapter except as they are herein specifically exempted from part
or all of its provisions. Any alteration, enlargement or demolition of an
existing building and any installation therein of electrical, gas, heating,
plumbing or ventilating equipment which affects the health or safety of
the users thereof, or any other persons, is a new building to the extent
of such change. Any existing building shall be considered a new
building for the purposes of this chapter whenever it is used for
dwelling, commercial or industrial purposes, unless it was being used
for such purpose at the time this chapter was enacted. The provisions of
this chapter supplement the laws of the State of Wisconsin pertaining to
construction and use and Chapter 510, Zoning, of this Code and
amendments thereto to the date this chapter was adopted and in no way
supersede or nullify such laws and said Chapter 510, Zoning.
A. Permit required.
§ 200-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-2
1:157
(1) Building permit required. No one- or two-family dwelling, public
building or place of employment of which initial construction shall
be commenced after the effective date of this chapter shall be built,
enlarged, altered or repaired (which shall include heating,
ventilation and air conditioning) unless a building permit for that
work shall first be obtained by the owner, or his/her agent, from the
Building Inspector. Application for a building permit shall be made
in writing upon that form designated as the Wisconsin Uniform
Dwelling Permit Application, furnished by the Department of Safety
and Professional Services, or municipal building permit, as the case
may be.96
(2) Additions; alterations; repairs. Additions, alterations or repairs to
existing one- and two-family dwellings shall be governed by the
provisions of the Wisconsin Uniform Building Code as adopted
herein.
(a) Alterations and repairs required. When any of the structural
members of any building or structure have deteriorated from
any cause whatsoever to less than their required strength, the
owner of such a building or structure shall cause such
structural members to be restored to their required strength,
failing in which the building or structure shall be considered a
menace to public safety and shall be vacated and thereafter no
further occupancy or use of the same shall be permitted until
the regulations of this chapter are complied with.
(b) Extent of deterioration. The amount and extent of deterioration
of any existing building or structure shall be determined by the
Building Inspector.
B. Application. Application for a building permit shall be made in writing
upon a form furnished by the Building Inspector or his/her designee and
shall state the name and address of the owner of the land and also the
owner of the building, if different, the legal description of the land upon
which the building is to be located, the name and address of the
designer, the use to which said building is to be put, and such other
information as the Building Inspector may require.
C. Site plan.
(1) Site plan approval. All applications for building permits for any
construction, reconstruction, expansion or conversion, except for
one- and two-family residences in residentially zoned districts, shall
require site plan approval by the Plan Commission in accordance
with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall submit a
site plan and sufficient plans and specifications of proposed
buildings, machinery and operations to enable the Plan
Commission or its expert consultants to determine whether the
96.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 210-2 EAST TROY CODE § 210-2
1:158
proposed application meets all the requirements applicable thereto
in this chapter.
(2) Administration. The Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector
shall make a preliminary review of the application and plans and
refer them, along with a report of his/her findings, to the Plan
Commission. The Plan Commission shall review the application and
may refer the application and plans to one or more expert
consultants selected by the Plan Commission to advise whether the
application and plans meet all the requirements applicable thereto
in this chapter. Within 30 days of its receipt of the application, the
Plan Commission shall authorize the Building Inspector to issue or
refuse a building permit.97
(3) Requirements. In acting on any site plan, the Plan Commission
shall consider the following:
(a) The appropriateness of the site plan and buildings in relation
to the physical character of the site and the usage of adjoining
land areas.
(b) The layout of the site with regard to entrances and exits to
public streets, the arrangement and improvement of interior
roadways, and the location, adequacy and improvement of
areas for parking and for loading and unloading and shall, in
this connection, satisfy itself that the traffic pattern generated
by the proposed construction or use shall be developed in a
manner consistent with the safety of residents and the
community, and the applicant shall so design the construction
or use as to minimize any traffic hazard created thereby.
(c) The adequacy of the proposed water supply, drainage facilities
and sanitary and waste disposal.
(d) The landscaping and appearance of the completed site. The
Village Board may require that those portions of all front, rear
and side yards not used for off-street parking shall be
attractively planted with trees, shrubs, plants or grass lawns
and that the site be effectively screened so as not to impair the
value of adjacent properties nor impair the intent or purposes
of this section.
(4) Effect on municipal services. Before granting any site approval, the
Village Board may, besides obtaining advice from consultants,
secure such advice as may be deemed necessary from the Building
Inspector or other municipal officials, with special attention to the
effect of such approval upon existing municipal services and
utilities. Should additional facilities be needed, the Plan
Commission shall not issue the final approval until the Village has

II).
§ 210-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-2
1:159

development of such facilities.
(5) Appeals. Denials of building permits contingent upon site plan
approval may be appealed to the Board of Appeals by filing a notice
of appeal with the Village Clerk within 30 days of the denial.

Ord. No. 2019-18]
D. Dedicated street and approved subdivision required. No building
permit shall be issued unless the property on which the building is
proposed to be built abuts a street that has been dedicated for street
purposes. No building permit shall be issued until the subdivision and
required improvements are accepted by the Village Board.
E. Plans. With such application, there shall be submitted two complete
sets of plans and specifications, including a plot plan showing the
location and dimensions of all buildings and improvements on the lot,
both existing and proposed, dimensions of the lot, dimensions showing
all setbacks of all buildings on the lot, proposed grade of proposed
structure (to Village datum), grade of the lot and of the street abutting
the lot, grade and setback of adjacent buildings (if adjacent lot is
vacant, submit elevation of nearest buildings on same side of street),
type of monuments at each corner of lot, watercourses or existing
drainage ditches, easements or other restrictions affecting such
property, seal and signature of surveyor or a certificate signed by the
applicant and a construction erosion control plan setting forth proposed
information and procedures needed for control of soil erosion, surface
water runoff and sediment disposition at the building site. Plans,
specifications and plot plans shall be drawn to a minimum scale of 1/4
inch to one foot (fireplace details to 3/4 inch to one foot). One set of
plans shall be returned after approval as provided in this chapter. The
second set shall be filed in the office of the Building Inspector. Plans for
buildings involving the State Building Code shall bear the stamp of
approval of the State Department of Safety and Professional Services.
One plan shall be submitted which shall remain on file in the office of
the Building Inspector. All plans and specifications shall be signed by
the designer. Plans for all new one- and two-family dwellings shall
comply with the provisions of § SPS 320.09(4), Wis. Adm. Code.
F. Waiver of plans; minor repairs.
(1) Waiver. If the Building Inspector finds that the character of the
work is sufficiently described in the application, he/she may waive
the filing of plans for alterations, repairs or moving, provided that
the cost of such work does not exceed $2,000.
(2) Minor repairs. The Building Inspector may authorize minor repairs
or maintenance work on any structure or to heating, ventilating or
air-conditioning systems installed therein with a fair market value
of less than $500, as determined by the Building Inspector,
§ 210-2 EAST TROY CODE § 210-2
1:160
including market value of labor, which do not change the
occupancy area, exterior aesthetic appearance, structural
strength, fire protection, exits, light or ventilation of the building
or structure without issuance of a building permit.
G. Approval of plans.
(1) If the Building Inspector determines that the building will comply
in every respect with all ordinances and orders of the Village, and
all applicable laws and orders of the State of Wisconsin, he shall
issue a building permit which shall state the use to which said
building is to be put, which shall be kept and displayed at the site of
the proposed building. After being approved, the plans and
specifications shall not be altered in any respect which involves any
of the above-mentioned ordinances, laws or orders, or which
involves the safety of the building or the occupants, except with the
written consent of the Building Inspector.
(2) In case adequate plans are presented for part of the building only,
the Building Inspector, at his/her discretion, may issue a permit for
that part of the building before receiving the plans and
specifications for the entire building.
H. Inspection of work. The contractor shall notify the Building Inspector
when ready and the Building Inspector shall inspect all buildings upon
completion of the foundation forms or before the foundation is laid and
again when ready for lath and plaster, or before drywall or paneling is
applied. After completion, he/she shall make a final inspection of all
new buildings and alterations. Before final inspection, and as a
condition of the issuance of an occupancy permit, a registered land
surveyor shall inspect and submit an as-built survey showing the
location of all newly constructed buildings and their grades, as well as
certify to the Building Inspector that the as-built conditions
substantially conform to the plans and specifications previously
submitted to and approved by the Building Inspector. The Building
Inspector, in his/her sole discretion, shall have the authority to waive
minor discrepancies and/or waive the requirement for an as-built
survey when it is clear the improvements are located so as to comply
with zoning or any other such requirements. The bond paid by
contractor under § 210-2M shall not be released until the final
inspection is complete. The Building Inspector, in his/her sole
discretion, may grant occupancy where weather conditions do not
permit completion of the final grading. When the Building Inspector has
granted occupancy prior to the final inspection's completion, the bond
paid by contract under § 210-2M shall be held until the contractor
completes the final inspection. [Amended 8-19-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-12]
I. Permit lapses. A building permit shall lapse and be void unless building
operations are commenced within six months or if construction has not
been completed within one year from the date of issuance thereof.
§ 210-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-2
1:161
Permits may be renewed for one additional six-month term for just
cause unless it is new construction governed by the Uniform Dwelling
Code or Commercial Building Code, which supersede this section.
[Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02]
J. Revocation of permits.
(1) The Building Inspector or the Village Board may revoke any
building, plumbing or electrical permit, occupancy permit, or
approval issued under the regulations of this chapter and may stop
construction or use of approved new materials, equipment,
methods of construction, devices or appliances for any of the
following reasons:
(a) Whenever the Building Inspector shall find at any time that

operations have been completed, the foundation shall be removed and
filled to the adjacent grade, the property raked clean, and all debris
hauled away. Razing permits shall lapse and be void unless the work
authorized thereby is commenced within six months from the date
thereof or completed within 30 days from the date of commencement of
said work. Any unfinished portion of work remaining beyond the
required 30 days must have special approval from the Building
Inspector.107

that was done on that week. Combustible material shall not be used for
backfill but shall be hauled away. There shall not be any burning of
materials on the site of the razed building. If any razing or removal
operation under this section results in, or would likely result in, an
excessive amount of dust particles in the air creating a nuisance in the
vicinity thereof, the permittee shall take all necessary steps, by use of
water spraying or other appropriate means, to eliminate such nuisance.
The permittee shall take all necessary steps, prior to the razing of a
building, through the employment of a qualified person in the field of
pest control or by other appropriate means, to treat the building so as
to prevent the spread and migration of rodents and insects therefrom
during and after the razing operations.

pedestrian or vehicular traffic shall erect a fence, wall or railing at least
four feet high between such opening or excavation and the public rightof-
way.
C. Closing of abandoned excavations. Any excavation for building
purposes or any uncovered foundation which shall remain open for

and the Building Inspector shall order that unless the erection of the
building or structure on the excavation or foundation shall commence
or continue forthwith, suitable safeguards shall be provided to prevent
accidental injury to children or other frequenters or that the excavation
or foundation be filled to grade. Such order shall be served upon the
owner of record or the owner's agent, where an agent is in charge of the
premises, and upon the holder of an encumbrance of record in the
manner provided for service of a summons in the Circuit Court. If the

Such time shall be not less than 14 nor more than 20 days after service.
If the owner of the land fails to comply with the order within the time
required, the Building Inspector shall cause the excavation or
foundation to be filled to grade. The cost of such abatement shall be
charged against the real estate and entered on the next succeeding tax
roll as a special charge and shall bear interest at a rate established by
the Village Board from the date of the report by the Building Inspector
on the cost thereof pursuant to the provisions of § 66.0627, Wis. Stats.
A. Discharge. No person shall cause, allow or permit any roof drain,

discharging clear waters from foundation drains and ground infiltration
and where the building is not serviced by a storm sewer either shall
discharge into an underground conduit leading to a drainage ditch,

a dry well, an underground conduit leading to a drainage ditch or onto
the ground surface in such other manner as will not constitute a
nuisance as defined herein.
E. Storm sewer lateral. Where municipal storm sewers are provided and it
is deemed necessary by the property owner and/or the Village to
discharge clear waters from a parcel of land, a storm sewer lateral shall
be installed and connected to the storm sewer main at the expense of
the owner.
F. Conducting tests. If the Building Inspector or his/her designated agent
suspects an illegal clear water discharge as defined by this chapter, or
by any other applicable provision of the Wisconsin Administrative Code
as it may from time to time be amended, he/she may, upon reasonable
notice and at reasonable times, enter the private premises where such
illegal clear water discharge is suspected and conduct appropriate tests
to determine whether such suspected illegal clear water discharge
actually exists.

A. General requirements.
(1) No person shall move any building or structure upon any of the
public ways of the Village without first obtaining a permit therefor
from the Building Inspector and upon the payment of the required
§ 210-12 EAST TROY CODE § 210-14
1:176
fee. Every such permit issued by the Building Inspector for the
moving of a building shall designate the route to be taken and
the conditions to be complied with and shall limit the time during
which said moving operations shall be continued.
(2) A report shall be made by the Village employees with regard to
possible damage to trees. The estimated cost of trimming, removal
and replacement of public trees, as determined by the Village, shall
be paid to the Village prior to issuance of the moving permit. A
videotape of the route will be taken by the Village to compare any
damage caused by the move. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-18]
(3) Issuance of a moving permit shall further be conditioned on
approval of the moving route by the Village Board.
B. Continuous movement. The movement of buildings shall be a
continuous operation during all the hours of the day and at night, until
such movement is fully completed. All such operations shall be
performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No
building shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street crossing
or intersection or so near thereto as to prevent easy access to any fire
hydrant or any other public facility. Lights shall be kept in conspicuous
places at each end of the building during the night.
C. Street repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall,
within one day after said building reaches its destination, report that
fact to the Building Inspector, who shall inspect the streets, highways
and curbs and gutters over which said building has been moved and
ascertain their condition. If the removal of said building has caused any
damage to any street or highway, the person to whom the permit was
issued shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they were before
the permit was granted. On the failure of said permittee to do so within
10 days thereafter to the satisfaction of the Village Board, the Village
shall repair the damage done to such streets and hold the person
obtaining such permit and the sureties on his/her bond responsible for
the payment of the same.
D. Conformance with code. No permit shall be issued to move a building
within or into the Village and to establish it upon a location within said
Village until the Building Inspector has made an investigation of such
building at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied
from such investigation that said building is in a sound and stable
condition and of such construction that it will meet the requirements of
this Building Code in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs,
improvements and remodeling with reference to such building shall be
submitted to the Building Inspector, and he/she shall make a finding of
fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling
are in conformity with the requirements of this Building Code and that,
when the same are completed, the building as such will so comply with
said Building Code. In the event a building is to be moved from the
§ 210-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-14
1:177
§ 210-15. Establishment of water service.
Village to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the provisions
with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed
alterations to such building may be disregarded.
E. Bond.
(1) Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way
in the Village, the party applying therefor shall give a bond to the
Village of East Troy in a sum to be fixed by the Building Inspector
and which shall not be less than $10,000, said bond to be executed
by a corporate surety or two personal sureties to be approved by
the Village Board or designated agent, conditioned upon, among
other things, the indemnification to the Village for any costs or
expenses incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages
to any persons or property and the payment of any judgment
together with the costs and expenses incurred by the Village in
connection therewith arising out of the removal of the building for
which the permit is issued.
(2) Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be
a fact that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building
from its foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as
to permit the accidental falling therein of travelers or the location,
nature and physical characteristics of the premises and the
exposed excavation such as to make intrusion upon the premises
and the falling into such excavation of children under 12 years of
age unlikely, the bond required by Subsection E(1) shall be further
conditioned upon the permittee erecting adequate barriers and,
within 48 hours, filling in such excavation or adopting and
employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the
Building Inspector and reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent
the occurrences set forth herein.
F. Insurance. The Building Inspector shall require, in addition to said bond
above indicated, public liability insurance covering injury to one person
in the sum of not less than $100,000, and for one accident in a sum not
less than $200,000, together with property damage insurance in a sum
not less than $50,000, or such other coverage as deemed necessary.
A. Application for water service for all new construction and substantial
building renovation or remodeling shall be made, in writing, on a form
furnished by the Village of East Troy. The application will contain a legal
description of the property to be served, name of the owner, the exact
use to be made of the service, and the size of the supply pipe and meter
desired. (Note particularly any special refrigeration and/or airconditioning
water-consuming appliances.)

be considered a separate water customer.
(b) Multiunit buildings (apartment houses, high rises, etc.) shall be
supplied from a single large service with each unit separately
plumbed and individually metered with a remote register. All
meters shall be contained in a separate locked room or area
accessible to Village personnel. The room or area will be
limited to Village personnel and the owner to ensure the
integrity of the meter readings. The Village and owner will be
the only persons with a key to the room or area mentioned
above.
C. No division of the water service of any lot or parcel of land shall be
made for the extension and independent meterage of the supply to an
adjoining lot or parcel of land. No division of a water supply service
shall be made at the curb for separate supplies therefrom for two or
more separate premises having frontage on any street or public service
strip, whether owned by the same or different parties.

application wherein full information of the purpose of such supply is not
clearly indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner.

remaining provisions shall not be affected.
§ 210-18. Violations and penalties.
A. Any building or structure hereafter erected, enlarged, altered or
repaired or any use hereafter established in violation of the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed an unlawful building, structure or use.
Any such violation may be subject to a penalty as provided in § 1-4 of
this Code. In any such action, the fact that a permit was issued shall not
constitute a defense, nor shall any error, oversight or dereliction of duty
on the part of the Building Inspector or other Village officials constitute
a defense. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter may also be
enforced by injunction order at the suit of the owner or owners of any
real estate within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Any violation
requiring action to enjoin will promptly be reported by the Building
Inspector to the Village Board and Village Attorney, who shall bring an
action to enjoin the erection, enlargement, alteration, repair or moving
of such building or structure or the establishment of such use of
buildings in violation of this chapter, or to cause such building,
structure or use to be removed. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No.

except by written notice of the Building Inspector after satisfactory
evidence has been supplied that the cited violation has been
corrected.
(3) Each day each violation continues after the thirty-day written
notice period has run shall constitute a separate offense. Nothing
in this chapter shall preclude the Village from maintaining any
appropriate action to prevent or remove a violation of any provision
of this chapter or the Uniform Dwelling Code.

§ 217-1. Intent.
It is the intent of this article to regulate the nauseous, offensive or
unwholesome business that is carried on within four miles of the Village
limits, as is hereinafter designated. The intent of this article is to permit
the Village of East Troy to grow and develop in a manner that is consistent
with the best interests of the Village and to permit the Village of East
Troy to better exercise its extraterritorial zoning powers and create a longterm
master land use plan which will not be unduly affected by offensive
industry regulated hereinafter. The following are examples of the industries
determined to be offensive and requiring approval. The list is not all
inclusive, but these are examples: manufacture of cement, lime, gypsum,
plaster of paris, acid, explosives, fertilizers or glue, crematories, rendering
plants, refineries, tanneries or incinerators, stockyards or slaughterhouses,
junkyards or salvage yards, drop forges or foundries, storage of explosives
except as incidental to a permitted use, storage of gasoline or petroleum in
excess of 50,000 gallons, quarrying and extraction of materials.

sensibilities or adversely affect the person and property of ordinary persons
within the Village by reason of noise, dust, environmental pollution (air and
water), odor, lateral support, vermin, unsightliness, vapor, gases, odorous
substances (visible or invisible), safety, or any other condition that has a
negative impact upon ordinary persons or their property. Such industries
are hereby declared to be public nuisances since they could, unless
regulated, interfere substantially with comfortable enjoyment of life, health,
safety to another or others. Agricultural uses violating this article shall only
be regulated hereunder if the use is a threat to public health and safety,
pursuant to § 823.08, Wis. Stats. In addition, the same shall specifically

by the mailing (certified mail, return receipt requested) of a notice of
hearing on revocation to the applicant. Such notice shall be mailed at least
10 days prior to the date of the hearing. At such hearing, the applicant
may appear personally and by his attorney and present his defense to the

GENERAL REFERENCES
Streets and sidewalks  See Ch. 423. Subdivision of land  See Ch. 495.
§ 244-1. Purpose.
For the safety of the general public, the Village shall determine the location,
size, construction and number of access points to public roadways within
the Village limits. It is the Village's intent to provide safe access to
properties abutting public roadways suitable for the property to be
§ 217-12 EAST TROY CODE § 244-1
1:188
developed to its highest and best use, provided that access is not deficient
or dangerous to the general public.
§ 244-2. Driveway permit.
A. Permit required to construct, reconstruct, alter or enlarge. No person,
firm or corporation shall construct, reconstruct, alter or enlarge any
private driveway within the limits of the dedicated portion of any public
street under the control and jurisdiction of the Village of East Troy
without first obtaining a driveway permit therefor as provided by this
chapter. A driveway permit is not required when a new driveway is to be
constructed in conjunction with the construction of a new principal
structure; the driveway is included in the building permit process in
such cases.111
B. Application. Application for such permit shall be made to the Village
Director of Public Works on a form provided by the Village and shall be
accompanied by a drawing accurately depicting the portion of the
proposed private driveway to be constructed, reconstructed, altered or
enlarged lying within the dedicated portion of the public street, the
dimensions thereof and a statement of the materials proposed to be
used. Upon receipt of the application and the fee according to the fee
schedule, if required, unless the proposed private driveway is a part of
construction for a building or other structure for which a building
permit has been applied for, in which case no additional fee is required,
the Village Director of Public Works shall approve such application if
the proposed driveway complies with the terms and conditions of this
chapter and any other applicable Village ordinance.112
C. Application provisions. All driveway permit applications shall contain
the applicant's statement that:
(1) The applicant represents all parties in interest, and that such
proposed driveway is for the bona fide purpose of securing access
to his/her property and not for the purpose of parking or servicing
vehicles, advertising, storage or merchandising of goods within the
dedicated portion of the Village street, or for any other purpose.
(2) The Village, notwithstanding the construction of such driveway,
reserves the right to make any changes, additions, repairs or
relocations within the dedicated portion of the Village street, at any
time, including relocation, reconstruction, widening and
maintaining the street, without compensating the owner of such
private driveway for the damage or destruction of such private
roadway.

1:189
§ 244-3. Location, design and construction.
The location, design and construction of driveways shall be in accordance
with the following:
(3) The permittee, or his/her successors or assigns, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Village of East Troy, its officials,
officers, agents or employees against any claim or any cause of
action for personal injury or property damage sustained by reason
of the exercise of such permit.
(4) The Village does not assume any responsibility for the removal or
clearance of snow, ice or sleet, or the opening of any windrows of
such material upon such portion of such driveway within the
dedicated portion of the Village street.
D. Appeal from permit refusal. Any person feeling himself/herself
aggrieved by the refusal of the Village Director of Public Works to issue
a permit for a private driveway may appeal such refusal to the Village
Board within 30 days after such refusal to issue such permit is made.113
A. General design. Private driveways shall be of such width and so located
that all of such driveways and their appurtenances are within the limits
of the frontage abutting the street of the property served. Driveways
shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from any street
intersection area and shall not encroach upon or occupy areas of the
street right-of-way required for effective traffic control or for street
signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that
vehicles approaching or using it shall have adequate sight distance
along the street. Driveway approaches shall be at least 10 feet apart,
except by special permission from the Village Board, and driveways
shall, in all cases, be placed wherever possible so as not to interfere
with utilities in place.
B. Number. The number of driveways to serve an individual property
fronting on a street shall be one, except where deemed necessary and
feasible by the Village Board for reasonable and adequate service to the
property, considering the safety, convenience and utility of the streets.
C. Island area. The island area in the street right-of-way between
successive driveways or adjoining a driveway, and between the highway
shoulder and right-of-way, shall constitute a restricted area and may be
filled in and graded only as provided in Subsection F.
D. Drainage. The surface of the driveway connecting with rural-type street
cross sections shall slope downward and away from the highway
shoulder a sufficient distance to preclude ordinary surface water
drainage flowing onto the street roadbed.

§ 244-2 EAST TROY CODE § 244-3
1:190
E. Reconstruction of sidewalks and curb and gutter. When the
construction of a driveway requires the removal of a curb or gutter, the
new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable concrete material,
and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike
manner. The driveway surface shall be connected with the highway
pavement and the sidewalk, if any, with rebar for pinning material in a
neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway construction shall include the
replacement of such sidewalk areas which are inadequate or which are,
or may be, damaged by means of vehicle travel across the sidewalk.
Driveway should be made of concrete.114
F. Restricted areas. The restricted area between successive driveways
may be filled in and graded only when the following requirements are
complied with:
(1) The filling or draining shall be to grades approved by the Village
Board and, except where highway drainage is by means of curb and
gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the
street roadbed in a suitable manner.115
(2) Culvert extensions under the restricted area shall be of the same
size as the culvert under the driveway and constructed of metal or
concrete. Intermediate manholes adequate for cleanout purposes
may be required where the total culvert length is excessive.116
(3) Where no street side ditch separates the restricted area from the
street roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate
the area from the street roadbed to prevent its use for driveway or
parking purposes, by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts,
as may be required by the Village Board.
G. Relocation of utilities. Any costs of relocating public utilities shall be
the responsibility of the property owner, with approval of the Village
Board and Director of Public Works necessary before any utility may be
relocated and the driveway installed.117
H. Construction across sidewalks. All driveway entrances and approaches
which are constructed across sidewalks shall be of concrete
constructed in accordance with the requirements for sidewalk
construction in § 423-5 of this Code, insofar as such requirements are
applicable, including thickness requirements.
I. Variances. Any of the above requirements may be varied by the Village
Board in such instances where the peculiar nature of the property or

dedicated area of a public street shall, except as hereinafter provided
for, have a width greater than 30 feet measured at right angles to the
center line of said driveway, except as increased by permissible radii. In
instances where the nature of the commercial or industrial activity or
the physical characteristics of the land would require a driveway of
greater width than herein specified, the Village Board, in its discretion,
may permit a driveway of additional width.
B. Angular placement of driveway. The angle between the center line of
the driveway and the curbline shall not be less than 45°.
C. Island areas. Where the public sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, an
island of a minimum length of six feet measured along the curbline shall

measured along the right-of-way line shall be maintained along each
entrance to the Village street. All flares shall be tangent to the curbline.
A curb length of not less than three feet shall be left undisturbed
adjacent to each property line to serve as an island area in the event an
adjoining property owner applies for a driveway permit to serve his
property.

"structure" includes a private driveway, a portion of which extends into
any public road, highway or street, and which is in nonconformance
with this chapter.
B. No driveway shall be closer than 10 feet to the extended street line at
an intersection. At street intersections, a driveway shall not provide

not occupy areas of the roadway deemed necessary by the Village for
effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals.
C. The grade of that portion of any private driveway or pedestrian path
located within the limits of any public road, highway or street shall be
such as shall meet the grade of the existing public roadway at its edge
and not cause an obstruction to the maintenance or clearing of such
public roadway.
D. No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the
facing of the curb, and under no circumstances shall such driveway
apron extend into any gutter area. All driveway entrances and
approaches shall be constructed so as not to interfere with the drainage
of streets, side ditches or roadside areas or with any existing structure
on the right-of-way.
E. No portion of any curb, parapet or retaining wall, rising above the
grade of the driveway, erected by the owner of the premises involved,
shall extend beyond the culvert spanning the watercourse located in
such public way.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to:
(1) Ensure safe and effective hazardous materials and hazardous waste
management; and
(2) Establish a program of regulation over the storage, transportation,
treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and waste in the
Village of East Troy.
B. Findings. The Village finds that:
(1) Increasing production and consumption rates, continuing
technological development and energy requirements have led to
the generation and use of greater quantities of hazardous materials
and associated hazardous waste;
(2) The problems of disposing of hazardous waste are increasing as a
result of air and water pollution controls and a shortage of
available landfill sites;
(3) While it is technologically and financially feasible for hazardous
waste generators to dispose of their waste in a manner which has a
less adverse impact on the environment than current practices,
such knowledge is not being utilized to the extent possible;
(4) Even though the Village is not heavily industrialized, there are
significant daily hazardous waste disposal problems; and
(5) The public health and safety and the environment are threatened
where hazardous materials and wastes are not managed in an
environmentally sound manner.
C. Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable in this section:

F. Safety precautions for natural grass areas.
§ 289-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 289-4
1:215
(1) When, in the opinion of the Fire Inspector of the Fire Department
serving the Village of East Troy, the presence of a natural lawn may
constitute a fire or safety hazard due to weather and/or other
conditions, the Fire Inspector may order the cutting of natural
lawns to a safe condition. As a condition of receiving approval of
the natural lawn permit, the property owner shall be required to
cut the natural lawn within three days upon receiving written
direction from the Fire Inspector.
(2) Natural lawns shall not be removed through the process of burning,
unless stated and approved as one of the management and
maintenance techniques in the natural lawn management plan. The
Fire Inspector shall review all requests to burn natural lawns and
shall determine if circumstances are correct and all applicable
requirements have been fulfilled to ensure public safety. Burning of
natural lawns shall be strictly prohibited unless a written permit to
burn is issued by the Fire Inspector. The Fire Inspector shall
establish a written list of requirements for considering each
request to burn natural lawns, thereby ensuring the public safety.
In addition, the property owner requesting permission to burn the
natural lawn shall produce evidence of property damage and
liability insurance identifying the Village as a party insured. A
minimum amount of acceptable insurance shall be $300,000.
G. Revocation of an approved natural lawn permit. The Village Clerk, upon
the recommendation of the Weed Commissioner, shall have authority to
revoke an approved natural lawn permit if the owner fails to maintain
the natural lawn or comply with the provisions set forth in this section.
Notice of intent to revoke an approved natural lawn permit shall be
appealable to the Village Board. All applications for appeal shall be
submitted within 15 calendar days of receipt of the written notice of
intent to revoke the approved natural lawn permit. Failure to file an
application for appeal within 15 calendar days shall result in the
revoking of the natural lawn permit. All written applications for appeal
filed within the required 15 calendar days shall be reviewed by the
Village Board in an open meeting. The decision rendered by the Village
Board shall be final and binding. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No.
2015-02; 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
H. Public nuisance defined; abatement after notice.
(1) The growth of a natural lawn, as defined in this section, shall be
considered a public nuisance unless a natural lawn management
plan has been filed and approved and a permit is issued by the
Village, as set for in this section. Violators shall be served with a
notice of public nuisance by certified mail to the last known mailing
address of the property owner.
(2) If the person so served with a notice of public nuisance violation
does not abate the nuisance within 10 days, the enforcement officer
may proceed to abate such nuisance, keeping an account of the
§ 289-4 EAST TROY CODE § 289-4
1:216
§ 289-5. Regulation of length of lawn and grasses.
expense of the abatement, and such expense shall be charged to
and paid by such property owner. Notice of the bill for abatement
of the public nuisance shall be mailed to the owner of the premises
and shall be payable within 10 calendar days from receipt thereof.
Within 60 days after such costs and expenses are incurred and
remain unpaid, the Village Clerk shall enter those charges onto the
tax roll as a special tax, as provided by state statute. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(3) The failure of the Village Clerk to record such claim or to mail such
notice, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice, shall not
affect the right to place the Village expense on the tax rolls for
unpaid bills for abating the public nuisance, as provided for in this
section. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
I. Penalty.
(1) Any person, firm or corporation who or which does not abate the
nuisance within the required time period, or who or which
otherwise violates the provisions of this section, shall be subject to
the general penalty found in § 1-4 of this Code.
(2) In addition to any penalties herein provided, the Village may issue
stop-work orders upon owners of lots where work is unfinished
under a previously issued building permit for any violation of this
section.
A. Purpose. This section is adopted due to the unique nature of the
problems associated with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being
allowed to grow to excessive length in the Village of East Troy.
B. Public nuisance declared. The Village Board finds that lawns, grasses
and noxious weeds on nonagricultural lots or parcels of land, as
classified under Chapter 510, Zoning, of this Code, within the Village of
East Troy which exceed eight inches in length adversely affect the
public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen
and other discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a
safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in the grass, interfere with
the public convenience and adversely affect property values of other
land within the Village. For that reason, any nonagricultural lawn, grass
or weed on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds eight inches in
length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except for property
located in a designated floodplain area and/or wetland area, or where
the lawn, grass or weed is part of a natural lawn approved pursuant to
§ 289-4 above.
C. Nuisances prohibited. No person, firm or corporation shall permit any
public nuisance as defined in Subsection B above to remain on any
premises owned or controlled by him/her within the Village.
§ 289-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 289-5
1:217
D. Inspection. The Weed Commissioner or his/her designee shall inspect or
cause to be inspected all premises and places within the Village to
determine whether any public nuisance as defined in Subsection B
above exists.
E. Abatement of nuisance. If the Weed Commissioner shall determine with
reasonable certainty that any public nuisance as defined in Subsection
B above exists, he/she shall immediately cause written notice to be
served or mailed that the Village proposes to have the lot grass or lawn
cut so as to conform to this section and § 289-4.
F. Due process hearing. If the owner believes that his/her grasses or
weeds are not a nuisance, he/she may request a hearing before the
Village Board. The request for said hearing must be made in writing to
the Village Clerk's office within the five days set forth in the Weed
Commissioner's notice. Upon application for the hearing, the property
owner must deposit a bond of $25. If a decision is rendered in the
property owner's favor, the bond of $25 will be returned to the property
owner. If the property owner fails to appear for the hearing, or if the
decision is rendered against the property owner, the deposit shall be
forfeited and applied to the cost of Village personnel abating the
nuisance, if necessary. When a hearing is requested by the owner of the
property, a hearing by the Village Board shall be held within seven days
from the date of the owner's request. The property in question will not
be mowed by the Village until such time as the hearing is held by the
Board. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his/her
attorney, may present witnesses in his/her own behalf, and may crossexamine
witnesses presented by the Village, as well as subpoena
witnesses for his/her own case. At the close of the hearing, the Village
Board shall make its determination in writing, specifying its findings,
facts and conclusions. If the Village Board determines that a public
nuisance does exist, the Board shall order the Weed Commissioner to
mow the property in question, unless the property has been mowed by
the owner within 48 hours of the Village Board's decision. If the owner
does not abate the nuisance within the described 48 hours, the Weed
Commissioner shall cause the same nuisance to be abated and cost in
excess of the forfeited bond assessed accordingly [Amended
6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02; 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
G. Village's option to abate nuisance. In any case where the owner,
occupant or person in charge of the property shall fail to cut his/her
lawn, grass or weeds, as set forth above, then and in that event the
Village may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as follows:
(1) The written notice required in Subsection E shall inform said
person that in the event of his/her failure to abate the nuisance
within the prescribed time, the Village shall abate the same and the
cost thereof shall be assessed to the property owner as a special
charge.

§ 289-7. Sewage disposal.139
(2) The Village shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the
subject's property and shall charge the expenses of so doing at a
rate as established by resolution by the Village Board. The charges
shall be set forth in a statement to the Village Clerk who, in turn,
shall mail the same to the owner, occupant or person in charge of
the subject premises. If said statement is not paid in full within 30
days thereafter, the Village Clerk shall enter the charges in the tax
roll as a special tax against said lot or parcel of land, and the same
shall be collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate,
or as provided under § 66.0907(3)(f), Wis. Stats. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
A. Whenever public sewer or water service has become available to any
building used for human habitation or human occupancy, the Village
Board shall notify in writing the owner, agent or occupant thereof to
connect such facilities thereto. If such persons to whom the notice has
been given shall fail to comply for more than 10 days after notice, the
Village Board shall cause the necessary connections to be made and the
expenses thereof to be assessed as a special tax against the property,
pursuant to § 281.45, Wis. Stats.138
B. The Village Board may extend the time for connection hereunder or
may grant other temporary relief where strict enforcement would work
an unnecessary hardship without corresponding public or private
benefit.
C. This section is enacted pursuant to § 281.45, Wis. Stats.
A. Inspector. The Village Board appoints the Director of Public Works as
superintendent of the sewage works and as inspector to act under the
direction of the Village Board and to have control of the supervision and
inspection of drainage, drain laying and sewer connections, and to
enforce all the laws and ordinances and rules in relation thereto.
B. Connection; compliance with state statutes.
(1) Requirement.
(a) The owners of all houses, buildings, or other structures used

to such owner or his agent by registered mail addressed to the
last known address of the owner or his agent of the
requirement to make connection to the Village sanitary sewer
system. The notice shall direct the owner or his agent to
connect the building to such main in the manner prescribed by
the Building Inspector and to install such facilities as may be
reasonably necessary to permit passage of sewage incidental
to such human habitation into the sewer system to prevent
creation of a health nuisance.
(c) The Village shall provide official notification to such owners of
the requirement to make connection to the sanitary sewer. If
the owner fails to have the connection made, after expiration of
the time provided by the notice, the Village may bring an action
against the owner for violation of this section or may cause
connection to be made by a licensed plumber under the
direction of the Village and charge the cost of such connection
as a special tax against the property.
(d) The owner or his agent may, within 30 days after completion of
the work, file a written option with the Village Treasurer
stating that he cannot pay the cost of connection in one lump
sum and electing that such sum be levied in five equal annual
installments, with interest at the rate of the Village's current
cost of borrowing plus 2% per annum from the date of
completion of the work, to be placed on the tax roll. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]

that the requirement to connect to the Village sanitary sewer
system is necessary for the preservation of public health,
comfort and safety.

this additional revenue to increase the property tax base, improve

licenses.

denial should be reversed. In addition, the notice shall inform the
applicant that the reconsideration of the application shall be held in
closed session, pursuant to § 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., unless the

§ 305-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-17
1:239
§ 305-18. Non-alcohol events for underage persons on licensed
premises.
The presence of underage persons on a licensed premises as provided under
§ 125.07(3)(a)10, Wis. Stats., shall be subject to the following:
proceedings for the revocation of such license may be instituted in the
manner and under the procedure established by this section.
B. Abandonment of business. Any licensee holding a license to sell alcohol
beverages who abandons such business shall forfeit any right or
preference he/she may have to the holding of or renewal of such
license. Abandonment shall be sufficient grounds for revocation of any
alcohol beverage license. The closing of the licensed premises for at
least six months shall be prima facie evidence of the abandonment,
unless extended by the Village Board. All persons issued a license to sell
alcohol beverages in the Village for which a quota exists limiting the
number of such licenses that may be issued by the Village shall cause
such business described in such license to be operated on the premises
described in such license for at least 150 days during the term of such
license, unless such license is issued for a term of less than 180 days, in
which event this subsection shall not apply.
C. License revocation or suspension. License revocation or suspension
procedures shall be as prescribed by Ch. 125, Wis. Stats.
A. The licensee or agent of a corporate licensee shall notify the Police
Department at least 48 hours in advance of the date of any event at
which underage persons will be present on the licensed premises. Each
such non-alcohol event notice shall specify the date(s) on which the
event is to occur and the time(s) of commencement. All notices shall be
filed with the Police Department during normal working hours (8:00
a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday) and shall be given on forms
prescribed by the Village. After a non-alcohol event notice has been
given, the licensee may cancel an event(s) only by giving like notice to
the Police Department in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection. Regardless of the date given, all notices shall expire and be
deemed canceled no later than the date of expiration or revocation of
the applicable retail "Class B" or Class "B" license.
B. During the period of any non-alcohol event, a notice card prescribed by
the Police Department shall be posted at all public entrances to the
licensed premises, notifying the general public that no alcohol
beverages may be consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the
licensed premises during the event. Such notice cards shall be made
available by the Village to a requesting licensee.
C. Once a non-alcohol event has commenced, no alcohol beverages may be
consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the licensed premises
until the next day following the closing hours of the licensed premises.
§ 305-17 EAST TROY CODE § 305-18
1:240
§ 305-19. Nude dancing in licensed establishments.
D. During the period of any non-alcohol event, all alcohol beverages shall
be stored in a locked portion of the licensed premises, in a secure place
out of the sight and physical reach of any patron present, and shall be
under the direct and immediate control and supervision of the licensee
or a licensed bartender in the employ of the licensee. All beer taps and
automatic dispensers of alcohol beverages (speed guns) shall be either
disconnected, disabled or made inoperable.
A. Authority.
(1) The Village Board of the Village of East Troy has explicit authority
under § 125.10(1), Wis. Stats., to adopt regulations governing the
sale of alcohol beverages which are in addition to those set forth in
Ch. 125, Wis. Stats.
(2) The Village Board has the authority under its general police powers
set forth in the Wisconsin Statutes to act for the good order of the
municipality and for the health, safety and welfare of the public and
may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression.
(3) The Village Board recognizes it lacks authority to regulate
obscenity in light of § 66.0107(3), Wis. Stats., and does not intend
by adopting this section to regulate obscenity, since nudity in and of
itself is not obscene. It declares its intent to enact an ordinance
addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, nonobscene,
erotic dancing in bars and taverns.
(4) Bars and taverns featuring live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic
dancing have in other communities tended to further the increase
of criminal and other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and
order of the communities, to depreciate the value of real property,
to harm the economic welfare of the communities, and to
negatively affect the quality of life of the communities, and such
secondary effects are detrimental to the public health, safety and
general welfare of citizens.
(5) The Village Board recognizes the U.S. Supreme Court has held that
nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and
therefore entitled to some limited protection under the First
Amendment, and the governing body further recognizes that
freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly
protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection
of those rights.
(6) However, the Village Board is aware, based on the experiences of
other communities, that bars and taverns in which live, totally
nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing occurs may and do generate
secondary effects which the governing body believes are
§ 305-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-19
1:241
detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the Village of East Troy.
(7) Among these secondary effects are:
(a) The potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related
offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses;
(b) The potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods
where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist;
(c) Health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases; and
(d) The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the
purpose of unlawful conduct.
(8) The Village Board desires to minimize, prevent and control these
adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the citizens of the Village of East Troy; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve
the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of urban blight.
(9) The Village Board has determined that enactment of an ordinance
prohibiting live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing in bars
and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages promotes the goal
of minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative secondary
effects associated with such activity.
B. Nude dancing in licensed establishments prohibited. It is unlawful for
any person to perform or engage in or for any licensee or manager or
agent of the licensee to permit any person, employee, entertainer or
patron to perform or engage in any live act, demonstration, dance or
exhibition on the premises of a licensed establishment which:
(1) Shows his/her genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, anal cleft or
cleavage with less than a fully opaque covering;
(2) Shows any portion of the female breast below a point immediately
above the top of the areola; or
(3) Shows the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.
C. Exemptions. The provisions of this section do not apply to the following
licensed establishments: theaters, performing arts centers, civic
centers and dinner theaters where live dance, ballet, music and
dramatic performances of serious artistic merit are offered on a regular
basis and in which the predominant business or attraction is not the
offering to customers of entertainment which is intended to provide
sexual stimulation or sexual gratification to such customers and where
the establishment is not distinguished by an emphasis on, or the

advertising or promotion of, employees engaging in nude, erotic
dancing.
D. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

Village Board of the Village of East Troy to sell alcohol beverages
pursuant to Ch. 125, Wis. Stats.
LICENSEE  The holder of a retail "Class A," "Class B," Class "B," Class
"A" or "Class C" license granted by the Village Board of the Village of
East Troy pursuant to Ch. 125, Wis. Stats.
E. Penalties. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which violates
any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to a forfeiture
pursuant to § 1-4 of this Code. A separate offense and violation shall be
deemed committed on each day on which a violation occurs or
continues. In addition, violation of this section constitutes sufficient
grounds for suspending, revoking or nonrenewing an alcohol beverage
license under § 125.12, Wis. Stats.
A. Application for license.149
(1) The Village Board may issue an operator's license, which license
shall be granted only upon application, in writing, on forms to be
obtained from the Village Clerk only to persons 18 years of age or
older. An operator's license shall be operative only within the limits
of the Village. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(2) All applications are subject to an investigation by the Police
Department and/or other appropriate authority to determine
whether the applicant and/or premises to be licensed complies with
all regulations, ordinances and laws applicable thereto. The
investigating authority shall conduct an investigation of the
applicant, including but not limited to requesting information from
the state, surrounding municipalities and/or any community where
the applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's
arrest and conviction record. Based upon such investigation, the
investigating authority shall recommend, in writing, to the Village
Board approval or denial of the application. If the investigating
authority recommends denial, the investigating authority shall
provide, in writing, the reasons for such recommendation.
B. Duration. Licenses issued under the provisions of this section shall be
valid for a period of two years and shall expire on the 30th day of June.
C. Operator's license fee; provisional or temporary licenses.
149. Editor's Note: Original § 7-2-30, Operator's license required, which immediately preceded
this subsection, was repealed 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02.
§ 305-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-20
1:243
(1) Fee. The fee for an operator's license shall be set by the Village
Board for a two-year term or part thereof. The fees for a provisional
operator's license and a temporary operator's license shall be set
by the Village Board. There shall be an additional nonrefundable
investigative fee set by the Village Board added to the fee for all
three licenses to cover the State of Wisconsin charges. Any person
applying for an operator's license within a one-year period after
having been denied an operator's license shall forfeit all fees if the
operator's license is denied again. [Amended 4-1-2013 by Ord.
No. 2013-01; 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02]
(2) Provisional license. The Village Clerk may issue a provisional
operator's license in accordance with § 125.17(5), Wis. Stats. The
provisional operator's license shall expire 60 days after its issuance
or when an operator's license is issued to the holder, whichever is
sooner. The Chief of Police shall submit to the Village Clerk a report
regarding the applicant's conviction history, if any. The applicant
for such provisional license must present evidence to
the Clerk establishing that the applicant is enrolled in a
responsible beverage server training course established pursuant
to § 125.17(6), Wis. Stats. The Village Clerk may, upon receiving an
application for a provisional license, issue such a license without
requiring the successful completion of the approved training
course as described herein. However, such provisional license shall
be used only for the purpose of allowing such applicant the
privilege of being licensed as a beverage operator pending his/her
successful completion of the approved training course and the
Village approval process to allow for the applicant to obtain a
regular operator's license. A provisional license may not be issued
to any person who has been denied an operator's license by the
Village Board, who has had his/her operator's license revoked or
suspended within the preceding 12 months, or who previously held
a provisional operator's license and who failed to complete the
responsible beverage server training course. The
Village Clerk shall provide an appropriate application form to be
completed in full by the applicant. The Village Clerk may revoke
the provisional license issued if he/she discovers that the holder of
the license made a false statement on the application. A provisional
license shall not be renewed. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No.
2015-02; 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(3) Temporary license.
(a) The Village Clerk may issue a temporary operator's license,
provided that: [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
[1] This license may be issued only to operators employed by,
or donating their services to, nonprofit corporations.
[2] No person may hold more than one license of this kind per
year.
§ 305-20 EAST TROY CODE § 305-20
1:244
(b) The license is valid for any period from one day to 14 days, and
the period for which it is valid shall be stated on the license.
D. Issuance or denial of operator's license.
(1) After the Village Board approves the granting of an operator's
license, the Village Clerk shall issue the license. Such licenses shall
be issued and numbered in the order they are granted and shall
give the applicant's name, address and the date of the expiration of
such license. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(2) Denial and reconsideration. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-18]
(a) If the application is denied by the Village Board, the
Village Clerk shall, in writing, inform the applicant of the
denial, the reasons therefor, and of the opportunity to request
a reconsideration of the application by the Village Board in a
closed session. Such notice must be sent by registered mail to,
or served upon, the applicant at least 10 days prior to the
Board's reconsideration of the matter. At such reconsideration
hearing, the applicant may present evidence and testimony as
to why the license should be granted.
(b) If, upon reconsideration, the Board again denies the
application, the Village Clerk shall notify the applicant, in
writing, of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is denied any
license upon reconsideration of the matter may apply to the
Circuit Court, pursuant to § 125.12(2)(d), Wis. Stats., for
review.
(3) Considerations for granting license.
(a) Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be
based on:
[1] Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to
the limitations imposed by §§ 111.321, 111.322 and
111.335, Wis. Stats.;
[2] The financial responsibility of the applicant;
[3] The appropriateness of the location and the premises
where the licensed business is to be conducted; and
[4] Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be
reposed.
(b) If a licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to
the licensed activity, the Village Board may act to revoke or
suspend the license.
§ 305-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 305-20
1:245
(4) An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and
conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony
(unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a law
offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been
a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction
of at least two offenses which are substantially related to the
licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding the
license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of
which is a right granted solely to the Village Board, the Village
Board reserves the right to consider the severity and facts and
circumstances of the offense when making the determination to
grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Village Board, at its
discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or
more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed
activity within the five years immediately preceding, act to suspend
such license for a period of one year or more.
E. Training course.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection F(2) below, the Village Board may
not issue an operator's license unless the applicant has successfully
completed the training course as described in § 125.17(6), Wis.
Stats., unless the applicant fulfills one of the following
requirements:150
(a) The person is renewing an operator's license.
(b) Within the past two years, the person held a Class "A," Class
"B," "Class A," "Class B" or "Class C" license or permit, or a
manager's or operator's license.
(c) Within the past two years, the person has completed such a
training course.
(2) The Village Board may issue a provisional operator's license to a
person who is enrolled in a training course under Subsection E(1)
above and shall revoke that license if the applicant fails
successfully to complete the course in which he/she enrolls.
(3) The Village Board may not require that applicants for an operator's
license undergo training in addition to that under Subsection E(1)
but may require applicants to purchase, at cost, materials that deal
with relevant local subjects not covered in the course under
Subsection E(1).
F. Display of license. Each license issued under the provisions of this
section shall be posted on the premises whenever the operator
dispenses beverages or be in his possession or the licensee shall carry a
license card.151

G. Revocation of operator's license. Violation of any of the terms or
provisions of the state law or of this article relating to operators'
licenses by any person holding such operator's license shall be cause
for revocation of the license.
A. Forfeitures for violations of §§ 125.07(1) to (4) and 125.09(2), Wis.
Stats., adopted by reference in § 305-1 of this article, shall conform to
the forfeiture penalty permitted to be imposed for violations of the
comparable state statute, including any variations or increases for
subsequent offenses.
B. Any person who shall violate any provision of this article, except as
otherwise provided in Subsection A herein, or who shall conduct any
activity or make any sale for which a license is required without a
license, shall be subject to a forfeiture as provided in § 1-4 of this Code.
C. Nothing herein shall preclude or affect the power of the sentencing
court to exercise additional authorities granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes.

B. Prohibitions. It is the intent of the Village of East Troy, in its adoption of
this provision, to protect against the following activities in a manner
consistent with that provided by § 941.37, Wis. Stats. The following acts
are prohibited and perpetration thereof subjects the violator to penalty

than to report a bona fide emergency or to make a bona fide
request for emergency services.
A. Purpose and intent.
(1) The Village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious
threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter
society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender
to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high
rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity
and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense,
there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in
public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law
near schools and day-care centers. The Village finds and declares
§ 366-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 366-20
1:295
that, in addition to schools and day-care centers, children
congregate or play in a number of public places, including public
parks and other facilities for children.
(2) This section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health
and safety of children in East Troy from the risk that convicted sex
offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. It is
the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but rather
to serve the Village's compelling interest to promote, protect, and
improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village
by creating areas around locations where children regularly
congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual
offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing
temporary or permanent residence and by creating child safety
zones where children regularly congregate in concentrated
numbers wherein access by certain sexual offenders and sexual
predators to such zones shall be restricted or excluded.

B. Possession without consent prohibited. Whoever intentionally takes and

last known address of the person with the overdue material; the notice
date shall be the date of mailing.177
C. Concealment. The concealment of library material beyond the last
station for borrowing library material in a library is evidence of intent
to deprive the library of possession of the material. The discovery of
library material which has not been borrowed in accordance with the
library's procedures or taken with consent of a library official, agent or
employee, and which is concealed upon the person or among the
belongings of another, is evidence of intentional concealment on the
part of the person so concealing the material.

the purpose of the detention and be permitted to make telephone calls
but shall not be interrogated or searched against his/her will before
the arrival of a law enforcement officer who may conduct a lawful
interrogation of the accused person. Compliance with this subsection
entitles the official, agent or employee effecting the detention to the
same defense in any action as is available to a peace officer making an
arrest in the line of duty.
E. Damaging material prohibited. No person shall mar, deface or in any
other way damage or mutilate any book, periodical, pamphlet, picture

A. Whomever intentionally alters indicia of price or value of merchandise,
or takes and carries away, transfers, conceals or retains possession of
merchandise held for resale by a merchant, without consent and with
intent to deprive the merchant permanently of possession or the full
purchase price, may be penalized as provided in Subsection D.
B. The intentional concealment of unpurchased merchandise which
continues from one floor to another, or beyond the last station for
receiving payments in a merchant's store, is evidence of intent to
deprive the merchant permanently of possession of such merchandise
without paying the purchase price thereof. The discovery of
unpurchased merchandise concealed upon the person or among the
belongings of another is evidence of intentional concealment on the
part of the person so concealing such goods.

guardian, if a minor. The detained person must be promptly informed of
the purpose for the detention and may make phone calls, but he/she
shall not be interrogated or searched against his/her will before the
arrival of a law enforcement officer who may conduct a lawful
interrogation of the accused person. Compliance with this subsection
entitles the merchant or his/her employee effecting the detention to the
same defense in any action as is available to a peace officer making an
arrest in the line of duty.
D. If the value of the merchandise does not exceed $500, any person
violating this section shall forfeit not more than $1,000. If the value of
the merchandise exceeds $500, this section shall not apply and the

pay restitution to a victim. In determining the method of payment,
the Court shall consider the financial resources and future ability of
the violator to pay. The Court shall provide for payment of an
amount equal to the pecuniary loss caused by the offense. Upon the
application of an interested party, the Court shall schedule and hold
an evidentiary hearing to determine the value of the victim's
pecuniary loss resulting from the offense. A victim may not be
compensated under this section and under § 943.245, Wis. Stats.
(2) In this section, "pecuniary loss" means:
(a) All special damages, but not general damages, substantiated
by evidence in the record, which a person could recover
against the violator in a civil action arising out of the facts or
events constituting the violator's criminal activities, including,

or
(2) Issues any check, money order or any other form of bank or
monetary draft as a payment of rent, where such document lacks

ARTICLE I
Minimum Standards
[Adopted 4-3-2000 by Ord. No. 2000-2 as Title 15, Ch. 4, of the 2000
Code]
§ 375-1. Minimum property maintenance standards.
§ 375-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall be applicable:
ABANDONED DWELLING  A dwelling which is not occupied and which
is not intended by the owner to be occupied within a reasonable period
of time. A dwelling shall be presumed to be abandoned if it is unoccupied
for a period of 12 consecutive months. Occupancy required hereunder
shall be bona fide and not acquired for the sole purpose of defeating the
abandonment of a dwelling.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE  A structure, the use of which is incidental to
that of the main building and which is attached thereto or located on the
same premises.
BLIGHTED AREA  Any area (including a slum area) in which a majority
of the structures are residential (or in which there is a predominance
of buildings or improvements, whether residential or nonresidential) and
which, by reason of dilapidation, deterioration, age or obsolescence,
inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation or open spaces,
high density of population and overcrowding, or the existence of conditions
which endanger life or property by fire and other causes, or any
A. Policy. There exist in the Village of East Troy structures, residential
yards or vacant areas or combinations thereof which are, or may
become, unhygienic, dilapidated or unsafe with respect to structural
integrity, equipment or maintenance and as such constitute a menace to
the health, safety and welfare of the public. Lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration of certain properties have the further effect
of creating blighted area conditions, and, if such conditions are not
curtailed and removed, the expenditure of large amounts of public
funds to correct and eliminate the same will be necessary. Timely
regulation and restriction to contain and prevent blight is necessary,
thereby maintaining the desirability and amenities, as well as property
values, of the neighborhoods in the Village.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect public health, safety
and welfare by establishing minimum property maintenance standards.
This article does not replace or modify standards otherwise established
by other portions of this Code of Ordinances for construction, repair,
alteration or use of buildings. This article is meant to be remedial, and
this article shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes stated
herein. Violation of the minimum standards set forth in this article shall
be deemed to be a public nuisance.

BUILDING  Any structure built for the support, shelter and enclosure of
persons, animals, chattels or movable property of any kind and which is
permanently affixed to the land or connected to a utility, and includes those
structures resting on runners, wheels, or similar supports.
DETERIORATION  The condition or appearance of a building or part
thereof characterized by holes, breaks, rot, crumbling, cracking, peeling,
rusting or other evidence of physical decay, neglect, lack of maintenance or
excessive use.
DILAPIDATED  Describes a building, structure or part thereof which is in
a state of ruin or shabbiness resulting from neglect. The term applies to a
hazard to life or property.
DWELLING  Any enclosed space which is wholly or partly used or
intended to be used for living or sleeping by human occupants.
NUISANCE  Any public nuisance known at common law or in equity
jurisprudence or as provided by the statutes of the State of Wisconsin or
the Village of East Troy Code of Ordinances. Further, a public nuisance is a
thing, act, occupation, condition or use of property which shall continue for
such length of time as to:
OCCUPANT  Any person living or sleeping in or having actual possession
of a building.
OWNER  Any person who, alone or jointly or severally with others:
PERSON  Any natural individual, firm, trust, partnership, association or
corporation.
PREMISES  A platted lot or part thereof or unplatted lot or parcel of land
or plot of land, either occupied or unoccupied by a dwelling or nondwelling

of rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto to the same extent as
if he/she were the owner.

ARTICLE III
Service to Outside Users
§ 400-11. Provision of service.
The Village may provide wastewater treatment service to persons located
outside of the Village of East Troy corporate limits, provided that said
person's property is contained within the approved sanitary sewer service
area. Additionally, the Village may provide wastewater treatment service to
persons located outside of the Village of East Troy sanitary sewer service
area either by establishment of a service agreement or by annexation of the
person's property into the sanitary sewer service area. The Village reserves
the right to refuse service to any and all persons requesting service for
properties located outside of the existing sanitary sewer service area.
§ 400-12. Authority to establish agreements.
The Village shall have the authority to establish agreements with persons
located outside of the Village of East Troy corporate limits (outside users),
in accordance with Chapter 66 of the Wisconsin Statutes, for the purpose of
providing wastewater treatment service to such persons.
§ 400-13. General conditions of agreements.
In addition to any rules, regulations, limitations, conditions, charges, or
other provisions set forth in the agreement between the outside user and
the Village, the following general conditions shall apply to all agreements
with outside users:
A. Agreements with outside users shall not be made unless the Village
determines that adequate excess treatment capacity exists to provide
service to said outside user, or unless said outside user agrees to pay all
costs associated with upgrading the wastewater facilities to provide the
additional capacity required.
B. The agreement shall establish the allowable wastewater flows, loads,
and wastewater characteristics which the outside user will be allowed
to discharge to the wastewater facilities; shall establish other
conditions and limitations as required to protect the wastewater
facilities and the proper operation thereof; shall establish the period of
time for which the agreement will be valid; and shall establish penalties
for violation of any of the provisions of the service agreement.
C. Under all agreements, the outside user shall pay an equitable portion of
the Village of East Troy wastewater facilities debt service charge cost
and user charge costs. The methodology for calculating the allocation of
costs to outside users shall be as indicated in Article XIV of this chapter.
D. The agreement shall assure continued outside user participation in debt
service charge costs over the life of the agreement. The Village may
require the outside user to pay its share of the wastewater facilities
§ 400-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-13
1:335
debt service charge costs prior to connection to the wastewater
facilities. Alternatively, the Village may bill the outside user for its
share of the debt service charge costs and associated financing and
administration costs on a quarterly basis. Should the outside user
eliminate its discharge, the Village, at its option, may elect to assign
to another user that portion of the design capacity of the wastewater
facilities and associated debt service charge costs, thereby relieving the
outside user of continued financial participation.
E. In addition to any rules, regulations, requirements, restrictions, or
provisions provided in the agreement between the outside user and the
Village, the outside user shall be subject to the rules and regulations
provided in this chapter, as applicable.
F. All municipal outside users shall incorporate into their sewer use
ordinance the rules and regulations provided in this chapter, as may be
modified or amended from time to time.
G. The method of connection of the outside user's wastewater collection
system to the Village of East Troy wastewater facilities shall be as
specified by the Village.
H. For all outside users, facilities shall be provided to allow flow
measurement and sampling of the wastewater discharged by the
outside user to the Village wastewater facilities. The construction,
operation, and monitoring requirements for said facilities shall be
consistent with the requirements of § 400-60, Control manholes, flow
monitoring and wastewater sampling, of this chapter. Flow meters shall
be calibrated a minimum of one time per year by a factory-authorized
technician. The costs for installation, operation, and maintenance of
said facilities shall be borne in their entirety by the outside user. Plans
and specifications for said facilities shall be submitted to the Village for
review and approval.
I. All outside users shall limit expansion and growth as required to
maintain their wastewater discharge within the flow and/or load
allocations stated in their agreement with the Village. Any outside user
which exceeds it allocated flows and/or load capacity shall be subject to
fines, penalties, and surcharges as stated in its agreement with the
Village or, where the agreement does not specify fines, penalties, and
surcharges, as provided for in this chapter.
J. An outside user may request additional capacity from the Village to
accommodate anticipated expansion or growth. If capacity is available,
and the Village is willing to reallocate the requested capacity to the
user, then the agreement between the outside user and the Village shall
be amended to indicate the change in the allocated capacity. In all
cases, outside users obtaining additional capacity from the Village shall
be required to pay an additional share of the wastewater facilities debt
service charge costs. If there is no available capacity, or the Village is
not willing to reallocate the available capacity, then the outside user
§ 400-13 EAST TROY CODE § 400-13
1:336
may request that the Village upgrade the wastewater facilities to
provide the additional requested capacity, with all cost of the upgrades
being charged to the outside user. The right to obtain additional
capacity is not guaranteed to any outside user.
K. Outside users shall maintain, inspect, and repair their sanitary sewers
as required to limit infiltration and inflow to nonexcessive levels.
Infiltration shall be considered excessive if the highest average flow, for
the outside user, recorded over a fourteen-day period, under seasonal
high groundwater and dry weather conditions, exceeds 120 gallons per
capita per day or the equivalent thereof. Combined inflow and
infiltration shall be considered excessive if the maximum day flow for
the outside user exceeds 275 gallons per capita per day or the
equivalent thereof. The Village may impose fines, penalties, and
surcharges for excessive infiltration and/or excess infiltration and
inflow; said charges shall be in addition to the sewer service charges
applied to the outside user.
L. In the event that the Village of East Troy wastewater facilities need to
be upgraded at any time in the future, all outside users shall be
required to pay an equitable share of the costs of such upgrades. The
cost allocation to the outside user for such costs shall be consistent with
the methodology provided in Article XIV of this chapter. Outside users
shall be required to contribute to the cost of any wastewater facilities
upgrades associated with permit compliance, replacement of aging
structures or equipment, or any other upgrades which the outside user,
directly or indirectly, benefits from. Outside users shall not be required
to contribute to any costs associated with those components of a
wastewater treatment facilities upgrade which are solely associated
with provision of additional treatment capacity for users located in the
Village of East Troy and from which said outside user receives no direct
or indirect benefit.
M. No outside user shall allow an industrial user to connect to its
wastewater collection system without written approval from the
Village. The requirements of Article VII, Control of Industrial
Wastewater Discharged to Wastewater Facilities, of this chapter shall
apply to all industrial users discharging to the Village wastewater
facilities either directly or indirectly through the wastewater collection
system of an outside user.
N. No outside user shall allow septage, holding tank waste, or other
hauled wastes to be discharged into its wastewater collection system
without written permission from the Village.
O. No outside user shall accept wastewater from any user located outside
of the service area for said outside user as defined in the agreement
with the Village.
P. Proposals for all sanitary sewer extensions to the wastewater collection
systems of outside users shall be submitted to the Village for review and
§ 400-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-13
1:337
approval. Where sanitary sewer extension proposals are approved by
the Village, plans and specifications for the sanitary sewer extension
shall be submitted to the Village for review and approval. Submittal
requirements shall be as indicated in Article VI of this chapter.
Q. Outside users shall not expand their sanitary sewer service areas
without approval from the Village. The outside user shall submit a
proposal for expansion of the sanitary sewer service area to the Village
for review and approval. The proposal shall include sufficient
information to verify that the additional flow from said extension will
not result in exceedance of the outside user's flow allocation as defined
in the agreement with the Village. In addition, Village approval of any
sanitary sewer service area expansion shall be contingent on approval
of the expansion by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning
Commission.
R. Outside users shall, in all cases, submit written notification to the
Village in the event that the property covered under an agreement with
the Village is sold or transferred to another person.
S. In the event that an outside user sells or transfers the property covered
under an agreement with the Village to another person, then the
agreement, in principle, between the Village and the original outside
user shall be transferable to the person receiving said property,
provided that the use of the property will remain substantially the
same. However, the Village shall require that a new agreement be
executed with the new owner of said property providing a signature on
said agreement. The person receiving the property shall be bound by
the conditions of the agreement with the Village. In the event that the
use of the property is changed by the person receiving the property,
such that the quantity or characteristics of the wastewater discharged
will be changed, then the Village may require that a new agreement be
executed with the person who received the property, with revised
conditions and restrictions as deemed appropriate by the Village.
Alternatively, the Village may deny service to said person if insufficient
capacity exists to accommodate the increased wastewater flows or
loads or if, in the opinion of the Village, said wastewater could
adversely impact the operation, maintenance, or performance of the
wastewater facilities.
T. Nothing in this chapter, or any agreement between the Village and an
outside user, shall be construed as granting the outside user ownership
of any part of the Village of East Troy wastewater facilities or a voice in
the government of the wastewater facilities.
U. In the event that wastewater from an outside user's wastewater
collection system results in odor nuisance in, or corrosion of, the
Village's wastewater facilities, then the Village may require the outside
user to install facilities to remedy the problem or the Village may install
said facilities and charge the cost to the outside user.

ARTICLE IV
Use of Wastewater Facilities
§ 400-14. User rules and regulations.
The rules and regulations as set forth in this chapter shall be considered
a part of the contract with every person who is connected with the
wastewater facilities, and every such person, by connecting with the
wastewater facilities, shall be considered as expressing his or her assent
to be bound thereby. Whenever any of said rules and regulations, or such
others as the Village may hereafter adopt, are violated by any person, said
person shall be subject to the penalties, fines, and actions as provided for
under this chapter.
§ 400-15. Prohibitions on discharge of storm drainage and
groundwater.
No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted
waters, including but not limited to stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff,
basement sump pump discharge, foundation drain discharge, subsurface
drainage, or cooling water, to the wastewater collection system, except that
stormwater runoff from limited areas, which stormwater may be polluted
at times, may be discharged to the wastewater collection system by
permission of the Village. Such approval will be considered by the Village
only when no reasonable alternate method of disposal is available.
Applicable charges and limitations for such discharge to the wastewater
collection system shall be determined by the Village. Any user determined
to be discharging unpolluted waters to the wastewater collection system
without written approval from the Village shall be issued a notice to
permanently disconnect and abandon, within 14 days, any piping or
facilities which enable such discharge. Failure to disconnect after such
notice shall authorize the Village to have the piping and facilities
disconnected and assess the costs of such disconnection against the
property involved. The Village shall have the alternative right, at the end
of such notice, to institute court proceedings for violation of this chapter,
including assessment of fines.
§ 400-16. Storm sewers.
Stormwater and all other unpolluted water shall be discharged to such
sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers or to a natural
outlet approved by the Village and other applicable regulatory agencies
with authority over such discharges. Unpolluted industrial cooling water
or process waters may be discharged, with approval from the Village and
other applicable regulatory agencies with authority over such discharges,
to a storm sewer or natural outlet.

such discharge.
B. The Village may alter, amend, or modify the limitations indicated above
if it determines it is necessary to do so to meet the objectives of this
chapter or to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.
A. If any user proposes a discharge to the wastewater facilities containing
any substances, materials, liquids, wastewater, waters, or wastes in
excess of any of the limitations listed above, the user shall submit to the
Village, in writing, a request to allow exceedance of the limitations on
discharge characteristics as set forth in this chapter. The Village, or its
agent, shall evaluate the request based on information which shall be
provided by the user, including the proposed discharge flows and
characteristics. The cost for the Village to evaluate the potential effects
of the proposed discharge on the wastewater facilities shall be borne in
its entirety by the proposed discharger. Upon completion of its
evaluation, the Village may, in exercise of reasonable discretion:
(1) Reject the wastewater;

without written permission from the Village.
§ 400-22. User to allow wastewater sampling.
The Village may sample, or cause to be sampled, wastewater discharged
by any user when, in the opinion of the Village, there is reason to believe
that the user may be discharging wastewater containing any substances or
having any characteristics prohibited under this chapter or containing any
substances or having any characteristics in excess of those allowed under
the requirements of this chapter. The user shall grant the Village, or its
authorized representative, access to the user's facilities for the purpose of
collecting such samples. If the user is found to be discharging wastewater
which is in violation of any provision of this chapter, then the user shall pay
the costs of the collection and analysis of the samples and shall additionally
be subject to any fines or penalties as provided for in this chapter.
§ 400-23. Increased discharges.
(4) Recover the costs of handling and treating such wastewater from
the user discharging the waste.

to making any such modifications. The request shall provide a detailed
description of the proposed changes along with an estimate of the
impact of the changes on wastewater flows and loads. The Village, or its
Engineer, shall evaluate the request. Upon completion of its evaluation,
the Village may, in exercise of its discretion:
(1) Reject the request;
(2) Approve the request as submitted; or
(3) Approve the request with conditions and limitations.
B. In all cases, the sewer service charge to the user shall be increased by
an amount as determined by the Village in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
A. Grease and oil separators and sand interceptors shall be provided, at
the user's cost, when in the opinion of the Village they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease or oil in excess
of the limitations set forth in this chapter, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors and
separators shall not be required for residential users.
B. All separators and interceptors shall be of the type and capacity
approved by the WDNR and/or the Wisconsin Department of Safety and
Professional Services and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Plans, specifications, and other
pertinent information for all grease and oil separators and sand
interceptors shall be submitted to the Village for review prior to

ARTICLE XIV
Basis for Sewer Service Charges
§ 400-86. Charges levied and assessed.
There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building,
premises, unit, or user having a connection with the wastewater facilities
a sewer service charge pursuant to § 66.0821, Wis. Stats., as amended
from time to time. The sewer service charge shall consist of a fixed debt
service charge and a variable user charge. The debt service charge shall be
based on the annual payment of principal and interest for the retirement of
debt issued to finance the cost of capital improvements to the wastewater
facilities and the cost associated with the administration of said debt. The
user charge shall be based on the costs of the operation and maintenance
of the wastewater facilities and on the cost of the annual contribution to the
replacement fund.
§ 400-87. General methodology for allocation of sewer service
charges.
A. It is the intent of the Village of East Troy to provide equitable
distribution of sewer service charge costs to all users of the wastewater
facilities. The following general methodology will be applied in
determining the allocation of the debt service costs and the user charge
costs to the users within the Village of East Troy sewer service area and
to all outside users:
(1) The total debt service cost associated with the wastewater
treatment plant shall be distributed to the Village of East Troy and
to outside users in direct proportion to the allocation of the
wastewater treatment plant total flow capacity among said entities.
Said debt service cost allocation to outside users shall be in
accordance with the methodology provided in § 400-89A of this
chapter.
(2) The total debt service cost associated with the Village of East Troy
wastewater collection system shall be allocated to the Village of
East Troy, with the exception that the Village may allocate a portion
of said cost to outside users when the wastewater flow from an
outside user is conveyed through any part of the Village of East
Troy wastewater collection system in route to the wastewater
treatment plant. Said debt service cost allocation to outside users
shall be in accordance with the methodology provided in § 400-89A
of this chapter.
(3) The total user charge cost associated with the wastewater
treatment plant shall be distributed to the Village of East Troy and
to outside users in direct proportion to metered wastewater flow.
Said user charge cost allocation to outside users shall be in
accordance with the methodology provided in § 400-89B of this
chapter.
§ 400-86 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-87
1:381
§ 400-88. Sewer service charges for users in Village sewer service
area.
(4) The total user charge cost associated with the Village of East Troy
wastewater collection system shall be allocated to the Village of
East Troy, with the exception that the Village may allocate a portion
of said costs to outside users where the wastewater flow from an
outside user is conveyed through any part of the Village of East
Troy wastewater collection system in route to the wastewater
treatment plant. Said user charge cost allocation to outside users
shall be in accordance with the methodology provided in § 400-89B
of this chapter.
B. Section 400-88 of this chapter describes the methodology to be applied
in calculating the sewer service charges for users located in the Village
of East Troy sanitary sewer service area with the exception of users
classified as outside users by the Village. Section 400-89 of this chapter
describes the methodology to be applied in calculating the sewer
service charges for outside users.
A. Applicable users. This section applies to all users within the Village of
East Troy sewer service area with the exception of users defined in this
chapter as, or classified by the Village as, outside users.
B. Users served by Water Utility meters. Where users procure all of their
water solely from the Water Utility, the debt service component of the
sewer service charge shall be based on the size of the user's Water
Utility water meter and the user charge component of the sewer service
charge shall be based on the quantity of water usage as measured by
the Water Utility water meter(s) installed on the user's premises.
C. Users served by private wells.
(1) If any person discharging wastewater to the wastewater facilities
procures part, or all, of his water from sources other than the Water
Utility, all or part of which is discharged to the wastewater
facilities, the person shall have water meters installed on all
sources, by the Village, at the person's expense, for the purpose of
determining the volume of water used for assessing the user
charge component of the sewer service charge. Where required,
for the purposes of determining the debt service charge applicable
to the user, the Village shall assign an equivalent meter factor to
said user, based on the average daily total metered water usage by
the user relative to one residential user flow equivalent.
(2) Where water meters are required to be installed, the water meters
shall be furnished and installed by the Village. All costs for the
installation of the water meters shall be at the expense of the
person requiring the water meter. The Water Utility will charge for
each meter a rental charge as set by the Public Service Commission
§ 400-87 EAST TROY CODE § 400-88
1:382
to compensate for the cost of furnishing the meter and servicing
the meter.
(3) Where the installation of building sewer flow meters is approved by
the Village, the Village will allow the use of readings from such
meters for the purpose of assessing the user charge to said user
and will waive the requirement to install water meters on sources
other than the Water Utility. For the purposes of assessing the user
charge to said users, the metered wastewater flow shall be
assumed to be equivalent to metered water usage. Where required,
for the purposes of determining the debt service charge applicable
to the user, the Village shall assign an equivalent meter factor to
said user, based on the average daily total metered wastewater
discharged by the user relative to one residential user flow
equivalent. All building sewer meters shall be installed by a
licensed plumber while a representative of the Village is present to
observe and inspect said installation. Only Village-approved
building sewer meters will be allowed. All building sewer flow
meters shall be installed and maintained at the expense of the user,
or at the expense of the Sewer Utility with approval by the Director
of Public Works.195
D. Deduct meters.
(1) If a commercial, industrial, institutional, or governmental user
believes that a significant volume of metered water is not
discharged to the wastewater facilities, said user can, at its own
expense, with approval from the Village, install such additional
meters, metered services, or building sewer flow meters as
required to establish the volume of metered water not discharged
to the wastewater facilities or the actual volume of wastewater
discharged to the wastewater facilities. Metered water that is not
discharged to the wastewater facilities shall not be subject to sewer
service charges.
(2) All requests to install additional water meters, meter services, or
building sewer meters shall be made in writing to the Village. The
request shall clearly state the reasons why the user believes these
facilities are needed and shall include a detailed description of the
facilities proposed. No water meters, meter services, or building
sewer meters may be installed without written approval from the
Village.
(3) All building sewer meters shall be installed by a licensed plumber
while a representative of the Village is present to observe and
inspect said installation. Only Village-approved building sewer
meters will be allowed. All deduct water meters shall be furnished
and installed by the Village. The user shall be charged for each
195. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 400-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-88
1:383
deduct meter a rental charge as approved by the Public Service
Commission to compensate for the cost of furnishing the meter and
servicing the meter. All costs for the installation of the meters shall
be at the expense of the user requiring the meter.
E. Residential summer irrigation allowance. The user charge for all
residential users, with metered water service, shall be calculated to
provide an allowance for metered water that is used for outside
purposes (watering lawns, washing cars, etc.) and that is, consequently,
not discharged to the sanitary sewer. The irrigation allowance will be
applied for the second and third quarters of the year. The irrigation
allowance will be calculated as follows:
(1) For each individual residential user, the metered water use for the
fourth quarter of the previous year and the first quarter of the
current year will be averaged ("first/fourth quarter average").
(2) For the second and third quarters of the year, the metered water
usage, for the purposes of calculating the user charge, shall be
based on the lesser of the actual metered water usage or 110% of
the calculated first/fourth quarter average usage; the user charge
will not apply to any metered water usage exceeding 110% of the
calculated "first/fourth quarter average usage.
(3) For the first and fourth quarters of each year, the user charge for
each residential user shall be based on actual metered water
usage.
F. Sewer service charge methodology.
(1) The debt service charge rate (RDS) shall be calculated as the
Village of East Troy's allocation of the total annual debt service cost
divided by the total number of equivalent meters in the Village of
East Troy sewer service area, as follows:
RDS
=
(CVDS)
(NEM)
Where:
RDS = Annual debt service charge rate for users within
the Village of East Troy, dollars per year per
equivalent meter
CVDS = Village of East Troy's allocation of the total annual
debt service cost, dollars per year
NEM = Total number of equivalent meters in the Village
of East Troy
§ 400-88 EAST TROY CODE § 400-88
1:384
(a) The debt service charge (SDS), for each user, shall be
calculated as the debt service charge rate (RDS) multiplied by
the equivalent meter factor (FEM) applicable for each user
based on the size of each user's water meter, as follows:
SDS = (RDS) x (FEM)
(b) Determination of the number of equivalent meters (NEM) and
the equivalent meter factors (FEM) shall be based on the
following schedule:

(2) The user charge rate (RUC) shall be calculated as the Village of
East Troy's allocation of the total annual costs for administration,
management, operation, and maintenance of the wastewater
facilities (COM), and the Village of East Troy's allocation of the
annual contribution to the replacement fund (CRF), divided by the
total annual billed water volume (VT) in thousands of gallons. The
value of VT shall be defined as the total annual volume of water
invoiced by the Water Utility (VI) minus the water volume
discounted for all deduct meters (VDM) and minus the water
volume discounted through the summer irrigation allowance
(VSIA). In equation form, the user charge rate calculation is as
follows:
RUC =
(COM) +
(CRF)
(VT)
VT = VI - VDM - VSIA
§ 400-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-88
1:385
Where:
RUC = Annual user charge rate for users within the Village
of East Troy, dollars per thousand gallons of
metered water
COM = Village of East Troy's allocation of the total annual
cost for administration, management, operation,
and maintenance of the wastewater facilities,
dollars
CRF = Village of East Troy's allocation of the total annual
contribution to the replacement fund, dollars
VT = Annual billed water volume, in thousands of gallons
of metered water

Utility, thousand gallons per year
VDM = Annual volume of water discounted for all deduct
meters, thousand gallons per year
VSIA = Annual volume of water discounted for the summer
residential irrigation allowance, thousand gallons
per year
(a) The user charge (SUC), for each user, shall be calculated as the
user charge rate (RUC) multiplied by the volume of metered
water (VM) recorded for the user, as follows:
SUC = (RUC) x (VM)
Where:
VM = Metered water volume in thousands of gallons
(b) For residential users, the metered water volume (VM) shall be
calculated as follows:
[1] For the first and fourth quarters of the year, VM shall equal
the actual metered water volume for the user.
[2] For the second and third quarters of the year, VM shall be
the lesser of the actual metered water volume for the
quarter or 110% of the average metered water volume, for
the user, for the fourth quarter of the previous year and
the first quarter of the current year ("first/fourth quarter
average").
(c) For users with Village-approved deduct meters, the metered
water volume (VM) shall be calculated as the total volume of
water metered for the user by all water meters in operation
minus the water volume measured by the deduct meter(s).

§ 400-89. Sewer service charges for outside users.
(d) For users with Village-approved wastewater building sewer
flow meters, the metered wastewater volume shall be used as
for billing purposes (VM).
(e) For all other metered users, the metered water volume (VM)
shall be equal to the actual metered water volume.
(3) The sewer service charge (SSC) for each user shall equal the sum
of the debt service charge (SUC) and the user charge (SUC):
SSC = (SDS) + (SUC)
(4) There shall be a minimum sewer service charge (SM) which shall
be paid by all users connected to the wastewater facilities whether
the user discharges wastewater to the wastewater facilities during
the current billing cycle or not. The purpose of the minimum sewer
service charge is to ensure collection of sufficient funds for
financing of the debt service charge. The minimum charge shall be
calculated as follows:
SM = SDS
Where:
SM = Minimum service sewer charge, in dollars
SDS = Debt service charge, in dollars
(5) Current debt service charge rates and user charge rates, for the
users within the Village of East Troy, are published in the Schedule
of Sewer Service Charge Rates. This schedule is on file, and
available for public viewing, in the Village Clerk-Treasurer's office.
A. Debt service charges.
(1) All outside users shall be required to pay an equitable portion of
the debt service cost. The Village may, at its discretion, require
outside users to pay their allocation of any debt service cost as a
single lump sum payable at the time the wastewater facilities
upgrade or modifications, resulting in said debt service costs, are
constructed, or at such time thereafter that said user connects to
the wastewater facilities. Alternately, the Village may, at its
discretion, finance the outside user's allocation of the debt service
cost jointly with the Village's allocation of the debt service cost and
bill the outside user on a monthly or quarterly basis for said outside
user's share of the debt service cost, including any applicable
finance charges and administration costs.
(2) The debt service cost, associated with the wastewater treatment
plant, shall be allocated to each outside user in the direct
proportion of the wastewater treatment plant flow capacity
§ 400-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-89
1:387
allocated to the outside user to the total wastewater treatment
plant flow capacity. The flow allocation for each outside user shall
be based on the maximum month flow allocation as stated in the
current agreement between the Village and said outside user. The
total flow capacity of the wastewater treatment plant shall be
based on the maximum month design flow, as approved by the
WDNR, for the most current wastewater treatment plant upgrade
or modification.
(3) In cases where the wastewater flow from an outside user is
conveyed through any part of the Village of East Troy wastewater
collection system in route to the wastewater treatment plant, then
the Village may allocate a portion of the debt service cost,
associated with said portion of the wastewater collection system, to
the outside user. The allocation of said debt service cost to the
outside user shall be in the direct proportion of the outside user's
allocated flow capacity, with a peaking factor applied, to the total
design peak flow capacity of said part of the wastewater collection
system. The design peak flow capacity of said part of the
wastewater collection system shall be as stated in the design basis
as approved by the WDNR; where a documented design basis is not
available, the peak flow design capacity of said section of the
wastewater collection system shall be calculated based on the
Manning Formula method as published in Gravity Sanitary Sewer
Design and Construction (ASCE Manual of Practice No. 60). The
outside user's allocated flow capacity shall be the maximum month
flow capacity, as stated in the current agreement between the
Village and the outside user, with a peaking factor of 4.0 applied.
(4) With regard to the allocation of debt service costs associated with
upgrade or modification of the wastewater treatment plant and/or
the wastewater collection system, outside users shall be required
to contribute to the cost of any such upgrades or modifications as
associated with permit compliance, replacement of aging
structures or equipment, or any other upgrades which the outside
user, directly or indirectly, benefits from. Outside users shall not be
required to contribute to any costs associated with those portions
of wastewater treatment plant or wastewater collection system
upgrades or modifications which are solely associated with
provision of additional treatment capacity for users located in the
Village of East Troy and from which said outside users receive no
direct or indirect benefit.
B. User charge.
(1) All outside users shall be required to pay an equitable portion of
the user charge cost. The user charge for outside users shall be
based on a volume charge rate (RVC) established by the Village and
on the metered volume of wastewater discharged by said user to
the wastewater facilities. The volume of metered wastewater flow
§ 400-89 EAST TROY CODE § 400-89
1:388
for outside users shall be based on readings from Village-approved
flow metering facilities.
(2) The Village shall establish the volume charge rate (RVC), in dollars
per thousand gallons of wastewater, based on the total annual user
charge costs for the wastewater treatment plant divided by total
annual wastewater flow to the wastewater treatment plant in
thousands of gallons.
(3) The volume charge rate (RVC) for outside users is published in the
Schedule of Sewer Service Charge Rates. This schedule is on file,
and available for public viewing, in the Village Clerk-Treasurer's
office. The Village may adjust the volume charge rate, from time to
time, as required to generate sufficient revenue to cover the user
charge costs. Such rate adjustment shall be consistent with the
methodology described herein.
(4) Outside user allocation.
(a) The Village may allocate a portion of the user charge costs for
the Village of East Troy wastewater collection system to
outside users when the wastewater flow from an outside user is
conveyed through any part of the Village of East Troy
wastewater collection system in route to the wastewater
treatment plant. In such cases, the Village may allocate a
portion of the collection system operation and maintenance
cost to the outside user based on the length of the section of
the wastewater collection system through which the outside
user's wastewater flows in route to the wastewater treatment
plant and based on the ratio of the outside user's allocated
flow, with a peaking factor applied, to the total design peak
flow capacity of said section of the wastewater collection
system.
(b) The outside user's allocation of the collection system operation
and maintenance costs shall be in the direct proportion of the
total length-diameter value for the section of the wastewater
collection system through which the outside user's flow is
routed relative to the total length-diameter value for the entire
Village of East Troy wastewater collection system. The lengthdiameter
values shall be calculated as the pipe length, in miles,
times the pipe diameter, in inches. The length-diameter value
for the Village shall be calculated based on sewer mains only;
building sewers shall not be included.
(c) Additionally, the outside user's allocation of the collection
system operation and maintenance costs shall be in the direct
proportion of the ratio of the outside user's total allocated flow
capacity, with a peaking factor applied, to the total peak design
capacity of said part of the wastewater collection system
through which the outside user's wastewater is conveyed. The
§ 400-89 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-89
1:389
§ 400-90. Surcharges for high-strength wastewater.
outside user's allocated flow capacity shall be the maximum
month flow as stated in the current agreement between the
Village and said outside user, with a peaking factor of 4.0
applied. The peak flow design capacity of the section of the
wastewater collection system through which the outside user's
wastewater flows shall be as stated in the design basis as
approved by the WDNR; where a documented design basis
is not available, the design capacity of said section of the
wastewater collection system shall be calculated based on the
Manning Formula method as published in Gravity Sanitary
Sewer Design and Construction (ASCE Manual of Practice No.
60).
A. The sewer service charge for users discharging wastewater with BOD5,
TSS, TKN, or total phosphorus concentrations in excess of the values for
domestic wastewater (high-strength wastewater), as defined in § 400-2
of this chapter, shall include surcharges for BOD5, TSS, total nitrogen,
and/or total phosphorus in addition to the applicable debt service
charges and user charges.
B. Wastewater flows, for the purposes of calculating the wastewater loads
discharged by the user, shall be based on wastewater flow meter
readings if a flow meter is installed on the building sewer or on water
meter readings if a wastewater flow meter is not installed. Wastewater
concentrations, for the purposes of calculating the wastewater loads
discharged by the user, shall be based on routine wastewater sample
analysis as required by the Village in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
C. The Village may apply surcharges to any residential, commercial,
industrial, governmental, institutional, or outside user discharging
high-strength wastewater to the wastewater facilities. The Village may
apply surcharges to any user discharging high-strength wastewater for
one or more days in any month.
D. The sewer service charge (SSC2) for users discharging high-strength
wastewater shall be calculated as follows:
SSC2 = (SUC2) + (SDS2) + (SSR)
SSR
=
[(B - 220) x (VM/1,000) x (8.34) x (SCBOD)]+
[(T - 220) x (VM/1,000) x (8.34) x (SCTSS)]+
[(N - 40) x (VM/1,000) x (8.34) x (SCTN)]+

dollars per pound
(1) The surcharge (SSR) shall be calculated based on concentrations
determined from laboratory analysis of wastewater samples and on
metered water or wastewater volumes. In the case where a single
sample is collected in a given month, the surcharge shall be
calculated based on the metered wastewater volume for that month
and the analytical results of the single sample taken in that month.
In the case where multiple samples are collected and analyzed in a
given month, the concentration used in the surcharge calculation
shall be based on the average value of each two successive samples
and the volume of wastewater metered in the time interval between
the collection of the two samples. The Village may modify the

equipment, accessories, and appurtenances which are anticipated to have a
service life less than the design life of the wastewater facilities.
§ 400-93. Connection fee.
A. Introduction.
(1) It shall be the general policy of the Village of East Troy that new
users connecting to the wastewater collection system reasonably
participate in the cost of the Village's existing wastewater facilities
at the time their properties actually receive sanitary sewer service.
In determining what constitutes reasonable participation toward
such cost, the Village shall be guided by the principle that the area
to be served shall bear its proportionate share of such costs. The
costs of the wastewater facilities in which new users are required
to participate are:
(a) Costs incurred that are reasonable and necessary to construct
the wastewater facilities to serve the new areas; and
(b) Costs of providing excess capacity in the wastewater facilities
until such time as the future users in the new areas connect to
the sanitary sewer system.
(2) Wastewater facilities have a significant physical life. This requires
that they be constructed with sufficient capacity to serve present
users and future users. It is economical to construct wastewater
facilities with excess capacity. Therefore, it is reasonable that
future users, as well as present users, pay the total cost of the
wastewater facilities that serve them. The investment in excess
capacity is made for the future users' benefit and is not available
for other uses by the Village. Because future users make no
payment until they connect to the sanitary sewer, only a part of the
total cost of the wastewater facilities can be collected when said
facilities are first placed in service. Accordingly, the cost incurred
at the time of initial construction of the wastewater facilities,
associated with provision of capacity for future users, should be
recovered from said users through a connection fee.
(3) This connection fee is enacted pursuant to § 66.0821(4) of the
Wisconsin Statutes.
B. Amount of connection fee.
(1) The connection fee is published in the Schedule of Sewer Service
Charge Rates. This schedule is on file, and available for public
viewing, in the Village Clerk-Treasurer's office.
(2) The connection fee shall be calculated on an equivalent meter basis
as follows:
SCC = (Ccc)*(FEM)
§ 400-92 EAST TROY CODE § 400-93
1:394
Where:
SCC = Connection fee, in dollars
CCC = Connection fee per equivalent meter, dollars per
equivalent meter
FEM = Equivalent water meter factor in accordance with
the schedule provided in § 400-88 of this chapter
(3) The equivalent meter factor shall be based on the size of the user's
water meter and shall be determined in accordance with the
equivalent water meter factor schedule provided in § 400-88F of
this chapter. Payment of the connection fee is a condition precedent
to the provision of sanitary sewer service to the property in
question.
C. Annual adjustment to connection fees. Effective as of January 1, 2009,
and each calendar year thereafter, the connection fee shall be increased
by $50. The connection fee shall be in the amount so determined for the
calendar year within which a sewer permit is issued. [Amended
8-20-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-06]
D. Application of connection fee to existing users. The connection fee shall
also be applicable to existing commercial, industrial, governmental, and
institutional users which increase their wastewater discharges to the
wastewater facilities. For said existing users, an additional connection
fee is due when the average daily flow from such user increases by one
residential user flow equivalent or more over an average twenty-fourmonth
period, determined on a January 1 through December 31 period.
At the end of the first twelve-month period, the Village shall reasonably
notify the user in writing that the average daily flow from such existing
user exceeds the foregoing baseline. If the flow is not subsequently
reduced during the remaining 12 months, then the Village shall bill the
user for the connection fee.
E. Special circumstances. The Village Board may but is not required to
adjust any industrial sewer connection fees when special circumstances
allow for fair and reasonable fees suggested by either the Director of
Public Works or the Village Engineer. [Added 12-15-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-15]
F. Payment of connection fee.
(1) The connection fee shall be paid in full before the Village will issue
a building permit for any building or structure. Occupancy of any
building or structure prior to payment of the connection fee shall
be a violation of this chapter.
(2) For existing users who are required to pay a connection fee, or an
additional connection fee, based on increased flows, as described in
Subsection D of this section, the connection fee shall be paid to the
Village within 30 days of notification by the Village that said
§ 400-93 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-93
1:395
connection fee is due. A penalty of 3% per month shall be assessed
on all connection fees not paid within the thirty-day period. If a
connection fee remains delinquent for 90 days, the charges and
penalties shall constitute a lien upon the property and shall be
recorded on the tax roll and collected as other taxes are collected.

A. Sewer service charges shall be billed by the Village to the users on a
quarterly or monthly basis if utility billing determines it is justified.196
B. Where the Village has a service agreement or contract with an outside
user or an industrial user, the charges shall be billed on a quarterly or
monthly basis unless otherwise established in the agreement or
contract.197
C. Charges for hauled wastes disposal shall be billed on a monthly basis.
A. Sewer services charges shall be payable at the Village office, or at any
other officially designated location, within 20 days of the billing date.
B. Property owners shall be held responsible under this chapter for bills
generated by sewer service to properties that they own.
A. Sewer service charges or any other charges due from any user or other
customer of the Village, levied in accordance with this chapter, shall be
a debt due to the Village.
B. If the debt is not paid within 20 days after it is due and payable, it shall
be deemed delinquent. Penalty interest shall be paid on any such
amounts that are delinquent at the rate of 3% per month until paid.
Penalties shall not be compounded. If sewer service charges or any
other charges remain delinquent for 90 days, the charges and penalties
shall constitute a lien upon the property and shall be recorded on the
tax roll and collected as other taxes are collected.
C. The Village shall have the right to remove or close sanitary sewer
connections if the user refuses to pay delinquent charges and to enter
on the user's property for such purpose. The costs for removing or
closing the connection, as well as the costs for restoring the connection,
shall be a debt to the Village. Sanitary sewer connections shall not be
restored until all charges and penalties, including the costs for
removing or closing the connection and the costs for restoring the
connection, have been paid in full.
D. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall
not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties or charges.

The Village shall provide reasonable notification whenever changes occur in
the sewer service charge rates.
E. Reasonable care will be exercised by the Village in the proper delivery
of bills. Failure to receive a bill, however, shall not relieve any person of
the responsibility for payment of sewer service charges within the
prescribed period, nor exempt any person from any penalty imposed for
delinquency in the payment thereof. It is the responsibility of each user
to provide the Village with a current mailing address. If property is sold,
it is the responsibility of the seller to promptly notify the Village of the
change of name and mailing address, for billing purposes, resulting
from such sale.

A. Grade to be established. The grade of all streets, alleys and sidewalks

sidewalks shall be laid to the established grade of the street. All such
grades heretofore established are hereby confirmed. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
B. New sidewalk grade. Whenever a street shall be improved for the first
time, or the grade thereof changed and the street improved so as to
conform to the new grade, the grading of the sidewalk shall be
considered a part of the improvements and shall be let by contract with
the other work of improving such street, and the expense thereof shall
be provided for and borne in all respects like that of improving the
street, but the construction shall be done by the owners of the abutting
lots or parcels of land or at their expense as hereinafter provided.
Before such construction is commenced by the owners of the abutting
lots or parcels of land, the Village Board shall, upon application by the
respective owners for a sidewalk grade, cause such sidewalk grade to
be established.
A. Elevation. The grade or elevation of all underground construction shall

thereafter as is reasonably possible.
H. Restoration of surface. In the event of any such underground
construction, the utility company shall leave the surface of the ground,
or road, in the same condition as before said work was commenced, and
in the event of its failure to do so, the Village may proceed to place the
surface of the ground or street in such condition at the utility company's
expense. Such work shall comply with the provisions of §§ 423-6 and
423-7.
I. Nonrelief from obligation. Compliance with this section does not relieve
the utility company from any responsibility of any kind whatsoever by
reason of the widening of the travel way or any other improvements
which may become necessary, nor does it relieve it from any liability of
any kind or nature whatsoever. Compliance with this section shall not
relieve the utility company from the responsibility or obligation of
removing, relocating or moving any of its mains, pipes or property due
to the opening, widening or improving of streets or due to any other
changes which may occur by reason of which such moving, relocation
or removing may be necessary.

1:419
signal shall be provided so as to safely cycle traffic in each direction
past the work area.
(4) The permittee shall perform the work in such a manner so as not to
disrupt the flow of traffic in the area or endanger the safety of
workmen or passersby. It shall be the responsibility of the
permittee to prevent traffic backup during construction operation.
The permittee shall notify the Director of Public Works 24 hours
prior to commencement of excavation of the location and extent of
the excavation, unless the excavation is an emergency excavation
as identified in Subsection H.
(5) When the operations will result in the loss of any utility service to
private properties, the private properties shall be notified in
writing or by personal contact at least 12 hours prior to the loss of
service, unless the operations are part of an emergency excavation
as defined in Subsection H.
C. Pavement removal.
(1) Removal of existing pavement shall be to neat, straight lines. The

(2) Excavated material to be used for backfilling of the trench must be
so handled and placed as to be of as little inconvenience as
practical to public travel and adjoining tenants.
E. Backfilling.
(1) All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse,
vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks or stones greater than
eight inches in their greatest dimension, frozen lumps or other
material which, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, is
unsuitable.
(2) In refilling the excavation, if there is not sufficient material
excavated suitable for refilling, the deficiency shall be made up
with material, approved prior to use by the Director of Public
Works, hauled in.
(3) Wherever an excavation crosses an existing utility, pipe or other
structure, backfill shall be carefully compacted in stages from the
bottom of the excavation. Any sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water,
telephone, natural gas or other service shall not be interrupted by
the permittee. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to have the
various utilities locate and mark their facilities prior to excavation.
(4) Mechanical compaction shall be used on all materials used for
trench backfill. Each layer (12 inches maximum) shall be uniformly
compacted to a density as determined by the Modified Proctor Test
(ASTM-1557). Compaction or consolidation by flooding shall not be
permitted.

material not achieving the above compaction requirements shall be
removed and recompacted by the permittee. The cost of any
retesting shall be paid by the permittee.
(6) When the sides of the trench will not stand perpendicular,
sheathing and braces shall be used to prevent caving. No timber,
bracing, lagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any
trench. At no time shall any street pavements be permitted to
overhang the excavation.
F. Notice. It shall be the duty of the permittee to notify the Director of
Public Works and all public and private individuals, firms and
corporations affected by the work to be done at least one business day
before such work is to commence. The Director of Public Works shall
§ 423-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 423-7
1:421
also be notified at least four hours prior to backfilling and/or restoring
the surface.
G. Pavement replacement.
(1) Backfill material shall be left below the original surface to allow for
four inches of three-inch crushed stone and four inches of threefourths-
inch crushed stone, plus the thickness of the required
pavement structure. If paving will not occur as part of the initial
street restoration operation, the balance of the opening to the
original surface elevation shall be backfilled with compacted threefourths-
inch crushed stone.
(2) Bituminous pavement shall be placed the full depth of the existing
pavement or three inches, whichever is greater. Bituminous
pavement shall be placed in a maximum of one-and-one-half-inch
base layer and a one-inch top layer, with each layer compacted to
maximum density, and shall consist of Wisconsin Department of
Transportation Gradation No. 1 for the binder course and
Wisconsin Department of Transportation No. 3 for the surface
course. The finished surface shall be smooth and free of surface
irregularities and shall match the existing pavement and any
castings or street appurtenances. Allowable deviations shall be no
more than 1/4 inch as measured with a ten-foot straight edge.
(3) Concrete pavement shall be placed to the full depth of the existing
pavement or seven inches, whichever is greater. Concrete used
shall not contain calcium chloride. The surface shall be given a
light broom finish. The edges shall be tooled to prevent spallation
at the saw cut edge. The surface shall be evenly and completely
sealed with a white pigmented curing compound. The surface shall
be protected from traffic for a minimum of three days. The rebar
shall be installed as directed by Village officials.
(4) In emergency excavations during winter months, when it is not
possible to replace the removed pavement with a like material, the
excavation shall be temporarily resurfaced with a minimum of
three inches of cold mix bituminous material. This temporary
wearing surface shall be compacted and rolled smooth. These
temporary wearing surfaces shall be removed and replaced with
material as specified above by not later than the following June 1,
except as provided above. Permanent pavements shall be replaced
within 60 days of the date of the permit.
H. Emergency excavation. In the event of an emergency, any person, firm
or corporation owning or controlling any sewer, gas main, water main,
conduit or other utility in or under any public street, alley, easement,
way or ground and his/her or its agents and employees take immediate
proper emergency measures to remedy dangerous conditions for the
protection of property, life, health or safety without obtaining an
excavation permit, provided that such person, firm or corporation shall

I. Excavation in new streets limited. Whenever the Village Board
determines to provide for the permanent improvement or repaving of
any street, such determination shall be made not less than 30 days
before the work of improvement or repaving shall begin. Immediately
after such determination by the Village Board, the Director of Public
Works shall notify, in writing, each person, utility or other agency
owning or controlling any sewer, water main, conduit or other utility in
or under said street or any real property abutting said street that all
such excavation work in such street must be completed within 30 days.
After such permanent improvement or repaving, no permit shall be
issued to open or excavate said street for a period of five years after the
date of improvement or repaving unless, in the opinion of the Village
Board or its designee, conditions exist which make it absolutely
essential that the permit be issued. Every effort shall be made to place
gas, electric, telephone and television cable lines in street terraces.209
A. Obstruction and encroachments prohibited. No person shall encroach
upon or in any way obstruct or encumber any street, alley, sidewalk,

1:428
"streets," in the Village. All houses and buildings shall be numbered in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
B. Base lines.
(1) The base line for the north-south streets is derived by assigning the
number 100 to the north line of the township, and the base line of

same as north and south streets if the diagonal runs closer to a
north and south line than to an east and west line and the same as
east and west streets if the diagonal runs closer to an east and west
line than to a north and south line.
C. Procedures.
(1) The numbering for each north and south street shall begin at the
north line of Sections 19 and 20 and run consecutively beginning
with number 1700 on the east side of each street and with number
1701 on the west side of each street and shall run consecutively by

applicable base point shall be assigned the same relative numbers
as if the street had extended through such a line.
(5) Regardless of the width of the building frontage on any street, no
building shall have more than one number on any street, even
though said building has more than one entrance. If a building has
entrances on more than one street, provided the number serves
different occupants, the building shall have one number for each
street. In each case, the lowest assignable number will be the
number of the building.
(6) Where a multiple-unit building has separate outside entrances

alphabetically from "A." In such case, which entrance is designated
by which letter shall be decided by the building owner.

shall be determined by the owners thereof.
D. Placement required. When a house or building has been assigned its
respective number or numbers, the owner or occupant shall place or
cause to be placed in the location required under this section the
number or numbers assigned under the uniform system provided for in
this section.
E. Installation. The cost of the number or numbers shall be paid for by the
property owner and the number or numbers shall be procured from the

cost of such units to the Village. Replacement of uniform numbers shall
be procured, made and paid for by the owner. The numbers used in
replacement shall conform to the uniform numbers. Nothing contained
in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the use of additional
sets of numbers of a different size or style.

of the premises shall cause to be affixed and to be maintained when so
affixed to each principal building controlled by him/her the official
street number assigned to that building, as provided in Subsection A
hereof. The physical numbers provided herein shall not be less than 2 1/
2 inches high on a background of not less than three inches. Each
required number shall be affixed on the particular building in such a
location that it may be easily and readily seen by a person of ordinary
eyesight on the public street or highway upon which the building abuts.
For buildings abutting also on a public alley, the street number shall
also be affixed in such location that it may be seen in like manner from
such alley. Whenever any building is situated more than 50 feet from
the street line, the number of such building shall be conspicuously
displayed at the street line near the walk, driveway or common
entrance to such building and upon the gatepost, fence, tree, post or
other appropriate place so as to be easily discernible from the sidewalk.
Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the
use of additional sets of numbers at other locations on the premises.
K. Noncompliance. If the owner or occupant of any building neglects for
20 days to duly attach and maintain the proper numbers on the
building, the Village shall serve him/her a notice requiring him/her to

collection crews be unable to discharge contents of garbage cans
into collection vehicles using normal handling procedures, the
cans, including contents, will be left at curbside. The owner shall
make provisions to assure that the solid waste therein can be
collected on the next collection day. Collection crews will not empty
garbage cans by means other than dumping.242

§ 483-9 EAST TROY CODE § 483-10
1:548
§ 483-11. Performance standards.
A. Best management practices used to comply with this article shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications based on any of the
following:
(1) Applicable design criteria, standards, and specifications identified
in Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice
Handbook (WDNR Pub. WR-222 November 1993 Revision).
(2) Other design guidance and technical standards identified or
developed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
under Subchapter V of Ch. NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code.
(3) Other technical standards as approved by the Village Engineer.
B. For the purposes of this article, average annual basis is calculated using
the appropriate average annual rainfall or runoff factor, also referred to
as the R factor, or an equivalent design storm using a Type II
distribution, with consideration given to the geographic location of the
site and the period of disturbance.
A. Generally. An erosion and sediment control plan shall be designed to
achieve, to the maximum extent practicable, a reduction of 80% of the
sediment load carried in runoff, on an average annual basis, as
compared with no sediment or erosion controls until the construction
site has undergone final stabilization. (Soil loss prediction tools that
estimate the sediment load leaving the construction site under varying
land and management conditions, or methodology identified in
Subchapter V of Ch. NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code, may be used to calculate
sediment reduction.) No person shall be required to exceed an eightypercent
sediment reduction to meet the requirements of this section.
Erosion and sediment control best management practices may be used
alone or in combination to meet the requirements of this section. Credit
toward meeting the sediment reduction shall be given for limiting the
duration or area, or both, of land disturbing construction activity, or
other appropriate mechanism.
(1) If best management practices cannot be designed and implemented
to reduce the sediment load by 80%, on an average annual basis,
the plan shall include a written and site-specific explanation as to
why the eighty-percent reduction goal is not attainable, and the
sediment load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
(2) Where appropriate, the plan shall include sediment controls to do
all of the following to the maximum extent practicable:
(a) Prevent tracking of sediment from the construction site onto
roads and other paved surfaces.
(b) Prevent the discharge of sediment as part of site dewatering.
§ 483-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-11
1:549
§ 483-12. Administration.
§ 483-13. Application and review procedure.
(c) Protect the separate storm sewer drain inlet structure from
receiving sediment.
(3) The use, storage, and disposal of chemicals, cement, and other
compounds and materials used on the construction site shall be
managed during the construction period to prevent their entrance
into waters of the state. However, projects that require the
placement of these materials in waters of the state, such as
constructing bridge footings or best management practices
installations, are not prohibited by this subsection.
(4) Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations
and along the length of any outfall channel, as necessary, to provide
a nonerosive flow from the structure to a watercourse so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions are
maintained and protected.
B. Location. The best management practices used to comply with this
article shall be located prior to runoff entering waters of the state.
C. Alternate requirements. The Village Engineer may establish
requirements more stringent than those set forth in this article if he or
she determines, on a case-by-case basis, that an added level of
protection is needed to protect sensitive resources.
A. The Village Engineer has the authority to administer and enforce the
provisions of this article and may authorize subordinates to perform the
duties enumerated herein.
B. The Village Engineer is authorized to prepare an application form and
may amend it from time to time.

ARTICLE II
Post-Construction Stormwater Management
§ 483-27. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Post-Construction Stormwater
Management Ordinance" and may be referred to herein as "this article."
§ 483-28. Authority.
§ 483-29. Jurisdiction.
This article applies to all lands located within the municipal boundaries
of the Village of East Troy, the boundaries of which may change through
annexations and/or detachments.
§ 483-30. Legislative findings.
The Village Board finds that uncontrolled post-construction runoff has a
significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general
welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of
natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
A. This article is adopted by the Village Board under the authority granted
by § 61.354, Wis. Stats. This article supersedes all provisions of any
ordinance previously enacted under § 61.35., Wis. Stats., that relate to
stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in
§ 61.354, Wis. Stats., § 61.35, Wis. Stats., applies to this article and to
any amendments to this article.
B. The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful
regulatory powers of the Village of East Troy.
C. The requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent
stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals, including those authorized under §§ 281.16 and
283.33, Wis. Stats., or targeted nonagricultural performance standards
promulgated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under
§ NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
A. Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge,
diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature;
B. Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life,
and recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading
of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria,
pathogens and other urban pollutants;
C. Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads;
§ 483-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-30
1:559
§ 483-31. Purpose and intent.
§ 483-32. Applicability.
D. Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading;
E. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage
facilities;
F. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
increasing major flood peaks and volumes; and
G. Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence
and levels of flooding.
A. Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term
post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic
environment. Specific purposes are to:
(1) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;
(2) Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites,
placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and
scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth; and
(3) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage
facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel
erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of
particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger
downstream property.
B. Intent. It is the intent of the Village of East Troy that this article
regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the
state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Village of
East Troy recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving
the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is
through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive,
systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic
units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such
plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems,
any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site
prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in
conformance with the performance standards developed under
§ 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional stormwater management measures
and have been approved by the Village Board, it is the intent of this
article that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction
management measures acceptable for the community.
§ 483-30 EAST TROY CODE § 483-32
1:560
A. Generally. Where not otherwise limited by law, this article applies after
final stabilization to a site of land disturbing construction activity
meeting any of the criteria in this subsection, unless the site is
otherwise exempt under Subsection B.
(1) A post-construction site that had five or more acres of land
disturbing construction activity.
(2) A post-development construction site that had one or more acres of
land disturbing construction activity after March 10, 2003.
Note to users: The five- and one-acre land disturbance thresholds
are consistent with state and federal laws regarding applicability
of construction site erosion control permits.
B. Exemptions. The following are exempt from the requirements of this
article:
(1) A redevelopment post-construction site with no increase in exposed
parking lots or roads.
(2) A post-construction site with less than 10% connected
imperviousness based on complete development of the postconstruction
site, provided that the cumulative area of all parking
lots and rooftops is less than one acre.
(3) Nonpoint discharges from agricultural facilities and practices.
(4) Nonpoint discharges from silviculture activities.
(5) Routine maintenance for project sites under five acres of land
disturbance if performed to maintain the original line and grade,
hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility.
(6) Underground utility construction such as water, sewer and fiber
optic lines. This exemption does not apply to the construction of
any aboveground structures associated with utility construction.
C. Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in Subsection A, this
article applies to a post-construction site of any size that, in the opinion
of the Village Engineer, is likely to result in runoff that exceeds the safe
capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water,
that causes undue channel erosion, that increases water pollution by
scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers
property or public safety.
D. This article is not applicable to activities conducted by a state agency,
as defined under § 227.01(1), Wis. Stats., but also including the office of
district attorney, which is subject to the state plan promulgated or a
memorandum of understanding entered into under § 281.33(2), Wis.

§ 483-37. Performance standards.
A. Technical standards identified, developed or disseminated by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under Subchapter V of Ch.
NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code.
B. Where technical standards have not been identified or developed by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, other technical standards
may be used, provided that the methods have been approved by the

C. In this article, the following year and location best represent the
average annual rainfall: Milwaukee 1969 (March 28 to December 6).
A. Responsible party. The responsible party shall implement a postconstruction
stormwater management plan that incorporates the
requirements of this section.
B. Plan. A written stormwater management plan in accordance with
§ 483-43 shall be developed and implemented for each postconstruction
site.
C. Requirements. The stormwater management plan shall include the
following:
(1) Total suspended solids. Best management practices shall be
designed, installed and maintained to control total suspended
solids carried in runoff from the post-construction site as follows:
(a) For new development, by design, reduce to the maximum
extent practicable the total suspended solids load by 80%,
based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls. No person shall be required to exceed
an eighty-percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the
requirements of this subsection.
(b) For redevelopment, by design, reduce to the maximum extent
practicable the total suspended solids load by 40%, based on
the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
§ 483-35 EAST TROY CODE § 483-37
1:566
management controls. No person shall be required to exceed
a forty-percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the
requirements of this subsection.
(c) For infill development under five acres that occurs within 10
years after October 1, 2002, by design, reduce to the maximum
extent practicable the total suspended solids load by 40%,
based on an average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls. No person shall be required to exceed a
forty-percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the
requirements of this subsection.
(d) For infill development that occurs 10 or more years after
October 1, 2002, by design, reduce to the maximum extent
practicable the total suspended solids load by 80%, based on
an average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls. No person shall be required to exceed
an eighty-percent total suspended solids reduction to meet the
requirements of this subsection.
(e) Notwithstanding Subsection C(1)(a) to (d), if the design cannot
achieve the applicable total suspended solids reduction as
specified in this subsection, the stormwater management plan
shall include a written and site-specific explanation why that
level of reduction is not attained, and the total suspended
solids load shall be reduced to the maximum extent
practicable.
(f) Pollutant loading models such as SLAMM, P8 or equivalent
methodology may be used to evaluate the efficiency of the
design in reducing total suspended solids.
(2) Peak discharge.
(a) By design, BMPs shall be employed to maintain or reduce the
peak runoff discharge rates, to the maximum extent
practicable, as compared to pre-development, conditionally the
two-, ten-, fifty- and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design
storm applicable to the post-construction site. Predevelopment
conditions shall assume "good hydrologic
conditions" for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55
or an equivalent methodology. The meanings of "hydrologic soil
group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55.
However, when pre-development land cover is cropland, rather
than using TR-55 values for cropland, the runoff curve
numbers in Table 1 shall be used.
§ 483-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-37
1:567
Table 1: Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve
Numbers for Cropland Areas
Hydrologic soil
group A B C D
Runoff curve
number
56 70 79 83
Note: The curve numbers represent mid-range values for soils
under a good hydrologic condition where conservation
practices are used and are selected to be protective of the
resource waters.
(b) This subsection does not apply to any of the following:
[1] A post-construction site where the change in hydrology
due to development does not increase the existing surface
water elevation at any point within the downstream
receiving water by more than 0.01 of a foot for the twoyear,
twenty-four-hour storm event.
Note to users: Hydraulic models such as HEC-RAS or
another methodology may be used to determine the
change in surface water elevations.
[2] A redevelopment post-construction site.
[3] An infill development area less than five acres.
(3) Infiltration. Best management practices shall be designed,
installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff to the maximum extent
practicable in accordance with the following, except as provided in
Subsections C(3)(e) to (h):
(a) For residential developments one of the following shall be met:
[1] Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least 90% of
the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an
average annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 1% of the project site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
[2] Infiltrate 25% of the post-development runoff from the
two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm with a Type II
distribution. Separate curve numbers for pervious and
impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff
volumes and not composite curve numbers as defined in
TR-55. However, when designing appropriate infiltration
systems to meet this requirement, no more than 1% of the
project site is required as an effective infiltration area.
§ 483-37 EAST TROY CODE § 483-37
1:568
(b) For nonresidential development, including commercial,
industrial and institutional development, one of the following
shall be met:
[1] Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least 60% of
the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an
average annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 2% of the project site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
[2] Infiltrate 10% of the runoff from the two-year, twenty-fourhour
design storm with a Type II distribution. Separate
curve numbers for pervious and impervious surfaces shall
be used to calculate runoff volumes and not composite
curve numbers as defined in TR-55. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
requirement, no more than 2% of the project site is
required as an effective infiltration area.
(c) Pre-development condition shall be the same as in Subsection
C(2).
Note to users: A model that calculates runoff volume such as
SLAMM, P8, or an equivalent methodology may be used.
(d) Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for
parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in
commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will enter an
infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to
protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled
maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance
with Subsection C(3)(h). Pretreatment options may include,
but are not limited to, oil/grease separation, sedimentation,
biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips.
Note to users: To achieve the infiltration requirement for the
parking lots or roads, maximum extent practicable should not
be interpreted to require significant topography changes that
create an excessive financial burden. To minimize potential
groundwater impacts, it is desirable to infiltrate the cleanest
runoff. To achieve this, a design may propose greater
infiltration of runoff from low pollutant sources such as roofs
and less from higher pollutant source areas such as parking
lots.
(e) The runoff from the following areas is prohibited from meeting
the requirements of this subsection:
§ 483-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-37
1:569
[1] Areas associated with Tier 1 industrial facilities identified
in § NR 216.21(2)(a), Wis. Adm. Code, including storage,
loading, rooftop and parking.
[2] Storage and loading areas of Tier 2 industrial facilities
identified in § NR 216.21(2)(b), Wis. Adm. Code.
Note to users: Runoff from Tier 2 parking and rooftop
areas may be infiltrated but may require pretreatment.
[3] Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas.
[4] Areas within 1,000 feet upgradient or within 100 feet
downgradient of karst features.
[5] Areas with less than three feet separation distance from
the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of
seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock, except
that this subsection does not prohibit infiltration of roof
runoff.
[6] Areas with runoff from industrial, commercial and
institutional parking lots and roads and residential arterial
roads with less than five feet separation distance from the
bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of
seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock.
[7] Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as
specified in § NR 811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code, or within 100
feet of a private well as specified in § NR 812.08(4), Wis.
Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial,
industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices
for residential development.
[8] Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in § NR
720.03(2), Wis. Adm. Code, are present in the soil through
which infiltration will occur.
[9] Any area where the soil does not exhibit one of the
following soil characteristics between the bottom of the
infiltration system and the seasonal high groundwater and
top of bedrock: at least a three-foot soil layer with 20%
fines or greater or at least a five-foot soil layer with 10%
fines or greater. This does not apply where the soil medium
within the infiltration system provides an equivalent level
of protection. This subsection does not prohibit infiltration
of roof runoff.
Note to users: The areas listed in this subsection are
prohibited from infiltrating runoff due to the potential for
groundwater contamination.

for commercial and industrial development.
[3] Redevelopment post-construction sites.
[4] Infill development areas less than five acres.
[5] Infiltration areas during periods when the soil on the site is
frozen.
[6] Roads in commercial, industrial and institutional land
uses, and arterial residential roads.
(g) Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet
flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be
given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by
this subsection.
(h) Preventive action limit.
[1] Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this
subsection shall, to the extent technically and
economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants
infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance
with the preventive action limit at a point of standards
application in accordance with Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm.
Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that
compliance with a preventive action limit is not
achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or
shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum
extent practicable.
[2] Notwithstanding Subsection C(3)(h)[1], the discharge
from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard
at the point of standards application.
(4) Protective areas.
(a) "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the
top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the
delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the
following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the
channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest
impervious surface. However, in this subsection, "protective
area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream
enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter
the enclosure at this location.
§ 483-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-37
1:571
[1] For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource
waters, and for wetlands in areas of special natural
resource interest as specified in § NR 103.04, Wis. Adm.
Code, 75 feet.
[2] For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a
United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute series
topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever
is more current, 50 feet.
[3] For lakes, 50 feet.
[4] For highly susceptible wetlands, 50 feet. Highly
susceptible wetlands include the following types: fens,
sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, shrub
swamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows,
shallow marshes, deep marshes and seasonally flooded
basins. Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in
accordance with § NR 103.08(1m), Wis. Adm. Code. This
subsection does not apply to wetlands that have been
completely filled in accordance with all applicable state
and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands
that have been partially filled in accordance with all
applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured
from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been
placed.
[5] For less susceptible wetlands, 10% of the average wetland
width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet. Less
susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands
dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass.
[6] In Subsection C(4)(a)[1], [4] and [5], determinations of the
extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be
made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff
susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the
standards and criteria in § NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
[7] For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas
greater than 130 acres, 10 feet.
(b) This subsection applies to post-construction sites located
within a protective area, except those areas exempted
pursuant to Subsection C(4)(d).
(c) The following requirements shall be met:
[1] Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective
area to the maximum extent practicable. The stormwater
management plan shall contain a written site-specific
explanation for any parts of the protective area that are
disturbed during construction.
§ 483-37 EAST TROY CODE § 483-37
1:572
[2] Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within
a protective area, and where no impervious surface is
present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover
of 70% or greater shall be established and maintained. The
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish
habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland
flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative
materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the
bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep
slopes or where high velocity flows occur.
Note to users: It is recommended that seeding of
nonaggressive vegetative cover be used in the protective
areas. Vegetation that is flood and drought tolerant and
can provide long-term bank stability because of an
extensive root system is preferable. Vegetative cover can
be measured using the line transect method described in
the University of Wisconsin Extension publication number
A3533, titled "Estimating Residue Using the Line
Transect Method."
[3] Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or
wet detention basins that are designed to control
pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the
protective area.
Note to users: Other regulations, such as Ch. 30, Wis.
Stats., and Chs. NR 103, 115, 116 and 117, Wis. Adm.
Code, and their associated review and approval process
may apply in the protective area.
(d) This subsection does not apply to:
[1] Redevelopment post-construction sites;
[2] Infill development areas less than five acres;
[3] Structures that cross or access surface waters, such as
boat landings, bridges and culverts;
[4] Structures constructed in accordance with § 59.692(1v),
Wis. Stats.; or
[5] Post-construction sites from which runoff does not enter
the surface water, except to the extent that vegetative
ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
§ 483-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-37
1:573
Note to users: A vegetated protective area to filter runoff
pollutants from post-construction sites described in
Subsection C(4)(d)[5] is not necessary since runoff is not
entering the surface water at that location. Other
practices, necessary to meet the requirements of this
section, such as a swale or basin, will need to be designed
and implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the
runoff enters a surface water of the state.
(5) Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle
maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have
BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum
within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state
contains no visible petroleum sheen.
Note to users: A combination of the following BMPs may be used:
oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup
materials, or any other structural or nonstructural method of
preventing or treating petroleum in runoff.
(6) Swale treatment for transportation facilities.
(a) Applicability. Except as provided in Subsection C(6)(b),
transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance
and pollutant removal meet all of the requirements of this
section, if the swales are designed to the maximum extent
practicable to do all of the following:
[1] Be vegetated. However, where appropriate, nonvegetative
measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide
for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization or
check dams.
Note to users: It is preferred that tall and dense
vegetation be maintained within the swale due to its
greater effectiveness at enhancing runoff pollutant
removal.
[2] Carry runoff through a swale for 200 feet or more in length
that is designed with a flow velocity no greater than 1.5
feet per second for the peak flow generated using either a
two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm or a two-year
storm with a duration equal to the time of concentration as
appropriate. If a swale of 200 feet in length cannot be
designed with a flow velocity of 1.5 feet per second or less,
then the flow velocity shall be reduced to the maximum
extent practicable.
§ 483-37 EAST TROY CODE § 483-37
1:574
Note to users: Check dams may be included in the swale
design to slow runoff flows and improve pollutant
removal. Transportation facilities with continuous
features such as curb and gutter, sidewalks or parking
lanes do not comply with the design requirements of this
subsection. However, a limited amount of structural
measures such as curb and gutter may be allowed as
necessary to account for other concerns such as human
safety or resource protection.
Note to users: The Department of Natural Resource's
regional stormwater staff can determine if additional
BMPs, beyond a water quality swale, are needed under
this paragraph.
(b) Exemptions. The Village Engineer may, consistent with water
quality standards, require that other provisions of this section
be met on a transportation facility with an average daily travel
of vehicles greater than 2,500 and where the initial surface
water of the state that the runoff directly enters is any of the
following:
[1] An outstanding resource water;
[2] An exceptional resource water;
[3] Waters listed in Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water
Act that are identified as impaired, in whole or in part, due
to nonpoint source impacts; or
[4] Waters where targeted performance standards are
developed under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code, to meet
water quality standards.
D. General considerations for on-site and off-site stormwater management
measures. The following considerations shall be observed in managing
runoff:
(1) Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales,
natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural
groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the
extent possible, to meet the requirements of this section.
(2) Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be
provided to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream
drainage facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream
property or public safety.
E. Location and regional treatment option.
(1) The BMPs may be located on site or off site as part of a regional
stormwater device, practice or system.
§ 483-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 483-37
1:575
(2) Post-construction runoff within a nonnavigable surface water that
flows into a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not required to
meet the performance standards of this article. Post-construction
BMPs may be located in nonnavigable surface waters.
(3) Except as allowed under Subsection E(4), post-construction runoff
from new development shall meet the post-construction
performance standards prior to entering a navigable surface water.
(4) Post-construction runoff from any development within a navigable
surface water that flows into a BMP is not required to meet the
performance standards of this article if the BMP was constructed
prior to the effective date of this article and the BMP either
received a permit issued under Ch. 30, Wis. Stats., or the BMP did
not require a Ch. 30, Wis. Stats., permit and the BMP is designed to
provide runoff treatment from future upland development.
(5) Runoff from existing development, redevelopment and infill areas
shall meet the post-construction performance standards in
accordance with this subsection.
(a) To the maximum extent practicable, BMPs shall be located to
treat runoff prior to discharge to navigable surface waters.
(b) Post-construction BMPs for such runoff may be located in a
navigable surface water if allowable under all other applicable
federal, state and local regulations, such as Ch. NR 103, Wis.
Adm. Code, and Ch. 30, Wis. Stats.
Note to users: This allows the location of BMPs in navigable
surface waters where necessary to augment management
practices upstream of the navigable surface water to meet the
performance standards.
(6) The discharge of runoff from a BMP, such as a wet detention pond,
or after a series of such BMPs is subject to this article.
Note to users: This section does not supersede any other
applicable federal, state or local regulation, such as Ch. NR 103,
Wis. Adm. Code, and Ch. 30, Wis. Stats.
(7) The Village Engineer may approve off-site management measures,
provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(a) The Village Engineer determines that the post-construction
runoff is covered by a stormwater management system plan
that is approved by the Village of East Troy and that contains
management requirements consistent with the purpose and
intent of this article.
(b) The off-site facility:
[1] Is in place;
§ 483-37 EAST TROY CODE § 483-37
1:576
§ 483-38. Administration.
§ 483-39. Application and review procedure.
[2] Is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of
stormwater control equal to or greater than that which
would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the
performance standards of this article; and
[3] Has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term
operation and maintenance.
(8) Where a regional treatment option exists such that the Village
Engineer exempts the applicant from all or part of the minimum onsite
stormwater management requirements, the applicant shall be
required to pay a fee in an amount determined in negotiation with
the Village Board. In determining the fee for post-construction
runoff, the Village Engineer shall consider an equitable distribution
of the cost for land, engineering design, construction, and
maintenance of the regional treatment option.
F. Alternate requirements. The Village Engineer may establish
stormwater management requirements more stringent than those set
forth in this section if he or she determines that an added level of
protection is needed to protect sensitive resources.
A. The Village Engineer has the authority to administer and enforce the
provisions of this article and may authorize subordinates to perform the
duties enumerated herein.
B. The Village Engineer is authorized to prepare an application form and

conditions, and holders of permits issued under this article shall be
deemed to have accepted these conditions. The Village Engineer may
suspend or revoke a permit for violation of a permit condition, following
written notification of the responsible party. An action by the Village
Engineer to suspend or revoke an approved permit may be appealed in
accordance with § 483-47.
(1) Compliance with this permit does not relieve the responsible party
of the responsibility to comply with other applicable federal, state,

perform any work or operations necessary to bring stormwater
management measures into conformance with the approved
stormwater management plan and consents to a special
assessment or charge against the property as authorized under
Subchapter VII of Ch. 66, Wis. Stats., or to charging such costs
against the financial guarantee posted under § 483-41.
(8) If so directed by the Village Engineer, the responsible party shall
repair at the responsible party's own expense all damage to
adjoining municipal facilities and drainageways caused by runoff,
where such damage is caused by activities that are not in
compliance with the approved stormwater management plan.
(9) The responsible party shall permit property access to the Village
Engineer or designee for the purpose of inspecting the property for
compliance with the approved stormwater management plan and
the permit.
(10) Where site development or redevelopment involves changes in
direction, increases in peak rate and/or total volume of runoff from
a site, the Village Engineer may require the responsible party to
make appropriate legal arrangements with affected property
owners concerning the prevention of endangerment to property or
public safety.
(11) The responsible party is subject to the enforcement actions and
penalties described in this article if the responsible party fails to
comply with the terms of an approved permit.
B. In addition to the requirements set forth in this article, the Village
Engineer may impose one or more conditions of approval needed to
meet the performance standards in § 483-37 or a financial guarantee as
provided for in § 483-41.

flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation,
unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the
health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the proposed
subdivision or of the community. The Village Board, in applying the
provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the particular facts
upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for
residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present
evidence regarding such unsuitability. Thereafter, the Village Board,

II).
§ 495-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-7
1:607
§ 495-8. Condominium developments.
upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, may affirm, modify,
or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
B. Existing flora. The subdivider shall make every effort to protect and
retain all existing trees, shrubbery, vines and grasses not actually lying
in public roadways, drainageways, building foundation sites, private
driveways, soil absorption waste disposal areas, paths, and trails. Such
trees are to be protected and preserved during construction, in
accordance with sound conservation practices, possibly including the
preservation of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever
abutting grades are altered, pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by the
subdivider.
A. Purpose.
(1) The Village Board hereby finds that certain issues arise in
condominium developments that require limited applicability of
this chapter to condominium developments. The State Legislature
has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to
condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose
burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed
on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration
of condominium.
(2) The factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium
development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at
or near the ground surface, subject to property taxation as
separate parcels, with each property entity having different
ownership and management. The Village of East Troy determines
that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, both
physically and in ownership, from developments in which the land
and improvements are under unitary ownership, management, and
control.
(3) Thus, the Village Board hereby finds that new condominium
developments can place impacts on community resources in the
same manner as other new developments which are characterized
by division of land into lots. These impacts include:
(a) Additional population density.
(b) Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to
the land's characteristics.
(c) Additional demands upon Village area parks, recreation areas,
utility facilities, and schools.
(d) Additional traffic and street use.
§ 495-7 EAST TROY CODE § 495-8
1:608
B. Portions of chapter applicable to condominium developments. The
following sections of this chapter shall apply to condominium
developments:
(1) Section 495-7 relating to land suitability and construction
practices.
(2) Sections 495-9 through 495-11 relating to preliminary plat
approval. A condominium plat prepared pursuant to § 703.11, Wis.
Stats., shall be reviewed in the same manner as a preliminary
subdivision plat as set forth in this chapter. This stage of approval
shall be the only approval required for a condominium
development. The technical requirements for preliminary plats set
forth in § 495-20 shall not apply, since condominiums have separate
technical standards set forth in § 703.11, Wis. Stats.
(3) Article VI relating to required improvements.
(4) Article VII relating to design standards for improvements.
(5) Article VIII relating to park and public land dedication
requirements.
(6) Article IX relating to fees for review.
C. Additional information. The plat shall show correctly on its face, in
addition to the information required by § 703.11, Wis. Stats., and
Article IV of this chapter:
(1) The exact location of any building on the property and common
element locations.
(2) Floor plans of all unique units which also show any limited common
elements that go with the units.
(3) Any other information that the Village requires to complete the
review of the condominium plat.
D. Condominium plat review fee.259
(1) The developer shall pay a fee set by the Village Board to the Village
Clerk-Treasurer at the time of first application for approval of any
condominium plats to assist in defraying the cost of review.
(2) A reapplication fee set by the Village Board shall be paid to the
Village Clerk-Treasurer at the time of reapplication for approval of
any condominium plat which has previously been reviewed.
E. Exceptions. This section shall not apply to the following condominiums:
259. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 495-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-8
1:609
(1) Any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of this
chapter.
(2) Any conversion of a structure or structures in existence on the
effective date of this chapter to a condominium after the effective
date of this chapter.

Land Division Review and Approval
§ 495-9. Preliminary consultation. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord.
No. 2019-18]
Before filing a preliminary plat or certified survey map (minor land division),
the subdivider is encouraged to consult with the Plan Commission for
advice regarding general subdivision requirements. Information on meeting
dates, agenda deadlines, and filing requirements may be obtained from
the Village Clerk. The subdivider shall also submit a location map showing
the relationship of the proposed subdivision to traffic arteries and existing
community facilities. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory but
is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these
regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, and duly adopted Comprehensive
Plan implementation devices of the Village and to otherwise assist the
subdivider in planning the development. In so doing, both the subdivider
and planning agency may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general
program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible
effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider will gain a
better understanding of the subsequent required procedures.
§ 495-10. Submission of preliminary plat.
A. Submission. Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider
shall prepare a preliminary plat and a letter of application. The
preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter. The
subdivider shall file five copies of the preliminary plat and the
application with the Village Clerk at least 25 days prior to the meeting
of the Plan Commission at which action is desired. The
Village Clerk shall submit a copy of the preliminary plat to the Plan
Commission and to the Village Engineer and Village Attorney for review
and written report of their recommendations and reactions to the
proposed plat. An abstract of title or registered property report shall be
referred to the Village Attorney at this time for examination and report.
[Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
B. Public improvements. Simultaneously with the filing of the preliminary
plat, the subdivider shall file with the Village Clerk a report addressing
sewer and water service feasibility, drainage facilities, and centerline
profiles showing proposed streets in the subdivision. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
C. Restrictive covenants. A draft of the legal instruments and rules for
proposed property owners' associations, when the subdivider proposes
that common property within a subdivision would be either owned or
maintained by such an organization of property owners or a subunit of
the Village pursuant to § 236.293, Wis. Stats., and proposed deed
restrictions or restrictive covenants, shall be submitted at the time of
§ 495-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-10
1:611
filing the preliminary plat with the Village Clerk. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
D. Environmental assessment.
(1) An environmental assessment checklist (see § 495-17) shall be
completed by the subdivider for review by the Plan Commission
with the preliminary plat, or preferably as part of the preliminary
consultation, for any subdivision or minor land division which the
Village has authority to approve.
(2) The purpose of this environmental assessment checklist is to
provide the basis for an orderly, systematic review of the effects of
all new subdivisions upon the community environment in
accordance with the principles and procedures of Wisconsin
Statutes set for local subdivision regulation. The Plan Commission
will use these procedures in determining land suitability. The goals
of the community in requiring this checklist are to eliminate or
reduce pollution and siltation to an acceptable standard, assure
ample living space per capita, preserve open space and parks for
recreation, provide adequately for stormwater control, maintain
scenic beauty and aesthetic surroundings, administer to the
economic and cultural needs of the citizens, and provide for the
effective and efficient flow of goods and services.
(3) The environmental assessment checklist shall apply to all
reviewable subdivisions and land divisions by certified survey. The
Plan Commission may waive the requirement for the filing of an
environmental assessment checklist for land division by certified
survey of less than five acres total area.
E. Certification. The surveyor preparing the preliminary plat shall certify
on the face of the plat that it is a correct representation of all existing
land divisions and features and that it is in full compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
F. Filing requirements. The following shall also be filed with the
preliminary plat:
(1) A statement of the proposed use of lots, including type of
residential buildings with number of proposed dwelling units and
types of business or industry, as to reveal the effect of the
development on traffic, fire hazards, environmental impact, and
congestion of population.
(2) If any zoning changes are contemplated, the proposed zoning plan
for the areas, including dimensions.
(3) Where the subdivider owns property adjacent to the proposed
subdivision, the Plan Commission and/or Village Board may require
that the subdivider submit a preliminary plat of the remainder of
the property so as to show the possible relationships between the
§ 495-10 EAST TROY CODE § 495-10
1:612

proposed subdivision and future subdivisions. In any event, all
subdivisions must be shown to relate well with existing or potential
adjacent subdivisions.
G. Street plans and profiles. The subdivider shall provide street plans and
profiles showing existing ground surface and proposed and established
street grades, including extensions for a reasonable distance beyond
the limits of the proposed subdivision when required.
H. Soil testing. The subdivider may be required to provide a preliminary
soils report, listing the types of soil in the proposed subdivision, their
effect on the subdivision and a proposed soil testing and investigation
program. Pursuant to the public policy concerns prescribed in § 495-7,
the Village Board may require that borings and soundings be made in
specified areas to ascertain subsurface soil, rock, and water conditions,
including depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater table.
I. Drafting standards. The subdivider shall submit to the Village Clerk,
and to those agencies having the authority to object to plats under
provisions in Chapter 236 of the Wisconsin Statutes, copies of a
preliminary plat (or certified survey map) based upon an accurate
exterior boundary survey by a professional land surveyor. The plat shall
clearly depict the proposed subdivision at a scale of not more than one
inch per 100 feet; two-foot contour intervals; grading, tree planting,
paving, installation of facilities and dedications of land; and easements.
The subdivider shall also indicate when improvements will be provided.

authorities of any objection based upon failure of the plat to comply
with the statutes or rules which its examination is authorized to
cover or, if all objections have been satisfied, it shall so certify
on the face of a copy of the plat and return that copy to the
approving authority from which it was received. The plat shall not
be approved or deemed approved until all objections have been
satisfied. If the objecting agency fails to act within the twenty-day
limit, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat.
(3) In lieu of the procedure under Subsection A(1) above, the
subdivider may submit the original plat to WisDOA, which shall
forward two copies to each of the agencies authorized to object.

receipt of the original plat, it shall be deemed that there are no
objections to the plat and, upon demand, it shall be so certified on
the face of the plat by WisDOA.
B. Review by other Village agencies. The Village Clerk shall transmit a
copy of the preliminary plat to the Village Engineer, Village Attorney,
Village Zoning Administrator and to all affected Village boards,
commissions, or departments, and all affected local utility companies,
for their review and recommendations concerning matters within their
jurisdiction. Their recommendations, if any, shall be transmitted to the
Plan Commission within 15 days from the date the plat is filed. The
preliminary plat shall then be reviewed by the Plan Commission for
conformance with this chapter and all ordinances, rules and regulations
and the Comprehensive Plan. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-18]
C. Plan Commission review. After review of the preliminary plat and
negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the
kind and extent of public improvements which will be required, the Plan
Commission shall, within 60 days of filing, or within such time as
extended by agreement with the subdivider of its submission, approve,
approve conditionally, or reject the plat. The subdivider shall be notified
in writing of any conditions for approval or the reasons for rejection.
Such action of the Plan Commission shall be submitted to the Village
Board for approval, and the subdivider shall be notified in writing of any
§ 495-11 EAST TROY CODE § 495-11
1:614
§ 495-12. Final plat review and approval. [Amended 12-15-2014 by
Ord. No. 2014-13]
changes or modifications in the action of the Plan Commission and the
reasons therefor.
D. Board action. After receipt of the Plan Commission's recommendation,
the Village Board shall, within 90 days of the date the plat was filed with
the Village Clerk, approve, approve conditionally, or reject such plat
and shall state, in writing, any conditions of approval or reasons for
rejection, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider.
Failure of the Village Board to act within 90 days of filling of the plat or
extension thereof shall constitute an approval of the preliminary plat,
unless other authorized agencies object to the plat. The
Village Clerk shall communicate to the subdivider the action of the
Village Board. If the preliminary plat is approved, the
Village Clerk shall endorse it for the Village Board. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
E. Effect of preliminary plat approval. Approval or conditional approval of
a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the final
plat, except that if the final plat is submitted within 36 months of a
preliminary plat approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary
plat layout, the final plat shall be entitled to approval. Conditional
approval may be granted subject to satisfactory compliance with
pertinent provisions of this chapter and Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. The
preliminary plat shall be deemed an expression of approval or
conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the
preparation of the final plat, which will be subject to further
consideration by the Plan Commission and Village Board at the time of
its submission.
F. Preliminary plat amendment. Should the subdivider desire to amend
the preliminary plat as approved, he/she may resubmit the amended
plat which shall follow the same procedure, except for the fee, unless
the amendment is, in the opinion of the Village Board, of such scope as
to constitute a new plat, in which such case it shall be refiled.
A. Filing requirements.
(1) The subdivider shall prepare a final plat and a letter of application
in accordance with this chapter and shall file one paper and one
electronic copy of the plat and the application with the

shall file one paper and one electronic copy of the final plat not
later than 36 months after the date of approval of the preliminary
plat; otherwise, the preliminary plat and final plat will be
considered void unless an extension is requested in writing by the
subdivider and for good cause granted by the Village. The owner or
subdivider shall also submit at this time a current certified abstract
§ 495-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-12
1:615

public sewer and a provision for that service has not been made.
The subdivider shall file with the Village Clerk an affidavit
indicating that the plat fully complies with the requirement of filing
with WisDOA, WisDOT and WisDSPS, which are considered to be
objecting agencies. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02;
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(3) The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved and

required by this chapter. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-18]
(5) The Village Clerk shall refer two copies of the final plat to the Plan
Commission, one copy to the Village Engineer, one copy to the
Village Attorney, and a copy each to the telephone and power and
other utility companies. The abstract of title or registered property
report and final plat shall be referred to the Village Attorney for his/
her examination and report. The Village Clerk shall also refer final
plans and specifications for public improvements required by this
chapter to the Village Engineer for review. [Amended 12-16-2019

the responsibility to review plats shall provide the Plan Commission
and Village Board with his or her conclusions as to whether the
final plat conforms substantially to the preliminary plat and with
his or her recommendation on approval of the final plat.
§ 495-12 EAST TROY CODE § 495-12
1:616
(2) Village staff may only recommend approval of the final plat upon a
determination that all required public and private improvements
have been provided as set forth in § 495-23.
(3) The recommendations of the Village Attorney and Village Engineer
shall be made within 30 days of the filing of the final plat. The
Village Engineer shall examine the plat or map and the final plans
and specifications of public improvements for technical details and,
if he/she finds them satisfactory, shall so certify in writing to the
Plan Commission. If the plat, map, or the plans and specifications
are not satisfactory, the Village Engineer shall return them to the
owner and so advise the Plan Commission.
C. Plan Commission review.
(1) The Plan Commission shall examine the final plat as to its
conformance with the approved preliminary plat, any conditions of
approval of the preliminary plat, this chapter, and all applicable
ordinances, rules, regulations, comprehensive plans which may
affect it and shall recommend approval, conditional approval, or
rejection of the plat to the Village Board. The recommendations of
the Plan Commission shall be made within 30 days of the filing of
the final plat.
(2) The Plan Commission may only recommend approval of the final
plat upon a determination that all required public and private
improvements have been provided as set forth in § 495-23.
(3) The objecting agencies shall, within 20 days of the date of receiving
their copies of the final plat, notify the subdivider and all other
approving and objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no
objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy of the plat
and shall return that copy to the Village. If an objecting agency fails
to act within 20 days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the
plat.
(4) If the final plat is not submitted within 36 months of the last
required approval of the preliminary plat, the Village Board may
refuse to approve the final plat or may extend the time for
submission of the final plat.
(5) The Plan Commission shall, within 30 days of the date of filing of
the final plat with the Village Clerk, recommend approval,
conditional approval, or rejection of the plat and shall transmit the

Village Board. The Plan Commission may hold the matter in
abeyance if there is incomplete or inadequate information.
[Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
D. Board review and approval.

12-15-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-13]
(1) The Village Board shall, within 60 days of the date of filing the
original final plat with the Village Clerk, approve or reject such
plat, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider.
If the plat is rejected, the reasons shall be stated in the minutes of
the meeting and a written statement of the reasons forwarded to
the subdivider. The Village Board may not inscribe its approval on
the final plat unless the Village Clerk certifies on the face of the
plat that the copies were forwarded to objecting agencies as
required herein, the date thereof and that no objections have been
filed within 20 days or, if filed, have been met. [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(2) The Village Board may only approve the final plat upon a
determination that all required public and private improvements
have been provided as set forth in § 495-23.
(3) The Village Board shall, when it determines to approve a final plat,

(4) Failure of the Village Board to act within 60 days, the time having
not been extended and no unsatisfied objections having been filed,
the plat shall be deemed approved.
E. Recording. After the final plat has been approved by the Village Board,
the Village Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat
attesting to such approval to be duly executed and the plat returned to
the subdivider for recording with the Register of Deeds. The Register of
Deeds cannot record the plat unless it is offered within 12 months after
the date of the last approval of the plat and within 36 months after the
first approval. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
F. Copies. The subdivider shall file one paper and one electronic copy of
the final plat with the Village Clerk for distribution to the approving
agencies, affected sanitary districts, and other affected agencies for

G. Partial platting. The final plat may, if permitted by the Village Board,
constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the
subdivider proposes to record at the time.
A. Generally. When it is proposed to divide land into not more than four
parcels or sites, or when it is proposed to divide a block, lot, or outlot
into not more than four parcels or sites within a recorded subdivision
plat without changing the boundaries of said block, lot, or outlot, the
subdivider shall subdivide by use of a certified survey map. In the event
a proposed land division does not meet the above requirements, the
§ 495-12 EAST TROY CODE § 495-13
1:618
proposed land division must be pursued as a subdivision plat. A
certified survey map, prepared by a professional land surveyor, shall
comply with the requirements of § 236.34, Wis. Stats., as well as all
requirements set forth in this chapter. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord.
No. 2015-02]
B. Land to be included in survey. The certified survey map shall include the
entire lot, parcel, or tract of land being divided, except that the Village

unpaid special assessments or taxes on the lands shall be included on
the certified survey map. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-18]
D. Conceptual review procedure. The following steps shall be used in the
review of a conceptual certified survey map:
(1) Presubmittal meeting. Before submitting an application, the
subdivider is encouraged to meet with the Zoning Administrator
and other Village officials to review applicable zoning and land
division requirements. This consultation is neither formal nor
mandatory but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose
and objectives of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, and
duly adopted Comprehensive Plan implementation devices of the
Village and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning the
development.
(2) Submittal. The subdivider shall submit a completed application and
the conceptual certified survey map in the number requested by
the Village Clerk along with the application fee as may be set by
the Village Board. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(3) Review by other Village agencies. The Village Clerk shall transmit a
copy of the map to the Village Engineer, Village Attorney, Village
Zoning Administrator and to all affected Village boards,
commissions or departments for their review and

granted by the Plan Commission, the subdivider shall prepare a final
certified survey map consistent with § 236.34, Wis. Stats., and this
chapter and submit it for review at least 25 days prior to the meeting at
which time certified survey map approval is requested. The following
steps shall be used in the review of a final certified survey map:
(1) Submittal. The subdivider shall submit a completed application and
the final certified survey map in the number requested by the
Village Clerk along with the application fee as may be set by the
Village Board. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(2) Referral to Plan Commission. The Village Clerk shall, within two
normal workdays after filing, transmit the copies of the application

from the date of filing of the map, unless the time is extended by
agreement with the applicant. If the map is rejected, the reason
shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting and a written
statement forwarded to the applicant. If the map is approved, the
Village Board shall cause the Village Clerk to so certify on the face
of the original map and return the map to the applicant. The Village
Board may only approve the certified survey map upon a
determination that all required public and private improvements
have been provided as set forth in § 495-23. [Amended

G. Building permits. No building permits shall be issued until the certified
survey is recorded and a document recording number is filed with the
Village Building Inspector.
H. Reapprovals. Submittals of previously approved certified survey maps
for replatting or reapproval by the Village Board shall be in accordance
with § 495-14.
A. Except as provided in § 70.27(1), Wis. Stats., when it is proposed to
replat a recorded subdivision or part thereof, so as to change the
exterior boundaries of a recorded subdivision or part thereof, the
subdivider or person wishing to replat shall vacate or alter the recorded
plat as provided in §§ 236.40 through 236.44, Wis. Stats. The subdivider
or person wishing to replat shall then proceed using the approval
procedures for preliminary and final plats prescribed in this article.
B. Whenever an approved final plat is submitted for reapproval within six
months of the initial resolution approving the plat, and which is
substantially in conformance with the approved plat, and which has not
been recorded with the Register of Deeds, said plat shall be reapproved
by the Village Board. No final plats shall be reapproved by the Village
Board following the expiration of the six-month period. Such plats shall
be submitted as a new plat. All previous approvals shall be null and void
and shall have no further bearing on the subsequent review and
approval of the plat by the Village.
A. A preliminary plat, final plat, or certified survey shall not be approved
unless the Plan Commission and the Village Board determine that
adequate public facilities and public services will be available to meet
the needs of the proposed land division and that no public funds other
than those already provided in an adopted capital or operating budget
are required. The Village Board, at its discretion, may waive this
provision if the Board agrees to use bonding/borrowing for the project.
B. The applicant shall furnish any data requested by the Village Clerk, who
shall transmit this information to the appropriate Village commissions,
committees, and staff for review. The Village Clerk shall act as
coordinator of the reports from staff to the Plan Commission and Village

transportation facilities, and schools. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord.
No. 2019-18]
C. Public facilities and public services for a proposed land division may be
found to be adequate when the following conditions exist:
(1) The proposed land division is located in an urban service area
where adequate sewer service is presently available for extension,
under construction, or designated by the Village Board for
extension of sewer service within the current capital budget year
and funds are specifically provided for such extension either from
public or private financing. The Plan Commission and the Village
Board shall consider the recommendations of the Village Engineer
and the appropriate committee(s) on the capacity of trunk lines and
of sewage treatment facilities and any other information presented.
(2) The proposed land division is located within an urban service area
contiguous to an arterial transmission water main of adequate
capacity for the proposed development or if the water distribution
system that is needed is under construction or scheduled for
construction within the current budget year and funds, either
public or private, are available for the program. The Plan
Commission and the Village Board shall consider the
recommendation from the Village utility providers and the Village
Engineer and the appropriate committee(s) on line capacities,
water sources and storage facilities, as well as any other
information presented.
(3) The Village Treasurer verifies to the Plan Commission and the
Village Board that adequate funds, either public or private, are
available to ensure the installation of all necessary stormwater
management facilities. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.

(4) The Director of Public Works can demonstrate to the Plan
Commission and the Village Board that street maintenance and
refuse collection services, either public or private, are so situated
that adequate and timely service can be provided so as not to
involve danger or injury to the health, safety, or general welfare of
the future residents of the proposed land division or existing
Village residents.
(5) The Plan Commission verifies that the future residents of the
proposed land division can be assured park, recreation, and open
space facilities and services which meet the standards of the
Village's Comprehensive Plan.
(6) The Police Department, Emergency Services, and Fire Department
verify that timely and adequate service can be provided to the
residents. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02]

§ 495-16. Land divisions in extraterritorial jurisdiction.
(7) The proposed land division is accessible by an existing or officially
mapped, publicly maintained, all-weather roadway system
adequate to accommodate both existing traffic and that traffic to be
generated by the proposed land division in accordance with the
Official Map and Village standards.
D. Where the Plan Commission and the Village Board determine that one
or more public facilities or services are not adequate for the proposed
development but that a portion of the area could be served adequately,
or that careful phasing of the development could result in all public
facilities and public services being adequate, conditional approval may
include only such portions or may specify phasing of the development.
E. Areas within the Village capable of being served by public sewer and
water shall be required to connect to the Village of East Troy public
water distribution and/or public sewerage system if determined by the
Village Engineer to be feasible. If such connections are not determined
feasible, the proposed land division shall provide for adequate on-site
systems and such special piping provisions as may be necessary to
serve the anticipated development during the interim period until such
Village public water and/or sewerage systems are determined by the
Village Engineer to be feasibly available for connection. The subdivider
and his/her heirs and assigns shall, by written plat restriction, agree to
abandon the interim water and sewerage facilities and connect to the
Village public water and sewerage facilities upon a determination by
the Village Engineer that such facilities are available for feasible
connection.
F. The above requirements of this section shall not apply to those areas
outside the corporate limits of the Village of East Troy and within the
Village's extraterritorial limits.
A. Application required. No person, firm, or corporation shall divide any
land located within the one-and-one-half-mile extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village of East Troy without first filing an application
with the Village for, and receiving Village approval of, a certified survey
map and/or preliminary and final plat.
B. Preapplication procedure. Before filing an application for approval of a
certified survey, the subdivider shall consult with the Plan Commission
and shall prepare a preliminary sketch for review and approval and
complete an environmental assessment checklist (see § 495-17). This
procedure will assist the applicant in appraising the objectives of these
regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map and other pertinent
Village ordinances. The preapplication information shall be submitted
to the Plan Commission for review and approval 15 days prior to the
meeting at which the application will be considered.

§ 495-18. Prior review of sales or exchanges of land between
adjoining landowners. [Added 11-3-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-11]
A. Generally. In every situation, regardless of circumstances, that a
property owner seeks to convey land in a manner that would adjust a lot
line or create or eliminate a lot line, and that conveyance does not
require a certified survey map or subdivision plat pursuant to this
chapter, and where an adjacent property owner intends to acquire such
interest in land, the proposed conveyance shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for review before the conveyance documents are
signed and before the conveyance is recorded in the office of the
Walworth County Register of Deeds.
B. Review procedure. The general steps outlined below shall be used to
review an application for a sale or exchange between adjoining
landowners:
(1) Presubmittal meeting. Before submitting an application, the
applicant or the applicant's agent may meet with the Zoning
Administrator to review applicable regulations and procedures and
the proposed transfer.
§ 495-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-18
1:627
(2) Submittal of application materials. The applicant shall submit a
completed application and other required materials to the Zoning
Administrator along with the application fee set forth in the fee
schedule adopted from time to time by the Village Board.
(3) Staff review. Within 10 days of submittal, the Zoning Administrator
shall either determine that the application is incomplete and notify
the applicant, in writing, of any deficiencies or make a decision
based on the decision criteria contained in this section to approve
the application, approve the application with conditions, or deny
the application. The Zoning Administrator shall take no further
steps to process the application until the deficiencies are remedied.
The incomplete application shall be retained as a public record.
(4) Applicant notification. Within 15 days following his or her decision
to approve or deny the application, the Zoning Administrator shall
mail the decision notice to the applicant by regular mail.
(5) Public record copy. A duplicate copy of the decision notice shall be
retained as a public record.
C. Review criteria. The review by the Zoning Administrator, and by the
Plan Commission on appeal, shall be limited to considering whether the
conveyance is in compliance with § 236.45(2)(am)3, Wis. Stats., and the
applicable laws cited therein, including these regulations, the Village's
zoning regulations, and other applicable laws and ordinances. Such
conveyance can only be approved if the same number of lots exist prior
to the conveyance as would exist after the conveyance. Such
conveyance can only be approved if the resulting lots would all be both
legal and conforming, even if any such lots are legal nonconforming
prior to the conveyance, because the conveyance creates new lots
which do not predate the ordinance and therefore have no legal
nonconforming rights. Such conveyance must not be approved if the
conveyance includes land that has a legal nonconforming use, because
the legal nonconforming rights are limited to use of the preexisting lot.
Such conveyance shall not be approved if any of the resulting lots and
the existing improvements on the lots would be in violation of
applicable open space requirements. Such conveyance shall not be
approved if the conveyance would make an existing conforming
structure illegal or nonconforming or would increase the extent of any
preexisting legal nonconformity of an existing structure.
D. Expiration of approval. An approval granted under this section shall
automatically expire 12 months after the date of issuance if the
transaction has not been recorded in the Walworth County Register of
Deeds office.
E. Appeal. An aggrieved person may appeal the Zoning Administrator's
final decision by filing an appeal with the Plan Commission within 30
days of such decision. Following the final decision of the Plan
Commission, an aggrieved person may appeal such decision by filing an

§ 495-19. Subdivider's agreement. [Added 12-15-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-13]
appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days of the final
decision.
A. Generally. If the Village Board approves a division of land, condominium
plat, or replat that involves the installation of public and/or private
improvements or if the Village's approval requires a subdivider's
agreement, the subdivider shall provide a subdivider's agreement to the
Village Board and obtain approval of the same prior to any land altering
activity or as otherwise stipulated in the approval.
B. Village costs. The subdivider is responsible for reimbursing the Village
for all costs it incurs in the review and approval of a subdivider's
agreement, including work performed by Village staff or any consultant
or contract employee retained by the Village.
C. Amendment. Once a subdivider's agreement is accepted by the
subdivider and the Village Board, such agreement may only be
amended with the approval of both parties.
D. Public record. Although a subdivider's agreement is a private contract
between two parties, it is considered a public document.
E. Model agreement. The Village Administrator, Village Attorney, and
Village Engineer are authorized to jointly develop a model subdivider's
agreement for projects in the Village of East Troy that is consistent with
the provisions of this chapter and may make revisions to such
agreement from time to time as may be needed to address changes in
this chapter, state law, or best practices. The Village Clerk shall
maintain the most current version and provide copies to subdividers
and others upon request. [Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No.

§ 495-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-21
1:635
(1) The Village Board and Plan Commission, or their designees, shall
examine all final plats within the Village of East Troy and may
check for the accuracy and closure of the survey, the proper kind
and location of monuments, and legibility and completeness of the
drawing.
(2) Maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the
exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall not exceed, in
horizontal distance or position, the ratio of 1:10,000 nor, in
azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field
measurements exceed this maximum, new field measurements
shall be made until a satisfactory closure of the field measurements
has been obtained; the survey of the exterior boundary shall be
adjusted to form a closed geometric figure.
(3) All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed
geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed
exterior boundary survey. If checks disclose an error for any
interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of 1:5,000, or an error
in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle
where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer,
necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a
measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not
exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the quotient of 300
divided by the length of the shorter side; however, such error shall
not in any case exceed five minutes of arc.
(4) Where the plat is located within a quarter section, the corners of
which have been relocated, monumented, and coordinated by the
Village, the tie required by § 236.20(3)(b), Wis. Stats., may be
expressed in terms of grid bearing and distance, and the material
and Wisconsin state plane coordinates of the monument marking
the relocated section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied
shall be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of the
tie shall be determined by a closed survey meeting the error of
closure herein specified for the survey of the exterior boundaries of
the subdivision.
G. Surveying and monumenting. All final plats shall meet all the surveying
and monumenting requirements of § 236.15, Wis. Stats.
H. State plane coordinate system. Where the plat is located within a
quarter section, the corners of which have been relocated,
monumented and coordinated by the Village, the plat shall be tied
directly to one of the section or quarter corners so relocated,
monumented and coordinated. The exact grid bearing and distance of
such tie shall be determined by field measurements, and the material
and Wisconsin state plane coordinates of the monument marking the
relocated section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall be
indicated on the plat. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to

quarter section, the corners of which have been relocated,
monumented, and coordinated by the Village, the map shall be tied
directly to one of the section or quarter corners so relocated,
monumented and coordinated. The exact grid bearing and distance of
such tie shall be determined by field measurements, and the material
and Wisconsin state plane coordinates of the monument marking the
relocated section or quarter corner to which the map is tied shall be
indicated on the map. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to
the Wisconsin Coordinate System, South Zone, and adjusted to the
Village's control survey.
D. Certificates. The surveyor shall certify on the face of the certified
survey map that he/she has fully complied with all the provisions of this
chapter. The Village Board, after a recommendation by the reviewing
agencies, shall certify its approval on the face of the map.

Required Improvements
§ 495-23. General standards for improvements. [Amended
12-15-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-13]
A. General requirement. The subdivider is responsible for providing all
public and private improvements as may be required under this chapter
and/or the Village's approval. This requirement does not apply to land
divisions within the Village's extraterritorial jurisdiction.
B. Options.
(1) The required public improvements shall be installed by the
subdivider at his/her cost or:
(a) The subdivider may petition the Village for the installation of
the required public improvements through the special
assessment B bond process as provided for in § 66.0713(4),
Wis. Stats., or another acceptable special assessment process,
with the special assessments being payable at the time of lot
sale, payable in a maximum of seven annual installments
together with interest.
(b) The Village may enter into a recapture agreement with the
subdivider agreeing to require payment of recapture costs of
public improvements from those properties benefitting from
the improvements. The Village shall prohibit development on
those properties until payment has been made. The subdivider
may contract directly with adjacent property owners and/or
subdividers of adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize
and/or off-site improvements constructed.
(c) In addition to the above, the Village may enter into an
agreement to reimburse the subdivider, at the end of the sevenyear
period, for his/her cost (at the time of construction) of
those oversized improvements constructed within the
proposed land division but which are oversized to serve lands
beyond the boundaries of the land division or other lands
within the subdivider's control and which have not, during the
seven-year period, been reimbursed to the subdivider. Said
payment shall be only for the actual additional cost of
constructing the oversized improvements within the
boundaries of the land division and shall not provide for
payment of any interest. The Village shall then establish
special assessments against those benefitting properties
outside the proposed land division boundaries or the
subdivider's control for those costs. To be eligible to proceed
under this provision, the land division must occur within areas
identified in the Village's Comprehensive Plan or other adopted
comprehensive development or public facilities plan.
§ 495-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-23
1:639
(2) Any combination of the above as approved by the Village Board.
(3) If the Village finds that Village construction of such public
improvements would not be warranted as a special assessment to
the intervening properties or as a governmental expense until some
future time, the developer shall be required, if he/she wishes to
proceed with the development, to obtain necessary easements or
rights-of-way and construct and pay for such public improvement
extensions as provided under Subsection B(1) or (2) above.
C. Tax incremental districts. The requirement of installation, by the
subdivider, of the various improvements specified in this chapter shall
be subject to appropriate modification by vote of the Village Board in
the event that all or any part of the area encompassed by the plat is
included within an established tax incremental district (TID) with an
adopted project plan.
D. Construction standards. The required public improvements shall be
installed consistent with the engineering standards and specifications
adopted by the Village Board. Where standards and specifications have
not been adopted, the improvements shall be made consistent with
established engineering practices as approved by the Village Engineer.
When new or revised standards and/or specifications have been
adopted by the Village Board, work on public improvements not begun
within 18 months of the date of final plat adoption shall be made to the
new or revised standards and/or specifications and calculations for the
construction of the required public improvements.
E. Commencement of work. No construction or installation of any public
or private improvement or any land disturbing activity shall commence
until after:
(1) The Village Board approves the preliminary plat or preliminary
certified survey map;
(2) The subdivider complies with those conditions of approval which
must be satisfied before the commencement of work as enumerated
in this chapter and/or the Village Board's approval;
(3) The Village Engineer approves all required plans or permits,
including construction plans for streets, sidewalks, water supply
facilities, sanitary sewerage facilities, stormwater management,
grading, and erosion/sediment control; and
(4) The subdivider obtains all other approvals from other authorities as
may be required to undertake the construction or installation of
any public or private improvement or any land disturbing activity.
F. Completion of work. Prior to submitting a final plat or final certified
survey map for review, all public and private improvements shall be
completed by the subdivider and approved by the Village Engineer.
Upon petition by the subdivider, the Village Board may allow the

§ 495-24. Financial guarantees. [Amended 12-15-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-13]
subdivider to provide a cash bond or a letter of credit to secure the
installation of any required public and/or private improvement,
provided that the subdivider's agreement for the project addresses the
use and administration of the cash bond or letter of credit. The cash
bond or a letter of credit shall be equal to 115% of the estimated cost of
improvements and other fees, costs, and other money as determined by
the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer may from time to time adjust
the amount of estimated costs of said improvements, and within 30
days of written notice of said change the subdivider shall increase the
financial security by that amount or any other amount acceptable to the
Village Board. As the required improvements are installed and accepted
or for other purposes, the Village Board may authorize reductions of the
financial security in the amount deemed appropriate.
G. Approval of contractors and subcontractors required. Contractors and

(1) Bikeways shall be designed to serve both pedestrian and bicycle
traffic in areas where the majority of the adjoining lots do not have
frontage or access to the street, are not being served by a
bikeways, or in high traffic areas. In general, those lots which do
not front or have access on the street in question are not the
generating or terminating point for the pedestrian or bicycle
traffic.
(2) More specifically, bikeways shall be designed to transport the
majority of pedestrian or bike traffic through the area as opposed
to serving the adjoining lots as a sidewalk does.
(3) Bikeways shall not be installed in lieu of sidewalks. However, where
permitted by Village ordinance, persons may ride a bicycle upon
public sidewalks.
E. Construction standards. Bikeways shall be constructed according to

Code. The subdivider shall pay all the costs of all sanitary sewer work,
including the bringing of the sanitary sewer of adequate capacity and
depth from where it exists to the land division in question, as well as
providing all sanitary sewer work within the land division. Such
required improvements shall be dedicated to the Village upon such
terms and conditions as the Village Board may determine. If, at the time
of final platting, sanitary sewer facilities are not available to the plat but
§ 495-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-29
1:645
will become available within a period of 10 years from the date of
plat recording, the subdivider shall install or cause to be installed
sanitary sewers and sewer laterals to the street lot line in accordance
with this section and shall cap all laterals as may be specified by
the Village Engineer. In addition, the subdivider shall extend sanitary
sewer facilities to the limits of the subdivision property lines, unless
the Village Board determines that the land adjacent to the subdivision
is unlikely to require public sanitary sewer service within said time.
Any oversizing of sanitary sewer facilities required by the Village and
the recovery of costs associated with that oversizing shall be addressed
in a development agreement. [Amended 8-19-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-06]
C. Installation. Sanitary sewers, including all related items (manholes,

installing a twelve-inch sewer of the sewers necessary to serve the area
within the subdivision. The difference in the costs of the sewers
necessary to serve the subdivision and the costs of the sewers actually
installed, as determined by the Village Engineer, shall be borne by the
developer, with the right of recoupment from property owners or
developers of the areas served outside the subdivision, without inflation
or interest adjustment in the recoupment amount.
D. Construction standards. The subdivider shall construct sanitary sewers
in a manner as to make adequate sanitary sewerage service available to
each lot within the subdivision. Where public sanitary sewers of
adequate capacity are determined by the Village Engineer to be
available, extensions of the public sanitary sewer system shall be made
so as to provide sewer service to each lot. Gravity sanitary sewers shall
be extended to the land division and to each buildable lot in accordance
with Village comprehensive sanitary sewer plans as determined by the
Village Engineer. Sewerage service lines of the sizes and materials
required by the Village Engineer shall be installed from the sanitary
sewers to the property line of every lot in the subdivision. The size,
type, and installation of all sanitary sewers proposed to be constructed
shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved
by the Village Engineer. All sanitary sewer facilities shall be
floodproofed.

connect Village water to serve all lots subject to specifications and
inspection by Village utilities and the State of Wisconsin. Such required
improvements shall be dedicated to the Village upon such terms and
conditions as the Village Board may determine. The subdivider shall pay
all costs of connecting adequate Village water, including bringing water
supply facilities from where they exist to the land division in question,
providing all water works within the land division, and looping the
water supply facilities in all locations deemed important and financially
feasible by the Village Engineer. In addition, the subdivider shall extend
water supply facilities to the limits of the subdivision's property lines,
unless the Village Board determines that the land adjacent to the
subdivision is unlikely to require public water service within a period of
10 years from the date of the plat recording. The subdivider shall
provide for a minimum water main diameter of eight inches and the
location of public fire hydrants along the public streets at not greater
spacing than 450 feet for residential areas or 600 feet for commercial
areas. Fire hydrants which have not passed testing or have not been in
operation shall be covered with securely attached bags to preclude
their being inadvertently used by the Fire Department in an emergency
situation. Any oversizing of water supply facilities required by the

subdivider for payment. The Village Engineer shall conduct any
necessary final inspections of the improvements and forward a
report to the Village Clerk-Treasurer recommending either
approval or disapproval. When the engineering, inspection, and
legal fees, taxes and special assessments have been paid, and when
the necessary lien waivers and affidavits have been filed, the report
of the Village Engineer, together with the recommendation of the
Village Clerk-Treasurer, shall be forwarded to the Village Board for
approval and acceptance of the improvements and dedications.
C. Maintenance guarantee after final acceptance. Prior to final acceptance
of the required public improvements, the subdivider shall provide the
Village with a cash deposit or a letter of credit, in a form acceptable to
the Village Attorney, that is equal to 15% of the amount of the cash
deposit or letter of credit the subdivider provided the Village prior to
the start of construction or the largest amount allowed by law,
whichever is greater. If within one year of final acceptance the Village
Engineer determines that the public improvements need repair due to
faulty materials or workmanship or the subdivider damages Village
property and/or improvements, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall give
the subdivider a fourteen-day written notice to perform such repairs. If
the repairs are not begun within the fourteen-day period and completed
within a reasonable time thereafter, as determined by the Village
Board, the Village may complete the repairs. The cost of the repairs
shall be billed to the subdivider and paid by the subdivider within a
reasonable time, as determined by the Village Board, or taken out of the
cash deposit or letter of credit. If the Village draws against the cash
deposit or letter of credit, the subdivider shall, within 10 working days

The subdivider shall be required to grade the full land division in
accordance with the requirements of § 495-49.
§ 495-41. Street trees.
The Village Board may require the subdivider to plant at least one tree
of a species acceptable to the Village Board and of at least six feet in
height for each 50 feet of frontage on all streets proposed to be dedicated.
The required trees shall be planted in the lawn area of the right-of-way in
accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the Village
Engineer.
§ 495-42. Survey monumentation. [Added 12-15-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-13]
Before final approval of any final plat or certified survey map within the
corporate limits of the Village, the subdivider shall install monuments
consistent with the requirements of Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., or as may be
required by the Village Engineer. All survey monumentation located
adjacent to street or public rights-of-way, but not located within street
pavement, shall be protected with steel fence posts erected near the survey
monumentation. The Village Engineer may waive the placing of monuments
for a reasonable time during public improvement construction on condition
that the subdivider executes a surety to ensure the placing of such
monuments within the time required. The Village Clerk-Treasurer is
authorized to accept a letter of credit for monumentation on behalf of the
Village in an amount approved by the Village Engineer. Building permits
shall not be issued until all survey monumentation for the block(s) of lots
in which the lot(s) for which building permits are being applied for within
the phase of the land division under development has been installed. When
the land division includes an established 1/2, 1/4, 1/4-1/4, or other such
section monument, the established monument shall be preserved and/or
fully restored by the subdivider at his/her cost.
of such draw, replenish said moneys up to the aggregate amount.
This financial guarantee shall not be a bar to any action the Village
might have for negligent workmanship or materials. Wisconsin law on
negligence shall govern such situations.

subdivision, the owner shall conform to the provisions of Ch. 236, Wis.
Stats., and all applicable Village regulations. In all cases where the
requirements of this chapter are different from the requirements of
Chapter 236, the more restrictive provision shall apply. The provisions
of this article do not apply to land divisions within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
B. Dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate land and improve streets as
provided in this chapter and § 495-26. Streets shall be located with
regard for topographical conditions, natural features, existing and
proposed streets, utilities and land uses and public convenience and
safety. Streets shall conform to the Official Map adopted by the Village
Board. The subdivision, certified survey parcel or land division shall be
so designed as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public
street or road.
C. Compliance with Comprehensive Plan and ordinances.
(1) Compliance with statutes. In laying out a certified survey or
subdivision, the owner shall conform to the provisions of Ch. 236,
Wis. Stats., and all applicable Village regulations. In all cases
where the requirements of this chapter are different from the
requirements of Chapter 236, the more restrictive provision shall
apply. [Amended 8-19-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-07]
(2) The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of
all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map,
and to this chapter, and other Village planning documents, and
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
reasonable circulation of traffic, topographical conditions, runoff of
stormwater, public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
(3) The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provisions for the appropriate continuation at the same or greater
width of the existing streets in adjoining areas.
D. Areas not covered by official map or plan. In areas not covered by an
official map or a Village comprehensive plan, the layout of streets shall
conform to the plan for the most advantageous development of
adjoining areas of the neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and
located in relation to existing and officially planned streets, topography
and natural terrain, streams and lakes, and existing tree growth, public
§ 495-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-43
1:655
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
E. Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of
the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Village Board, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the
layout of the subdivision or land division, or for the advantageous
development of the adjacent tracts.
F. Street classifications. Streets shall be required and classified by the
Village Engineer in accordance with the Village's Comprehensive Plan
and, where not identified in said plan, in accordance with sound
engineering standards into the classifications indicated below with the
designated minimum widths:
(1) Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide
through traffic for a heavy volume of vehicles. Arterial streets as
defined herein shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to
centers of employment, centers of governmental activity,
community shopping areas, community recreation and points
beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be
properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed
system of major streets and highways and shall be, insofar as
practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned
streets with which they are to connect.
(2) Collector streets. Collector streets shall be arranged so as to
provide ready collection of traffic from individual areas and
conveyance to the arterial street and highway system and shall be
properly related to special traffic generators such as schools,
churches, and shopping centers and other concentrations of
population and to the major streets into which they feed.
(3) Local/minor streets. Local streets shall be arranged to conform to
the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the
design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to
require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and
convenient access to abutting property.
(4) Alleys. Alleys shall be located at rear property lines, discourage
through traffic, serve fewer than 50 vehicles a day, be intended to
provide access to off-street loading and service areas, and shall not
serve as primary access to parcels.
G. Reserve strips. Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to
control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is
placed with the Village under conditions approved by the Village Board.
H. Extraterritorial streets. Streets located in the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village shall provide for the dedication of the
minimum widths of right-of-way in accordance with the standards of
§ 495-43 EAST TROY CODE § 495-43
1:656
this chapter. Extraterritorial streets within the urban service area shall
be provided to the structural standards of this chapter and minimum
pavement widths of 24 feet and without curb and gutter. Other streets
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village shall meet or
exceed the town road standards of § 82.50, Wis. Stats.
I. Alleys.
(1) Commercial and industrial. Alleys may be provided in commercial
and industrial districts upon the Plan Commission's
recommendation. Where approved, the paved width of commercial
and industrial alleys shall be not less than 30 feet. Alley rights-ofway
shall be 50 feet. Alleys shall be constructed according to base
and surfacing requirements for streets.
(2) Residential. Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas except
within the SR-7 Traditional-Rear Residential Zoning District or if
necessary due to topography or other exceptional circumstances.
Where approved, the paved width of the right-of-way for residential
alleys shall be not less than 24 feet. Alleys shall be constructed
according to base and surfacing requirements for streets.
(3) Dead end. Dead-end alleys are prohibited except under very
unusual circumstances, and crooked and "T" alleys shall be
discouraged. Temporary dead-end streets shall not be over 1,000
feet in total length, shall provide for an eventual intersection
spacing meeting the requirements of this chapter, and shall provide
for a temporary cul-de-sac or turnaround as approved by the
Village Engineer.
J. Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets may only be used where
necessary to respond to the preservation of existing slopes or natural
features. Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently
closed shall not exceed 750 feet in length and shall terminate with a
circular turnaround having a right-of-way radius of 60 feet and a
minimum outside curb radius of 40 feet. The length of cul-de-sac streets
shall be measured from the line of intersection with the connecting
street to the farthest extent of the cul-de-sac bulb. In all culs-de-sac,
there shall be an unobstructed sight distance from the intersection of
the intersecting street to the far end of the cul-de-sac bulb.
K. Continuation. Streets shall be laid out to provide for possible
continuation wherever topographic and other physical conditions
permit. The use of culs-de-sac shall be held to a minimum, and
permanently dead-ended streets shall be prohibited. Provisions shall be
made so that all proposed streets shall have a direct connection with, or
be continuous and in line with, existing, planned, or platted streets with
which they are to connect.265
265. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 495-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-43
1:657
L. Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out so as to discourage
their use by through traffic.
M. Frontage roads. Where a land division abuts or contains an existing or
proposed arterial highway, or railroad right-of-way, the subdivider shall
provide a frontage road or reverse frontage road, platted access
restriction along the property contiguous to such highway, or such
other treatment as may be determined necessary by the Village
Engineer to ensure safe, efficient traffic flow and adequate protection of
residential properties.
N. Private streets. Private streets shall not be approved nor shall public
improvements be approved for any private street; all streets shall be
dedicated for public use.
O. Horizontal curves. When connecting street lines deflect from each other
at any one point by more than 5°, they shall be connected by a curve
with a radius of not less than 150 feet on local streets, 250 feet on
collector streets, and 450 feet on arterial streets.
P. Radii of curvature. When a continuous center line deflects at any one
point by more than 10°, a circular curve shall be introduced having a
radius of curvature on said center line of not less than the following:
(1) Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet.
(2) Collector streets: 300 feet.
(3) Minor streets: 100 feet.
Q. Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be required between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
R. Street grades.
(1) Maximum grade.
(a) Unless necessitated by exceptional topography, subject to the
approval of the Village Board, the maximum center-line grade
of any street or public way shall not exceed the following:
[1] Arterial streets: 6%.
[2] Collector streets: 8%.
[3] Minor streets, alleys and frontage streets: 10%.
[4] Pedestrianways: 12%, unless steps of acceptable design
are provided.
(b) The grade of any street shall in no case exceed 10% or be less
than 1/2%.
§ 495-43 EAST TROY CODE § 495-43
1:658
(2) Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to
avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover
and tree growth, and general leveling of the topography.266
S. Vertical curves. All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length, in feet, equivalent to 20 times the
algebraic difference in the rate of grade for major thoroughfares and 1/
2 this minimum length for all other streets.
T. Half streets. Half streets shall not be platted unless necessary to
provide the full width of an existing street platted to half width. All
newly platted streets shall be platted to the required full width. Where a
half street exists adjacent to a proposed land division, the subdivider
shall endeavor to acquire and dedicate the remaining half street.
U. Intersections.
(1) Angle of intersect. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly
right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good
design permit. A curved street shall intersect another street with
not less than 15 feet of tangent right-of-way between the end of
curvature and the right-of-way of the street being intersected.
(2) Number of streets converging. The number of streets converging at
one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not
more than two. Cross-type intersections on local streets shall be
avoided whenever possible in favor of T-type intersections.
Intersections of local streets shall be at least 125 feet from each
other.
(3) Number of intersections on arterial streets. The number of
intersections along arterial streets shall be held to a minimum.
Wherever practicable, the distance between such intersections
shall be not less than 1,200 feet, unless otherwise determined by
the Village Engineer to provide better safety.
(4) Local street spacing. Local streets and frontage roads intersecting
with other local streets or collector streets shall, wherever
practicable, be spaced no closer than 150 feet between right-of-way
lines, nor closer than 250 feet to the right-of-way of an arterial
street.
(5) Property lines at street intersections. Property lines at street
intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of 25 feet or
of a greater radius when required by the Village Engineer.
(6) Local streets. Local streets shall not necessarily continue across
arterial or collector streets, but if the center lines of such local
streets approach the major streets from opposite sides within 300
266. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 495-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-43
1:659
feet of each other, measured along the center line of the arterial
or collector streets, then the location shall be so adjusted that the
adjoining across the major or collector street is continuous and a
jog is avoided.
(7) Additional sight easements. At any intersection determined by the
Village Engineer, restricted development easements or additional
street right-of-way shall be platted to provide for adequate sight
distances in every direction of travel. At a minimum, the subdivider
shall grade, clear, or otherwise provide for an unobstructed sight
triangle at all intersections incorporating the area within a triangle
formed by the intersection of the street right-of-way lines and a
point on each right-of-way line being not less than 30 feet from the
intersection point.
V. Street names.
(1) New street names shall not duplicate the names of existing streets,
but streets that are continuations of others already in existence and
named shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street names
shall be subject to approval by the Village Board.
(2) All streets shall be named in conformity with the street naming
plan of the Village or with adjoining streets. In the case of diverging
streets, the name shall be repeated. New street names shall not
duplicate the names of existing streets. Long or continuous
thoroughfares running north and south shall be named avenues;
those running east and west shall be named streets; diagonal
thoroughfares shall be named roads; and curving thoroughfares
shall be named drives. Short or discontinuous thoroughfares
running north and south shall be named courts; those running east
and west shall be named places; diagonal thoroughfares shall be
named ways; and curving thoroughfares shall be named lanes.
W. Limited access highway and railroad right-of-way treatment. Whenever
the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access
highway, arterial street, or railroad right-of-way, the design shall
provide the following treatment:
(1) Subdivision lots. When lots within the proposed subdivision back
upon the right-of-way of an existing or proposed limited access
highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth shall
be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the
normal lot depth. This strip shall be part of the platted lots but shall
have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This
strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs. The building of
structures hereon prohibited."
(2) Commercial and industrial districts. Commercial and industrial
districts shall have provided on each side of the limited access
highway, arterial street, or railroad streets approximately parallel
to and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for the
§ 495-43 EAST TROY CODE § 495-43
1:660
§ 495-44. Construction and dedication of streets and roads.
appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or
railroad, but not less than 150 feet.
(3) Streets parallel to a limited access highway. Streets parallel to a
limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting
a major street and highway or collector street which crosses said
railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of 250
feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance,
where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for the future
separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(4) Minor streets. Minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to
railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided, and location of minor
streets immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways and
to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas.
X. Minimum right-of-way and roadway width. The minimum right-of-way
(ROW) and roadway width shall follow the Comprehensive Plan and
Official Map or, if no width is specified therein, the minimum widths

A. General requirements.
(1) Construction standards. All roadway construction and materials
used shall be performed in accordance with the construction
methods as listed in the appropriate sections of the State of
Wisconsin Department of Transportation Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction, and its supplements, and this
chapter, whichever is more restrictive. The design requirements of
this section and § 495-43 shall be applicable to all streets and roads
that are to be dedicated to the Village, regardless of whether such
streets or roads are part of a new subdivision or land division.
§ 495-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-44
1:661
Design requirements for the pavement shall be adequate for the
zoning classification of the area served by the subject street. A
street which divides areas with different zoning classifications shall
be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the area
requiring the higher quality pavement. Any variation of this must
have prior approval of the Village Engineer. Combination concrete
curb and gutter is required on all streets. (See § 495-27.) A copy
of all design assumptions and computations on which the proposed
design is based shall be submitted to the Village Engineer.
(2) Project costs. All roadway surveys, dedications, plans,
specifications, and construction will be at the expense of the
applicant. This includes any expense incurred by the Village in the
preparation of plans and review and inspection of plans and
construction.
(3) Preliminary consultation. Prior to the design, preparation, and
construction of any roadway to be dedicated to the Village of East
Troy, the applicant shall notify the Village Engineer. An on-site
meeting with the applicant and the Village Engineer will then be
arranged by the Village Engineer. Plans must be provided in order
for the Village Engineer to check the design and the drainage.
(4) Material slips. Copies of material slips for all materials furnished
for the road construction projects shall be delivered to the Village
before the Village approves the final construction.
(5) Required inspections. Prior to the commencement of any street
construction, the subdivider shall notify the Village Engineer at
least one workday in advance as to the nature of the work being
done. The Village Engineer shall be contacted for required
inspections after the following phases of construction: subbase
grading; crushed aggregate base course; concrete gutters, curbs
and sidewalks; bituminous surface course; and shouldering. Any
deficiencies found by the Village Engineer shall be corrected before
proceeding to the next phase of construction.267
(6) Tests of materials. The Village reserves the right to obtain a sample
of the roadway base material prior to placement on the roadway for
purposes of determining whether the material meets gradation and
soundness requirements.
(7) Pavement samples. Samples of bituminous concrete may be taken
by the Village during pavement construction operations for the
purpose of determining that the material meets specifications.
B. Construction standards. All streets and highways constructed in the
Village or to be dedicated to the Village shall fully comply with the
267. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 495-44 EAST TROY CODE § 495-44
1:662
following construction standards and shall be adequate for the zoning
classifications or projected use of the area served by the street.
(1) General. After completion of the underground utilities and approval
thereof, the streets shall be constructed. Unless phasing of
construction of improvements is approved by the Village Board or
its designee, building permits shall not be issued prior to the
installation of the street improvements and the approval of an
individual lot grading plan that conforms to the guidelines of the
master site grading plan, as determined by the Village Engineer or
his/her designee.
(2) Street rights-of-way. Streets shall have a right-of-way width as
established on the Official Map or as designated in § 495-43X;
provided, however, that a greater or lesser roadway width may be
required by the Village Engineer where necessary to assure
uniformity along the entire length of any street.
(3) Temporary streets. Construction of temporary streets shall require
authorization of the Plan Commission.
(4) Standard street improvements.
(a) Standard street improvements shall include streetlights,
concrete curb and gutter, bituminous base course, bituminous
surface course, and, when required, walkways.
(b) The construction of standard street improvements can begin
only when either the underground utilities were installed in the
previous construction season or the construction of
underground utilities included mechanical compaction and
compaction tests have been approved by the Village Engineer.
(c) Upon obtaining the written approval of the Village Engineer,
the subdivider can proceed with the construction of the
standard street improvements. Standard street improvements
shall be installed to the boundary line of the subdivision unless
the street culminates in a cul-de-sac, the topography or other
physical conditions make it impossible to do so, or unless this
requirement is waived, in writing, by the Plan Commission.
(d) Where he/she deems appropriate, the Village Engineer may
require that pavement construction take place over a two-year
period, with the lower coat being placed in the same year as
the underground utilities are constructed and with the upper
coat being placed in the following year, after thorough cleaning
and application of a tack coat to the first coat.
(5) Roadway base standards.
(a) The subdivider must bring all streets and alleys to a grade
established by the Village Board. All site work by Village
§ 495-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-44
1:663
employees in determining grade shall be billed at the Village
rate and paid by the owner.
(b) Residential streets shall have a roadway base of six inches
minimum compacted in place crushed aggregate base course
of Gradation No. 2 in the top layer and Gradation No. 1 and No.
2 in the lower level.
(c) On commercial, arterial or other heavy use streets, as
determined by the Village Engineer, a base course of eight
inches minimum compacted shall be constructed upon an
inspected and approved subgrade.
(d) In the case of commercial, arterial, or other heavy use roads,
the Village Board may, in the alternative to the above
standards, have the Village Engineer provide specifications for
such roads after researching the site and conducting a soil
analysis pursuant to Subsection B(8)(c) below.
(e) In any case, the Village Board shall have the sole discretion in
determining the use and construction classification to be
adhered to.
(f) In all cases, the base course shall be compacted to the extent
necessary to produce a condition so that there will be no
appreciable displacement of material laterally and
longitudinally under traffic and shall conform to line, grades,
and shape shown on the approved plans, profiles, and cross
sections.
(g) The subdivider shall furnish drawings which indicate the
proposed grades of streets shown on the plat and, after
approval of those grades by the Village Engineer and adoption
by the Village Board, the streets shall be graded to full width of
the right-of-way of the proposed street to the subgrade
elevations shown on the typical cross section. The grading is to
be completed prior to installation of utilities. All stumps and
trees which cannot be saved, boulders and other similar items
shall be removed by the subdivider.
(6) Roadway subgrade quality. If deemed necessary by the Village
Engineer, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests may be required
according to the following standards:
(a) All subgrade material shall have a minimum CBR of three.
Subgrade material having a CBR less than three shall be
removed and replaced with a suitable fill material or the
pavement must be designed to compensate for the soil
conditions. The soil support CBR values selected for use by the
designer should represent a minimum value for the soil to be
used.
§ 495-44 EAST TROY CODE § 495-44
1:664
(b) Stable and nonorganic subbase material is required. All topsoil
shall be first removed. In addition, all subsoils which have a
high shrink-swell potential, low bearing capacity when wet, or
are highly elastic shall be removed and used outside of the
right-of-way. Where both subsoil and substratum have a high
shrink-swell potential and low bearing capacity when wet, an
underdrain system shall be installed to keep the water level
five feet below the pavement surface. Unstable and organic
material must be subcut, removed and replaced with a suitable
granular or breaker-run material approved by the Village
Engineer.
(7) Roadway grading; ditches. Roads shall be graded to their full width
in accordance with approved plans, plus an additional distance
necessary to establish a four-to-one backslope where ditches are
allowed. The roadway shall be compacted and graded to a
subgrade using, where necessary, approved fill material in
accordance with Wisconsin Department of Transportation
standards. Roadside ditches, where allowed by the Village, shall be
a minimum of 26 inches below the finished roadway center-line
elevation or as approved by the Village Engineer. Debris may not be
buried in the designated road right-of-way. Roadway ditches shall
have a normal slope ratio of three-to-one ditch from the edge of the
shoulder to the bottom of the ditch and two-to-one on the back
slope.
(8) Pavement thickness.
(a) Residential and rural type roads shall have a minimum of 2 1/2
inches thick compacted hot mix bituminous concrete
pavement, placed in two layers, a binder course of 1 1/2 inches
thick and a surface of one inch.
(b) On commercial, arterial or other heavy use roads, there shall
be a minimum of 3 1/2 inches of bituminous concrete
pavement, placed in two layers, a binder course of two inches
thick and a surface course of 1 1/2 inches thick.
(c) In the case of commercial, arterial or other heavy use roads,
the Village Board may, in the alternative to the above
standards, have the Village Engineer provide specifications for
paving such roads with a greater thickness after researching
the site(s) and conducting a soil analysis. In any case, the
Village Board shall have the sole discretion in determining the
use and construction classification to be adhered to. In no
event shall paving occur later than 18 months from the

to abutting street center lines. Lot lines shall follow Village boundary
lines.
I. Double and reversed frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed
frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide
separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
J. Natural features. In the dividing of any land, regard shall be shown for
all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic spots,
or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and
stability to the proposed development.
K. Land remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after
dividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots or a plan shown
as to future use rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
L. Large lots. In case a tract is divided and results in parcels of more than
twice the minimum lot size provided for by Chapter 510, Zoning, of this
Code for the zoning district in which the land is located, such parcels
shall be so arranged to permit redividing into parcels in accordance
with this chapter and with Chapter 510, Zoning.

Engineer to obtain building sites that are not subject to flooding
from a post-development one-hundred-year storm.
(2) Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and
any otherwise unplattable lands which lie between a proposed
subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots,
outlots or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream.
A. Purpose. The following provisions in this section are established to
preserve and provide properly located public sites and facilities for
drainage and stormwater management as the community develops and
to ensure that the costs of providing and developing such public sites
are equitably apportioned on the basis of serving the need for the
management of increased stormwater quantities resulting from land
development.

§ 495-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-47
1:671
(2) Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from
all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be
designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from
each lot to adjacent lots.
(3) The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any
subdivision plat which does not provide adequate means for
stormwater or floodwater runoff. Any stormwater drainage system
will be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system.
Storm sewers, where necessary, shall be designed in accordance
with all governmental regulations, and a copy of design
computations for engineering capacities shall accompany plans
submitted by the planning engineer for the final plat. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point,
no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and
basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point.
C. Drainage system plans.
(1) The subdivider shall submit to the Village at the time of filing a final
plat a drainage plan or engineering report on the ability of existing
watercourse channels, storm sewers, culverts, and other
improvements pertaining to drainage or flood control within the
subdivision to handle the additional runoff which would be
generated by the development of the land within the subdivision
consistent with the requirements of Chapter 483, Article II, Post-
Construction Stormwater Management, of this Code. Additional
information shall be submitted to adequately indicate that
provision has been made for disposal of surface water without any
damage to the developed or undeveloped land downstream or
below the proposed subdivision. The report shall also include:271
(a) Estimates of the quantity of stormwater entering the
subdivision naturally from areas outside the subdivision.
(b) Quantities of flow at each inlet or culvert.
(c) Location, sizes, and grades of required culverts, storm
drainage sewers and other required appurtenances.
(2) A grading plan for the streets, blocks, and lots shall be submitted
by the subdivider for the area within the subdivision.
(3) The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be consistent
with the requirements of Chapter 483, Article II, Post-Construction
Stormwater Management, of this Code.272

specifications provided by the Village Engineer.
D. Drainage system requirements. The subdivider shall install all the
storm drainage facilities indicated on the plans required in Subsection
C of this section necessary to serve, and resulting from, the phase of the
land division under development.
(1) All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage
system. The street storm system shall serve as the minor drainage
system and shall be designed to carry street, adjacent land, and
building stormwater drainage. Stormwater shall not be permitted
to be run into the sanitary sewer system within the proposed
subdivision.
(2) The design of the off-street major drainage system shall include the
entire watershed affecting the land division and shall be extended
to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
When the drainage system is outside of the street right-of-way, the
subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating an easement
pursuant to Subsection F to the Village to provide for the future
maintenance of said system.
E. Protection of drainage systems. The subdivider shall adequately protect
all ditches to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. Ditches and open
channels shall be seeded, sodded or paved depending upon grades and
soil types. Generally ditches or channels with grades up to 1% shall be
seeded, those with grades up to 4% shall be sodded, and those graded
over 4% shall be paved.
F. Drainage easements. Where a land division is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream:
(1) There shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage rightof-
way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse
and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate
for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this
section.
(2) The watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream may be
relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of adequate
drainage will be assured and the same provided with a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the
relocated watercourse and such further width or construction, or
both, as will be adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to
comply with this section.
(3) Wherever possible, drainage shall be maintained in an easement by
an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume flow. In all cases, such easements shall
§ 495-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-47
1:673
be of a minimum width established at the high-water mark or, in
the absence of such specification, not less than 30 feet.
(4) Whenever a parcel is to be subdivided or consolidated and
embraces any part of a drainageway identified on a Village
stormwater management plan, comprehensive plan, and/or official
map, or any portion thereof, such part of said existing or proposed
public drainageway shall be platted and dedicated by the
subdivider as an easement or right-of-way in the location and at the
size indicated, along with all other streets and public ways in the
land division. Whenever any parcel is to be subdivided or
consolidated and is part of a drainage district established under the
authority of Ch. 88, Wis. Stats., the subdivider shall petition the
Circuit Court to transfer the jurisdiction of that portion of the
drainage district being subdivided or consolidated to the Village in
accordance with § 88.83, Wis. Stats.
G. Dedication/preservation of stormwater management facilities. The
subdivider shall dedicate sufficient land area for the storage of
stormwater to meet the needs to be created by the proposed land
development, and in accordance with the standards for on-site
detention, and as determined by the Village Engineer. Whenever a
proposed stormwater management facility (e.g., detention or retention
basin), in whole or in part, is depicted on Village plans, such as the
Official Map, as a regional facility within the proposed land division,
ground areas for providing the required storage capacity in such
proposed public facility shall be dedicated to the public to the
requirements of the plan and/or Official Map. Storage areas necessary
to serve areas outside the land division shall be held in reserve for a
period of five years from the date of final plat approval for future
dedication to the Village or other appropriate agency. Storage facilities
required and not shown on the Official Map as a regional facility shall
be owned and maintained by the subdivider/subsequent owners'
association. A maintenance agreement shall be prepared in accordance
with the requirements of Chapter 483, Article II, Post-Construction
Stormwater Management, of this Code.273
H. Storm drainage facilities. The subdivider, at his/her cost, shall install all
drainage facilities identified in the required erosion control plan or
determined by the Village Engineer as being necessary for the
management of all lands and roadways within the development. In
addition, drainage capacity through the development from other areas
shall be provided in accordance with a comprehensive surface water
management study, if applicable. All required storm drainage facilities
shall be constructed and operational prior to acceptance of any
dedications and/or public improvements served by the storm drainage
facilities.

I. Minor drainage system. The subdivider shall install all minor drainage
system components necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages
from frequent storms. Minor drainage components shall include all
inlets, piping, gutters, channels, ditching, pumping, and other facilities
designed to accommodate the post-development runoff resulting from a
ten-year, twenty-four-hour rainfall event as determined in the most
current edition of the Natural Resources Conservation Service
Technical Release 55 (TR 55). Temporary accumulations of storm runoff
from ponding or flowing water, in or near minor system components,
shall be permitted provided that such accumulations do not allow the
water to flow across the crown of the street from one side to the other.
For arterial streets and streets located in commercial districts, ponding
within normal traffic lanes (10 feet on each side of the center line of the
street) is prohibited. In drainageways and drainageway easements,
accumulations of water shall not inundate beyond the limits of the
drainageway or drainageway easement. Cross-street drainage channels
(valley gutters) shall not be permitted except on cul-de-sac or
permanent dead-end streets serving fewer than 10 dwelling units and
where the minimum grade in the valley gutter and street gutter
between the valley gutter and the next downstream drainage inlet is not
less than 1%.274
J. Major drainage system. The subdivider shall install all major drainage
system components necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages
from infrequent storms. Major system components shall include large
channels and drainageways, streets, easements and other paths and
shall be capable of accommodating post-development runoff in excess
of that accommodated by minor system components resulting from
twenty-four-hour rainfall events for storms with return frequencies
greater than two years up to and including the one-hundred-year return
event (as identified in TR 55). Runoff resulting from a one-hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour rainfall event shall be contained within the street
right-of-way or designated storm drainage easement or detention
facility consistent with the requirements of Chapter 483, Article II,
Post-Construction Stormwater Management, of this Code.275
K. Drainage piping systems.
(1) Unless otherwise approved by the Village Engineer, all drainage
piping of 12 inches diameter and greater in street right-of-way shall
be constructed of Class 3 reinforced concrete pipe. Piping

shall be restored, reconnected or connected to public storm
drainage facilities.
L. Open channel systems.
(1) Where open channels are utilized in either the minor or major
drainage system, they shall be designed so as to minimize
maintenance requirements and maximize safety. Drainage
easements (in lieu of dedications) shall be utilized to accommodate
open channels and provide adequate access by the Village for
maintenance of drainage capacity. Side slopes shall not exceed a
four-to-one slope. Drainageways, where subject to high
groundwater, continuous flows, or other conditions, shall have a
paved concrete invert of not less than eight feet wide and side
slopes to a point one foot above the channel invert.
(2) In areas where invert paving is not required, the drainageway
bottom shall be grass. If the drainageway has a bare soil bottom or
the natural grasses in the drainageway are disturbed due to
development operations, the drainageway bottom shall be sodded
and securely staked to one foot above the elevation of inundation
resulting from a predevelopment five-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event. Other disturbed areas shall be seeded and prepared in
accordance with the Village's erosion control requirements (see
§ 495-35). Velocities for grass-lined channels shall not exceed those
presented in the Village's surface water management study, if one
is adopted.
M. Standards for on-site detention storage. When the subdivider employs
on-site detention to control erosion and sedimentation, reduce the postdevelopment
peak runoff rate, or temporarily store stormwater runoff
due to inadequate downstream drainage facilities, the detention
(storage) facilities shall comply with the requirements in Chapter 383,
Article II, Post-Construction Stormwater Management, of this Code.276

§ 495-50. Erosion control.
The Village finds that urbanized land uses have accelerated the process
of soil erosion, runoff, and sedimentation in the waters of the Village.
Therefore, it is declared to be the purpose of this section to control and
prevent soil erosion and minimize stormwater runoff increases and thereby
to preserve the natural resources, control floods, and prevent impairment of
dams and reservoirs, protect the quality of public waters, protect wildlife,
protect the tax base, and protect and promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the people of the Village. All land disturbing activities shall be

E. Drainage flows. The subdivider shall cause to be set upon the master
grading plan arrows indicating the directions of drainage flows for each
property line not fronting on a street on all parcels and along each
street as will result from the grading of the site, the construction of the
required public improvements, or which are existing drainage flows and
will remain. The arrows indicating the directions of flows shall be
appropriately weighted so as to differentiate between the minor and
major (one-hundred-year event) drainage components. The arrows shall
be accompanied on the master grading plan with the following note.
"Arrows indicate the direction of drainage flow in various components
resulting from site grading and the construction of required public
improvements. The drainage flow components located in easements
shall be maintained and preserved by the property owner unless
approved by the Village Engineer."

ARTICLE VIII
Park and Public Land Dedications
§ 495-51. General requirements.
§ 495-52. Land dedication.
A. Dedication requirements. In order that adequate open spaces and sites
for public uses may be properly located and reserved, and in order that
the cost of providing public areas, such as but not limited to parks,
recreation areas, and public schools, may be equitably apportioned on
the basis of additional need created by a certified survey or subdivision
development, each subdivider shall be required to dedicate land or pay
fees in lieu of land for park or other public uses. The provisions of this
article do not apply to land divisions within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
B. General design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, planned
development, or certified survey, provision shall be made for suitable
sites of adequate area for schools, parks, playgrounds, open spaces,
drainageways, and other public purposes. Such sites are to be shown on
the preliminary plat and final plat and shall comply with the
Comprehensive Plan or Park and Open Space Plan. Consideration shall
be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees,
marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds, ravines and
woodlands, prairie and wetlands, and plant and animal communities.
A. Dedication of sites. Where feasible and compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan or Park and Open Space Plan, the subdivider shall
provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide for park,
recreation, school, and open space needs of the land development
within the Village of East Troy. The location of such land to be dedicated
shall be determined by the Village Board. Where the dedication is not
compatible with the Comprehensive Plan or for other reasons is not
feasible as determined by the Village Board, the subdivider shall, in lieu
thereof, pay to the Village a fee as established by this article, or a
combination thereof.278
B. Dedication of parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces. The
subdivider shall dedicate sufficient land area to provide adequate park,
playground, recreation, and open space to meet the needs to be created
by and to be provided for the land division. Within the corporate limits
of the Village, whenever a proposed playground, park, or other public
land, other than streets or drainageways, designated in the
Comprehensive Plan or Official Map is embraced, all or in part, in a
tract of land to be subdivided, these proposed public lands shall be
made a part of the plat and dedicated to the public by the subdivider at
the following rate:
278. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 495-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-52
1:681
(1) Within the corporate limits of the Village, whenever a subdivision
plat or condominium plat is presented to the Village Board, the
Village Board shall, at its sole option, require the subdivider to
dedicate to the public land at the rate of $1,651 per unit in the
proposed development or require the donation of funds or a
combination of land/equipment/funds at the same value. The land
donated by the subdivider shall be valued at $40,000 per acre
(based upon a 2005 public needs assessment which was used to
determine the $1,651). Any donated land must be capable of being
developed as a neighborhood park, as determined by the Village
Board.
(2) Public lands designated in a plan or map and required to be
dedicated which are in excess of the aforesaid rate shall be
reserved for a period not to exceed five years, unless extended by
mutual agreement, for acquisition by the Village at undeveloped
land costs.
(3) Outside the corporate limits of the Village, but within the
extraterritorial limits, the subdivider may be required to reserve
such proposed public lands as may be recommended by the Plan
Commission as necessary for parks and open spaces, for a period
not to exceed five years, for acquisition at undeveloped land costs
by the municipality with appropriate jurisdiction.
(4) Within the corporate limits of the Village, whenever the
Comprehensive Plan, Park and Open Space Plan, or Official Map
does not embrace proposed playground, park, or other public
lands, other than streets and drainageways, in order that adequate
open space and sites for public use may be properly located and
preserved as the community develops, and in order that the cost of
providing the public park and recreation sites and facilities
necessary to serve the additional families brought into the
community by the subdivision may be most equitably apportioned
on the basis of the additional need created by the individual
subdivision development, the subdivider shall, in the design of the
plat or certified survey map, dedicate a public site for future public
use in the development of parks and recreational needs servicing
the subdivision. The minimum amount of land to be provided by the
subdivider by dedication shall be the same as provided for in
Subsection B(1).
C. Minimum size of park and playground dedications.
(1) In general, land reserved for recreation purposes shall have an
area of at least one acre. Where the amount of land to be dedicated
is less than one acre, the Village Board may require that the
recreation area be located at a suitable place on the edge of the
proposed land division, subdivision or certified survey so that
additional land may be added at such time that the adjacent land is
subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than one acre be
§ 495-52 EAST TROY CODE § 495-52
1:682
reserved for recreational purposes if it will be impractical or
impossible to secure additional lands in order to increase its area.
(2) Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of a character and
location suitable for use as a playground, play field, or for other
recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry. A
recreation site shall have a total frontage on one or more streets of
at least 100 feet in length, and no other dimensions of the site shall
be less than 100 feet.
D. Fees in lieu of land.
(1) In the event that dedication would result in sites too small to be
usable, or if the Comprehensive Plan or Park and Open Space Plan
calls for such public sites or open spaces to be located elsewhere,
or if the land to be dedicated would not be adaptable to meet
desirable on-site facilities, or if such sites would not otherwise be
suitable, a payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication shall be
required. Factors used in evaluation the adequacy of proposed park
and open space areas shall include size and shape, topography,
geology, tree and other plant cover, access, and location. The
amount of such fee shall be equivalent to the value of the required
dedication. Such fee shall be deposited in a nonlapsing fund to be
used exclusively for park and recreation development, including
site acquisition and related capital improvements.
(2) Where the division results in the creation of not more than one
additional lot or parcel, payment shall be required only for the
additional parcel; no payment shall be required for a parcel on
which a permanent residential structure has existed for at least one
year prior to the date of final plat approval.
(3) Where a lot or parcel for which payment has once been made is
further divided, payment shall be required only for the additional
lots or parcels created.
(4) Where payment is made in lieu of dedication, it shall be made in
cash, in one lump sum (100%), at the time of approval of the final
plat or certified survey map. Where stage development of a
subdivision is approved by the Village Board, it may limit payments
in lieu of dedication to the area of the subdivision being developed,
the entire fee for the first stage being due and payable at the time
of final approval of the plat, and the entire fee for each phase
subsequent to the first shall be due and payable prior to the start of
work on each phase.
(5) The Village Board may, in its sole discretion, permit the subdivider
to satisfy the requirements of this article by combining a land
dedication with a fee payment. If 25% of the required dedication is
made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to 75%
of the required per-unit fee in lieu of land. If 50% of the required
dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount
§ 495-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-52
1:683
§ 495-53. Reservation of additional land.
When public parks and sites for other public areas are shown on the
Comprehensive Plan or Park and Open Space Plan within the proposed
area for development and are greater in area than required by § 495-52,
the owner shall reserve for acquisition by the Village, through agreement,
purchase or condemnation, the remaining greater public area for a period
of one year from final plat approval unless extended by mutual agreement.
§ 495-54. Development of park area.
equal to 50% of the required per-unit fee in lieu of land. If 75%
of the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also
contribute an amount equal to 25% of the required per-unit fee in
lieu of land.
(6) The Village shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions
of this section in a separate account to be used at the discretion of
the Village Board in any community park, for developing adequate
parks, playgrounds, recreation, and open spaces.
E. Suitability of lands. The Village Board shall have sole authority to
determine the suitability and adequacy of parklands proposed for
dedication. Drainageways, wetlands, or areas reserved for streets shall
not be considered as satisfying land dedication requirements.
F. Access to dedicated land. All dedicated land shall have frontage on a
public street and shall have unrestricted public access.
G. Utility extensions. The subdivider shall install or provide for installation
of water and sanitary sewer lines to the property line of all dedicated
land, where such services are to be provided to the adjacent properties.
A. When parklands are dedicated to the Village, the subdivider is required
to:
(1) Properly grade and contour for proper drainage.
(2) Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area as
approved by the Village Engineer.
(3) Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of four inches of quality
topsoil, seed as specified by the Village Engineer and mulch, as
specified in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, Sections 627 and 629. The topsoil furnished for the
park site shall consist of the natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam,
silty clay loam or clay loam humus-bearing soils adapted to the
sustenance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither
excessively acid nor excessively alkaline. Fine grading and seeding
must occur within one year following issuance of the first building
permit within that land division unless otherwise authorized by the
Village. The improved area shall not be deemed officially accepted
§ 495-52 EAST TROY CODE § 495-54
1:684
until a uniform grass cover to a two-inch height has been
established. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to
maintain the area until the Village accepts the dedication.
B. It shall be the responsibility of the Village to maintain the dedicated
areas upon their dedication and acceptance to the Village.
C. A neighborhood park area shall be provided by the subdivider with a
standard residential water service, unless located directly adjacent to a
fire hydrant. A community park area shall be provided by the developer
with a minimum six-inch water service or at least one fire hydrant, and
at least one four-inch sanitary sewer lateral, all located at the street
property line.
D. The Village Board may require certification of compliance with this
article by the subdivider. The cost of such report shall be paid by the
subdivider.
E. If the subdivider fails to satisfy the requirements of this section, the
Village Board may contract said completion and bill such costs to the
subdivider, following a written notice to the subdivider of
noncompliance. Failure to pay such costs may result in the immediate
withholding of all building permits until such costs are paid.
F. The subdivider shall pay all costs of public improvements in the public
streets adjacent to or within all public and/or park lands.

Administration and Enforcement
§ 495-57. Variances and exceptions.
A. Where the subdivider alleges that extraordinary hardships or particular
difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, he/
she may request variances or exceptions to the regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such variance or exception shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. Application for any
such variance shall be made in writing by the subdivider to the Village
Clerk-Treasurer at the time when the preliminary plat or certified
survey is filed for consideration, stating fully all facts relied upon by the
petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or other
additional data which may aid Village officials in the analysis of the
proposed project. The plans for such development shall include such
covenants, restrictions or other legal provisions necessary to guarantee
the full achievement of the plan. The Village Clerk-Treasurer may
request that the Village Engineer, Village Attorney, or other officials
review each situation to ensure that the request is consistent with the
requirements and standards of this chapter. The Village Clerk-
Treasurer shall refer the matter to the Plan Commission with a written
report and recommendations from the Village staff. The Plan
Commission shall make a recommendation to the Village Board. The
previous granting of variances or exceptions in the same or similar
circumstances shall not of itself constitute grounds for the granting of a
variance or exception, nor shall strictly financial rationale.282
B. The Plan Commission shall not recommend, nor shall the Village Board
grant, variances or exceptions to the regulations of this chapter unless
it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:283
(1) Failure to grant the variance may be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is
located.
(2) The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property.
(3) Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished

from a mere inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed
hardship, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out.
(4) There would be no costs, present or future, to the Village resulting
from the granting of the variance or exception.
C. A variance may be granted by the Village Board, upon receiving a
positive recommendation of the Plan Commission, to permit a parcel to
be created by a proposed land division in the extraterritorial
jurisdiction when it is shown that the application satisfies the following
standards:
(1) A finding of fact must be made that the purpose of the proposed
parcel is to be a lot for a dwelling unit which is to be occupied by a
person who, or a family at least one member of which, earns a
substantial part of his or her livelihood from farm operations on the
parcel, and/or contributes work which is substantially needed in
the farm operation, and is the parent or child of the farm operator
or the spouse of the farm operator; and
(2) A finding of public interest must be made that the proposed parcel
and development design are reasonable upon consideration of
these factors:
(a) The potential for conflict with agricultural use.
(b) The need of the proposed development for a location in an
agricultural area.
(c) The availability of alternative locations.
(d) Compatibility with existing or permitted development on
adjacent lands.
(e) The productivity of the lands involved.
(f) The location of the proposed development so as to reduce to a
minimum the amount of productive agricultural land
converted.
(g) The need for public services created by the proposed
development.
(h) The availability of adequate public services and the ability of
affected local units of government to provide them without a
reasonable burden.
(i) The effect of the proposed development on water or air
pollution, soil erosion, and rare or irreplaceable natural
resources.
D. Any recommendations for variances or exceptions by the Plan
Commission must be approved by a majority vote of the Plan
Commission and shall be so endorsed by the Secretary and transmitted

to the Village Board. The Village Board, if it approves, shall do so by
resolution adopted by majority vote and shall instruct the Village Clerk-
Treasurer to notify the Plan Commission and the subdivider.
E. Variances from the strict application of this chapter may also be
granted in accordance with this chapter in the case of planned
developments, provided that the Village Board, upon review and
recommendations from the Plan Commission, shall find that the
proposed development is fully consistent with the purpose and intent of
this chapter, Chapter 510, Zoning, and the Comprehensive Plan.
A. Violations. It shall be unlawful to build upon, divide, convey, record, or

institute appropriate action or proceedings to enjoin violations of this
chapter or the applicable Wisconsin Statutes.

(a) Whenever the Village Engineer shall find at any time that
applicable ordinances, laws, orders, plans, and specifications

contractor has refused to conform after written warning or
instruction has been issued to him/her.
(b) Whenever the continuance of any construction becomes
dangerous to life or property.
(c) Whenever there is any violation of any condition or provision of
the application for permit, or of the permit or of any approval.
(d) Whenever, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, Director of
Public Works or Building Inspector, the subdivider has
provided inadequate management of the project.
(e) Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been
made in the application for permit, plans, drawings, data
specifications or certified lot or plot plan on which the issuance
of the permit or approval was based.
(f) Whenever there is a violation of any of the conditions of an
approval or occupancy permit given by the Village Engineer,
Director of Public Works or Building Inspector for the use of all

premises and his/her agent, if any, and/or on the person having
charge of construction.
(3) A revocation placard shall also be posted upon the premises in
question by the Village Engineer, Director of Public Works, or
Building Inspector.
(4) After the notice is served upon the person as aforesaid and posted,
it shall be unlawful for any person to proceed thereafter with any
construction operation whatsoever on the premises, and the permit
which has been so revoked shall be null and void, and before any
construction or operation is again resumed, a new permit, as
required by this chapter, shall be procured and fees paid therefor,
and thereafter the resumption of any construction or operation
shall be in compliance with the regulation of this chapter. However,
such work as the Village Engineer, Director of Public Works or
Building Inspector may order as a condition precedent to the
reissuance of the building permit may be performed, or such work
as he/she may require for the preservation of life and safety.286

§ 495-59. Disclaimer on approvals.
§ 495-60. Restrictions for public benefit.
Pursuant to § 236.293, Wis. Stats., any restriction placed on platted lands by
covenant, grant of easement, land division, certified survey or consolidation
approval which was required by the Village and which names a public body
or public utility as grantee, promisee or beneficiary vests in the public
body or utility the right to enforce the restriction by law or in equity
against anyone who has interest in the land subject to the restriction. The
restriction may be released or waived by resolution of the Village Board.
(5) Any appeals of such revocations or suspensions must be made in
writing and within seven calendar days to the Village Clerk-

therefrom, as provided in § 236.13(5), Wis. Stats., within 30 days of
notification of the rejection of the plat or certified survey. Where failure
to approve is based on an unsatisfied objection, the agency making the
objection shall be made a party to the action. The court may direct that
the plat or certified survey be approved if it finds that the action of the
approving or objecting agency is arbitrary, unreasonable or
discriminatory.
A. The purpose of requiring approvals under this chapter is to ensure the
health, safety, morale, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the
Village of East Troy. This chapter shall not be interpreted as placing any
responsibility or liability on any Village official, Village employee, or the
Village as a municipal corporation for the granting of approval or the
denial of any approval. All approvals rendered as part of this chapter
shall be considered as being approved conditionally based upon the
information and circumstances apparent at that time.
B. Approvals issued by the Village shall not be construed as an assumption
or expression of any responsibility, warranty or guarantee for the
design or construction of any improvements within the land division.

ARTICLE I
Introduction and Definitions
§ 510-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the "Village of East
Troy Zoning Ordinance," except where as referred to herein, where it shall
be known as "this chapter."
§ 510-2. Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the State
of Wisconsin Statutes. Specific statutory references are provided within
the body of this chapter solely as a means of assisting the reader. Such
references are not to be considered as all inclusive and shall in no manner
be construed so as to limit the application or interpretation of this chapter.
State law references: §§ 62.23(7), 62.231, and 87.30, Wis. Stats.
§ 510-3. Purpose and intent.
This chapter is adopted for the purpose of protecting the health, safety,
morals, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the public. This
chapter is designed to control and lessen congestion in the streets; to
secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote adequate light
and air; to protect groundwater resources; to prevent the overcrowding
of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to preserve, protect,
and promote property values; to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public facilities;
and to preserve burial sites as defined in § 157.70(1)(b), Wis. Stats. It is also
the intent of this chapter to implement certain goals and objectives of the
Village of East Troy Comprehensive Plan which are best addressed through
zoning approaches, as enabled by Wisconsin Statutes.
§ 510-4. Severability and nonliability.
A. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Village of East Troy
Village Board that the provisions of this chapter are separable in
accordance with the following:
(1) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of
this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other
provisions of this chapter not specifically included in said
judgment.
(2) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any portion of this chapter to a particular property,
water, building, or structure, such judgment shall not affect the
application of said provision to any other property, water, building,
or structure not specifically included in said judgment.
§ 510-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-4
1:701
§ 510-5. Abrogation.
It is not intended that this chapter abrogate or interfere with any
constitutionally protected vested right. It is also not intended that this
chapter abrogate, repeal, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing
easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations, or
permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law.
§ 510-6. Rules of interpretation.
(3) If any requirement or limitation attached to an authorization given
under this chapter is found invalid, it shall be presumed that the
authorization would not have been granted without the
requirement or limitation and, therefore, said authorization shall
also be invalid.
B. The Village does not guarantee, warrant, or represent that only those
areas designated as floodplain will be subject to periodic inundation
and hereby asserts that there is no liability on the part of the Village, its
officers, employees, agents, or representatives for any flood damages,
sanitation problems, or structural damages.
A. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, and welfare and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the Village and shall not be construed to be a
limitation or repeal of any other power now possessed by the Village of
East Troy.
B. Where property is affected by the regulations imposed by any provision
of this chapter and by other governmental regulations, the regulations
which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or
requirements shall prevail. Regardless of any other provision of this
chapter, no land shall be developed or used, and no structure erected or
maintained, in violation of any state or federal regulations. Where there
are conflicts between or among regulations within this chapter, the
regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher
standards or requirements shall prevail. In all instances where there
are conflicts between the text of this chapter and any tables or figures
of this chapter, the text shall prevail.
C. No structure, land, water, or air shall hereafter be used and no
structure or part thereof shall hereafter be located, erected, moved,
reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted, or structurally altered
without a building permit, except structures not requiring a building
permit (e.g., swing set, clothesline, etc.), and without full compliance
with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable local, county,
and state regulations.
D. Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in plans,
construction, size, or designated use of any building or part thereof for

§ 510-7. Jurisdiction.
This chapter is applicable to all territory located within the corporate limits
of the Village of East Troy.
§ 510-8. Reenactment and repeal.
§ 510-9. When effective.
This chapter shall become effective upon passage and posting according
to law, following the date of repeal and reenactment of the Official Zoning
Map. All plans approved under previous zoning regulations shall be valid
and may be used to obtain permits for a period of not more than one year
which a building permit has been issued before the effective date of this
chapter and the construction of which shall have been started within
one year from the date of such permit.
E. Except as provided in this chapter, under provisions for nonconforming
uses, nonconforming developments, nonconforming lots, and
nonconforming structures and buildings (see Article IX), no building,
structure, development, or premises shall be hereinafter used or
occupied, and no applicable permit granted, that does not conform to
the requirements of this chapter. In cases of mixed occupancy or mixed
use, the regulations for each land use shall apply to the portion of the
structure or land so occupied or so used.287
F. Except for outlots authorized under Chapter 495, Subdivision of Land,
of the Village Code to contain permanently protected green space area,
no yard or other open space area shall be considered as providing a
yard or open space for a building or structure on any other lot.
A. This chapter, in part, carries forward by reenactment some of the
provisions of the regulations governing zoning and related matters
previously known collectively as the "Zoning Code," Title 13 of the Code
of Ordinances for the Village of East Troy, adopted prior to the effective
date of this chapter. It is not the intention of this chapter to repeal but
rather to reenact and continue in force such existing provisions so that
all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are preserved
and may be enforced, unless explicitly surrendered by specific
provisions of this chapter or altered by the Official Zoning Map.
B. All provisions of Title 13 of the Village of East Troy Code of Ordinances
which are not reenacted herein are hereby repealed.
C. The adoption of this chapter shall not adversely affect the Village's right
to prosecute any violation of the predecessor Zoning Code, provided
that the violation occurred while that chapter was in effect.

ARTICLE VI
Land Use Regulations
§ 510-34. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to indicate which land uses may locate in each
zoning district and under what requirements and which land uses may not
locate therein. Certain land uses may locate in a given district as a matter
of right upon compliance with special regulations for such a land use. A
further distinction is made for land uses which may locate in a given district
only upon obtaining a conditional use or temporary use permit.
§ 510-35. Regulation of allowable uses.
The allowable land uses for each zoning district are established in Articles
III, IV and V of this chapter. Detailed descriptions and regulations for uses
are found in §§ 510-37 through 510-48. Even if a land use may be indicated
as permitted by right or requiring a conditional use in a particular district,
such a land use may not necessarily be permitted or permissible on any or
every property in such district. No land use is permitted or permissible on
a property unless it can be located on it or implemented in full compliance
with all of the applicable standards and regulations of this chapter or unless
an appropriate variance has been granted pursuant to § 510-161.
A. Principal land uses permitted by right. Principal land uses listed as
permitted by right (designated by the letter "P" in the Table of Land
Uses; see § 510-38) are permitted per the general land use
requirements of this article; per the density, intensity, and bulk
regulations of the specific zoning district in which they are located; per
any additional requirements imposed by applicable overlay districts;
per all other applicable requirements of this chapter; and per any and
all other applicable Village, county, state, and federal regulations.
B. Principal land uses permitted as conditional uses. Principal land uses
allowed only with a conditional use permit (designated by the letter "C"
in the Table of Land Uses; see § 510-38) may be permitted subject to all
the requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in
Subsection A above, plus any additional requirements applicable to that
particular land use imposed as part of the conditional use permit
process established in § 510-157. Each application for, and instance of,
a conditional use shall be considered a unique situation and shall not be
construed as precedence for similar requests. Except for uses approved
under a general development plan and final development plan in a
planned development (see § 510-75 and Article XII), all uses requiring a
conditional use permit shall comply with the procedural requirements
of Article XVII.
C. Accessory land uses. Accessory land uses are allowed subject to all the
requirements and exemptions applicable to principal land uses
permitted by right as listed in Subsection A above. Accessory land uses
allowed only with a conditional use permit are subject to all the

regulations which land uses shall adhere to and which are directly
related to the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the
residents of the Village of East Troy.

of land shall comply with all the regulations and requirements of this
chapter pertaining to the protection of sensitive natural resources and
open space areas, protection of community character, and the
protection from airport operations as established under any applicable
overlay zoning districts in Article X of this chapter.

expanded residential and nonresidential development shall comply with
all applicable building and site design guidelines as required in
§ 510-90 of this chapter.

address issues such as minimum required landscaping of developed
land and minimum required provision of bufferyards between adjoining
zoning districts, which are directly related to the effective bulk of a
structure.
G. Signage regulations. All land use and/or development of land shall
comply with all requirements of Article XV pertaining to the type and
amount of signage permitted on property. Such requirements address
issues such as the maximum area of permitted signage and the number
and types of permitted signage.
H. Number of buildings per lot. In the RH-35, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7,

lot upon granting of a conditional use permit for group development
(Subsection J) or large development regulations in compliance
(Subsection K).
I. Number of land uses per building. No more than one nonresidential
land use shall be permitted in any building unless a conditional use
permit for a group development (Subsection J) or large development
(Subsection K) is obtained. With the exception of accessory dwelling
units, home occupation, expanded home occupation, and in-family suite

ARTICLE VII
Density and Intensity
§ 510-49. Purpose.
This article regulates the development potential of all property within the
jurisdiction of this chapter in order to protect and enhance the desired
community character of the Village of East Troy. The purpose of this article
is to indicate the maximum permitted density (for residential projects) and
maximum permitted intensity (for nonresidential projects) of development
on any given site within the jurisdiction of this chapter. This article is
designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of
the Village of East Troy Comprehensive Plan. Many of these are extremely
difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques, particularly those
which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum
permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish
the character of nonresidential developments. Such approaches provide for
a minimum flexibility and/or the needless destruction of sensitive natural
resources. Any nonconforming situation (lot, use, structure and/or site)
shall adhere to the provisions of Article IX.
§ 510-50. Approach.
§ 510-51. Natural resources site evaluation.
A. The approach employed by this article considers both the development
potential of a given lot as well as the natural resources requiring
protection and preservation located on the site and applies the
following methods to ensure a high degree of site design flexibility and
the protection of community character and natural resources:
(1) Maximum gross densities (MGD).
(2) Minimum green space ratios (GSR).
(3) Minimum landscape surface ratios (LSR).
(4) Floor area ratios (FAR).
B. The development potential of any site is determined by a variety of
factors, including but not limited to:
(1) Area of the site.
(2) Proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources.
(3) Zoning district(s) in which the site is located.
(4) Development option(s) the site is developed under.
(5) Use(s) considered for development.
§ 510-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-51
1:835
§ 510-52. Instructions to determine density and intensity.
This article, in conjunction with the density and intensity regulations
included in Articles III, IV and V, contains the standards which determine
the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site. This
article recognizes inherent differences between residential and
nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly
different manners.
A. Purpose. An important goal of the Village of East Troy is to protect
natural resources that are sensitive to disruption caused by
development and/or other land use activities. These resources include
floodways, floodplain areas, flood-fringe, shorelands, wetlands,
lakeshores, steep slopes, and woodlands. These resources serve
important functions which are lost in the absence of correct mitigation
approaches when these areas are subject to development and/or other
land use activities. In many instances, these functions cannot be
provided by other natural or man-made features. Specific broad
categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of
air, surface water, groundwater, and soil quality; habitat provisions and
diversification; aesthetic diversification; and buffering effects.
B. Natural Resources Site Evaluation Worksheet. This worksheet is
intended to determine which areas of a site are considered natural
areas, requiring protection and preservation, and which areas are most
suited for development.327
A. Instructions to determine density and intensity are applicable to both
residential and nonresidential development.
(1) The Village's Comprehensive Plan should be reviewed for
implications related to the subject property, particularly the Future
Land Use and Transportation Maps.
(2) The Village's Official Map should be reviewed for planned capital
facilities and dedication requirements, including schools, parks,
stormwater management facilities, and street improvements,
which may affect the subject property.
(3) The amount and type of development any given site may contain is
directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located.
The current zoning designation as depicted on the Official Zoning
Map should be compared with the description of that district
provided in Article II.
(4) The effect of protected natural resources on the development
potential of the subject property should be evaluated. A Natural
Resources Site Evaluation Worksheet (see § 510-51B above) should
be completed for the site. All resources listed should be identified
327. Editor's Note: The Natural Resources Site Evaluation Worksheet is included as an
attachment to this chapter.
§ 510-51 EAST TROY CODE § 510-52
1:836
on the subject property, and the total area of the property (in acres)
covered by those resources [resource protection areas (RPA)]
should be determined, as should the gross site area (GSA) and the
net developable area (NDA) of the subject property.
B. The following instructions apply only to residential development. In
addition to Subsection A(1) through (4) above, the following steps shall
be completed to determine residential density:
(1) Determine the types of dwelling units permitted on the subject
property by checking the zoning district in Articles III, IV and V.
Article VI provides detailed descriptions and regulations for each
dwelling unit (land use) type.
(2) Check the minimum site area (MSA) requirement against the gross
site area (GSA) of the subject property (refer to Articles III, IV and
V), as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in
Subsection A(4) above. If the GSA is less than the MSA required by
the selected development option, then a different development
option must be selected or additional property should be acquired.
(3) Determine the maximum gross density permitted on the site. The
maximum gross density, per the zoning district of the subject
property (see Articles II, III, IV and V), should be noted and used in
Subsection B(4) below.
(4) Determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site. The
maximum gross density, identified in Subsection B(3) above,
multiplied by the gross site area calculated in Subsection B(2)
above, equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on
the subject property under the selected development option within
the zoning district of the subject property. The ability to actually
develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not
guaranteed by the provisions of this article. Inefficient site design,
poor property configuration, and other factors may result in a lower
number of units actually fitting on the site.
(5) Check the minimum lot area (MLA) requirement of the subject
property (refer to Articles III, IV and V). The MLA must be equal to
or less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit
proposed for the project in Subsection B(1) above. If the MLA given
in the zoning district is larger than the lot size requirement given in
Subsection B(1), then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size
must be selected [in which case, it may be advantageous to repeat
Subsection B(1) through (5) using a different dwelling unit type].
C. The following instructions apply only to nonresidential development. In
addition to Subsection A(1) through (4) above, the following steps shall
be completed to determine nonresidential intensity:
(1) Determine the types of land uses permitted on the subject property
by checking the zoning district in Articles III, IV and V. Article VII
§ 510-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-52
1:837
provides detailed descriptions and regulations for each land use
type.
(2) Check the minimum lot area requirement against the gross site
area present on the subject property as determined under the
natural resources site evaluation in Subsection A(4) above. If the
GSA is less than the MLA required by the zoning district, then
additional property should be acquired. In other words, the GSA
must be greater than or equal to the MLA.
(3) Check the minimum landscape surface ratio (LSR) requirement
(refer to Articles III, IV and V) against the required resource
protection area (RPA) present on the subject property. The LSR
should be multiplied by the GSA used in Subsection C(2) above. The
resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently
protected as green space. This area should be compared with the
required RPA on the subject property as determined under the
natural resource site evaluation in Subsection A(4) above. If the
area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the
area of permanently protected landscape surface required, then
more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum
development potential on the site. In other words, if the RPA is
greater than the LSR, the use of more floors may permit the
development of more floor area on the subject property.
(4) Determine the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) permitted on the
site, which is calculated by dividing the total floor area of all
buildings on a site by the gross site area (see "maximum floor area
ratio"). This number will be used in Subsection C(5) below.
(5) Determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site. The
maximum floor area ratio (FAR), identified in Subsection C(4)
above, multiplied by the gross site area (GSA) calculated in
Subsection C(2) above, equals the maximum square footage of
gross floor area permitted on the subject property within that
zoning district. The ability to actually develop this amount of floor
area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this article. Inefficient
site design, poor property configuration, and other factors may
result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site.
(6) Check the maximum building size (MBS) requirement indicated in
Articles III, IV and V. If the MBS given in Articles III, IV and V is
smaller than the proposed building size calculated in Subsection
C(5) above, then a smaller building must be built or the use of
additional buildings should be considered.

ARTICLE VIII
Bulk Regulations
§ 510-53. Purpose.
This article regulates the location and bulk of buildings in both residential
and nonresidential developments in order to protect and enhance the
desired community character of the Village of East Troy. The provisions
of this article interact closely with the density and intensity provisions
described in Article VII. Any nonconforming situation (lot, use, structure
and/or site) shall adhere to the provisions of Article IX.
§ 510-54. Residential bulk standards.
All residential lots shall comply with the standards prescribed by this
section, § 510-39, and the bulk requirements listed for each residential
zoning district in Articles II, III, IV and V.328
§ 510-55. Nonresidential bulk standards.
All nonresidential lots created under the provisions of this chapter shall
comply with the standards of this section and the bulk requirements related
to the specific zoning district used as listed in Articles III, IV and V.329
§ 510-56. Yard setback adjustments.
Front yard setbacks should be adjusted as follows when the described
conditions or circumstances exist:
A. Limitations on yard setback adjustments.
(1) No yard shall be reduced in area or dimension so as to make such
yard less than the minimum required by this chapter. If an existing
yard is less than the minimum required, it shall not be reduced
further, except where exempted by the provisions of this section.
(2) No required yard or lot area allocated to satisfy the minimum yard
or lot area requirements for one building or structure shall be used
to satisfy the minimum yard or lot area requirement for another
building or structure.
B. Side and rear yard adjustments for bufferyards. In instances where the
required bufferyard width (per Article XIV) exceeds the minimum
required setback width, the minimum required bufferyard width shall
prevail. Absolutely no intrusions of a building or structure are
permitted within the required bufferyard.
C. Street side (front yard) setback adjustments.
328. Editor's Note: Figure 510-54: Residential Bulk Regulations, is included as an attachment
to this chapter.

§ 510-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-56
1:839
§ 510-57. Intrusions into required yards.
The minimum setback requirements of each zoning district establish the
minimum required yards for all uses, except those exempted by the
provisions of this section.
(1) For lots located adjacent to a street with an officially mapped or
existing right-of-way equal to or exceeding 100 feet, a forty-foot
setback is required to address anticipated future conditions of
noise and air quality.
(2) The required street side (front yard) setback for any use may be
reduced for a principal structure on any lot where more than 50%
of the same type of principal structure on the same block or same
street does not meet the required front yard setback. In such
instances, the required front yard setback for the proposed
structure shall be the average of all the adjoining same type
principal structures on said block or street.
(3) In order to preserve and maintain the character of established
neighborhoods that are typified by front yard setbacks
substantially in excess of the minimum required front yard setback,
the following shall apply: blocks with an average street side (front
yard) setback more than five feet over the minimum required front
yard setback shall be increased to the average of the adjoining
same type of principal structures on said block or street.
A. Permitted intrusions into required street side yard:
(1) Chimneys, flues, sills, pilasters, lintels, ornamental features,
cornices, eaves, and gutters for residential buildings, provided that
they do not extend more than 2 1/2 feet into the required yard.
(2) Yard lights, ornamental lights, and nameplate signs for residential
lots, provided that they comply with the illumination requirements
of § 510-95 and provided that they do not locate closer than five
feet to the front or street property line.
(3) Terraces, steps, uncovered porches, decks, stoops, or similar
appurtenances to residential buildings which do not extend above
the floor level of the adjacent building entrance, provided that they
do not locate closer than 20 feet to any street right-of-way.
(4) Fences on residential or nonresidential lots which do not exceed
four feet in height, provided that they do not locate closer than six
inches to any street right-of-way. Permitted fence types shall
comply with the provisions of § 510-97.
B. Permitted intrusions into required side yards.

The following structures are allowed in all yard setback areas, but not closer
than three feet to an abutting property boundary line:
§ 510-58. Exceptions to maximum height regulations.
The maximum height regulations listed for residential and nonresidential
uses and accessory structures in each zoning district in Articles III, IV and V
are the maximum permitted heights for all buildings and structures, except
those exempted by this section.
(1) Sills, pilasters, lintels, ornamental features, cornices, eaves, and
gutters for residential buildings, provided that they do not extend
more than 2 1/2 feet into the required yard.
(2) Fences may locate on the property line. Permitted fence types shall
comply with the provisions of § 510-97.
(3) Fire escapes (on residential buildings) which do not extend more

grade, provided that they do not locate closer than 20 feet to the rear
lot line.
D. All street side (front yard) setback areas. With the exception of fences,
no accessory structures shall be permitted within any portion of a street
yard (front yard), except where there is a shore yard. In instances
where there is a shore yard, shore yards shall be treated as front yards
and street yards as rear yards, whereby accessory structures may be
located between a principal building and a street frontage on the same
lot.
A. Garden pools, fountains, and statuary.
B. Flagpoles on residential properties, not exceeding 24 feet in height
above the ground surface. The area around the flagpole may not be
mounded or built up in any manner to increase the overall height of the
flagpole above the surrounding grade.
C. Flagpoles on commercial, industrial, and institutional properties, not
exceeding 32 feet in height above the ground surface, as depicted on an
approved site plan. The area around the flagpole may not be mounded
or built up in any manner to increase the overall height of the flagpole
above the surrounding grade.

height: chimneys, smokestacks, cooling towers, and elevator
penthouses.
C. Any building or structure not otherwise accounted for by Subsections A
and B above may exceed said maximum height regulations with the
granting of a conditional use permit which specifically states the
maximum permitted height of the proposed building or structure.
A. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
CANOPY and AWNING  A permanent structure without walls for the
purpose of shielding driveways, sidewalks, or service areas from the
elements. Canopies are composed of solid materials such as metal and/
or wood. Awnings may have a metal or wood frame but typically have
surfaces composed of canvas, vinyl or similar flexible material.
B. Districts permitted. Canopies and awnings are permitted in all zoning
districts.
C. Regulations.
(1) Plan Commission approval required. All canopies and awnings shall

ARTICLE IX
Nonconforming Situations
§ 510-60. Purpose. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02]
The purpose of this article is to establish regulations for nonconforming
uses, nonconforming lots, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming
sites created legally prior to July 18, 2011, the effective date of this chapter.
Nonconforming signs are addressed in Article XV.
§ 510-61. Nonconforming uses. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No.
2015-02; 5-20-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-04]
A. Continuance of a nonconforming use.
(1) Any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of
this chapter, or any amendment to it, may be continued at the size
and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as
specified in this section.
(2) A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a
legal land use, either permitted by right or as a conditional use,
prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be considered a
legal, conforming land use so long as any previously approved
conditions of use and site plan are followed. Any modification of the
previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall require
application and Village consideration under the requirements of
§ 510-160.
(3) Any prior legal use made nonconforming by a modification to the
Official Zoning Map after the effective date of this chapter may be
granted legal conforming use status by changing the zoning district
of the affected property to an appropriate district through an
amendment to the Official Zoning Map. Such requested
amendment shall be subject to the standards and procedures
prescribed by § 510-155.
B. Modification of a nonconforming use.
(1) Except as permitted in Subsection B(3) below, a nonconforming use
shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, or reconstructed,
unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which
the use is located.
(2) Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the Plan
Commission.
(3) A nonconforming nonresidential use not served by public sanitary
sewer and/or public water may be permitted to expand without
being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if either
or both facilities are not available within 1,000 feet of the subject
property.

1:845
§ 510-62. Nonconforming lots. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No.
2015-02]
C. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. When any nonconforming use
of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive
months, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use of said
structure or land shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of
this chapter.
D. Maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use. The ordinary
maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use is permitted, including
necessary repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate
the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose
of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever
a nonconforming use is damaged to the extent of more than 50% of its
current equalized assessed value, it shall not be restored except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the structural repairs or
alterations in a structure either itself nonconforming or containing a
nonconforming use shall not during its lifetime exceed 50% of the
present equalized assessed value of said structure unless permanently
changed to a conforming use.
A. Blanket conforming status. Blanket conforming status for any and all
requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to all
nonconforming lots in their configuration existing or as finally approved
as of the effective date of this chapter. However, after the effective date
of this chapter, no lot shall be created which does not meet the
dimensional (density, intensity and bulk) requirements of each zoning
district, per Articles III, IV and V. This subsection ensures that lots
approved and created prior to the adoption of this chapter do not
encounter difficulty because the lots would otherwise be considered
nonconforming.
B. A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this chapter in a
residential zoning district, which does not meet the minimum lot
dimensional requirements for the zoning district, may be utilized for a
detached single-family dwelling unit, provided that the measurements
of such area and dimensions are equal to or greater than 80% of the
minimum requirements of the SR-4 Zoning District. Said lot shall not be
more intensively developed (with nonresidential uses) unless combined
with one or more abutting lots (or portions thereof) so as to create a lot
which meets the requirements of this chapter.
C. A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this chapter in the
RH-35 Zoning District which is less than 35 acres in area and which has
no dwelling units (neither farm residence or single-family residence)
may be utilized, or one detached single-family dwelling unit may be
constructed, provided that the measurements of such area and
dimensions are equal to or greater than 80% of the minimum

No. 2015-02]
requirements of the RH-35 Zoning District and adequate access to a
public right-of-way is provided.
A. Blanket conforming status. Blanket conforming status for any and all
requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to any
structure lawfully existing upon the effective date of this chapter. After
the effective date of this chapter, structures may not be enlarged,
expanded, or extended without bringing the enlargement, expansion, or
extension into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or unless
a variance is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals under § 510-161.
(1) This subsection is intended to eliminate the continued classification
and/or creation of structures as nonconforming subject to the
requirements of this chapter.
(a) This provision addresses two different situations:
[1] Any structure in the community erected prior to the
adoption of zoning that does not meet some or all of the
bulk requirements of this chapter.
[2] In some instances, this chapter establishes new bulk or
intensity requirements that existing legal structures under
the previous zoning ordinance do not meet.
(b) This subsection therefore ensures that owners of such
structures legally established prior to the adoption of this
chapter do not encounter difficulty because the structures
would otherwise be considered nonconforming.
B. Restoration. A damaged, destroyed, or removed nonconforming
structure may be restored to the size, location, design and use that it
had immediately before the damage, destruction, or removal occurred
without any limits on the costs of the repair, reconstruction, or
improvement if Subsection B(1) through (3) below apply. The burden of
proof in regard to the location, dimensions, configuration, and exterior
building materials of the damaged or removed structure shall be upon
the property owner to demonstrate prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
(1) The nonconforming structure was damaged or destroyed on or
after the effective date of this chapter.
(2) The damage or destruction was caused by violent wind, vandalism,
fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or infestation.
(3) If removed, the structure was removed or partially removed with
the permission of the Village.
§ 510-62 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-63
1:847
§ 510-64. Nonconforming sites.331
C. Unsafe structures. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the Building
Inspector or any other Village official from initiating remedial or
enforcement actions when a lawful nonconforming structure is
declared unsafe or presents a danger to the public health, safety, or
welfare.
D. Future modification. When any lawful nonconforming structure in any
district is modified so as to be in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter, any future modification of said structure shall be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
E. Ordinary maintenance. Ordinary maintenance repairs, including
repairs reasonably necessary to prevent the deterioration of a
structure, and remodeling of a nonconforming structure are permitted,
as well as necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not
extend, enlarge, or intensify the nonconforming structure. Ordinary
maintenance repairs and remodeling include internal and external
painting, decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the
installation of heating, electricity, plumbing (including fixtures) or
insulation, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other
nonstructural components.
F. Alterations. Structural alterations may be made to a building containing
lawful nonconforming residential units, provided that such alterations
do not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a conforming garage may be added if
none previously existed. However, after the effective date of this
chapter, such buildings shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended
without bringing the enlargement, expansion or extension into
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, unless a variance is
granted under § 510-161 and except as permitted under this section.
G. Timing of building permit. Any structure for which a building permit
has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this chapter, or
an amendment to it, which will become nonconforming under the
provisions of this chapter, or that amendment thereto, may be
completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided that
construction is started within 365 calendar days after issuance of the
permit for single- and two-family construction and within 365 calendar
days after issuance of a permit for all other development and
construction is completed within 730 calendar days (two years) after
the start of construction. If all such conditions are met, the structure
shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure.
A. Blanket conforming status. Blanket conforming status for any and all
requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to all
331. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 510-63 EAST TROY CODE § 510-64
1:848
development sites in their configuration existing or as finally approved
as of the effective date of this chapter. However, after the effective
date of this chapter, additional site development that would result in
the enlargement, expansion, or extension of uses or structures will
not be allowed to occur without bringing the enlargement into full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or to the extent practical
without removal of lawful structures in accordance with the following
Subsections C through E below.
(1) This subsection is intended to prevent the creation of certain
nonconforming sites related to building and site design subject to
the requirements of this chapter. These building and site design
components may include one or more of the following:
(a) Build-to design requirements.
(b) Exterior building materials requirements.
(c) Exterior building design requirements.
(d) Parking, loading, access drive and other paved area design
requirements.
(e) Landscaping design requirements.
(f) Bufferyard design requirements.
(g) Fencing design requirements.
(h) Lighting design requirements.
(2) This subsection ensures that sites approved prior to the adoption of
this chapter do not encounter difficulty because they would
otherwise be considered nonconforming.
B. On lots where the site configuration and undeveloped area are
sufficient to comply with nonconformities in site design, no
enlargement, expansion, or extension of a use or structure shall be
permitted if it makes compliance with site regulations of this chapter
impossible, even if said enlargement, expansion, or extension of the use
or structure would otherwise be permissible.
C. Enlargements, expansions, or extensions that would result in creation
of one or more nonconformities, render a nonconforming site incapable
of being brought into full or greater compliance with nonconforming
site requirements, or increase the degree of existing nonconformities
with the site development standards of this chapter shall not be
permitted, unless a variance is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
under § 510-161.
D. On lots with adequate configuration and area to bring the site into full
or greater compliance with site design standards, said compliance shall
be required at the time of any property improvement, modification,
§ 510-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-64
1:849
enlargement, or expansion requiring site plan review by the Plan
Commission. The degree to which the property shall be made to comply
with substandard site design elements shall be proportional to the
degree of property improvement per the following:
(1) Total additions or expansions to structures on nonconforming sites
shall require correction of existing nonconformities of on-site
improvements in accordance with the following:
(a) Renovations that do not result in expansions of the total gross
square footage of the existing structure(s) and/or outdoor
storage areas less than 50% of the existing structural and/or
outdoor storage area within any continuous five-year period
shall require a corresponding percentage increase in
compliance with the site improvements required by this
chapter until the site achieves 100% compliance. (Example: A
property with a permitted, expandable use currently has only
50% of the required landscaping. An addition to the structure
equaling 20% of the combined area of the existing structures
and outdoor operations/storage uses on a site is proposed.
Therefore, as a condition of approval, an additional 20% of
landscaping required for the whole site must be added. In this
instance, 70% of the landscaping requirement would be met
upon completion of the improvements.)
(b) Complete replacement of existing structures or expansions of
the existing structures that result in a total of 50% or greater
increase of total gross square footage within any continuous
five-year period require the entire property to meet all of the
site improvement requirements of this chapter. The same
requirements also apply to increased or new outdoor areas
used for outdoor operations/storage.
E. On lots where the configuration and undeveloped area of the
nonconforming site provide insufficient space to bring the site into full
compliance with all site requirements but nevertheless provide space to
reduce the degree of one or more nonconformities, the Plan
Commission shall make a determination as to the manner and degree to
which each site nonconformity shall be brought into conformance.

ARTICLE X
Overlay Zoning Districts
§ 510-65. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish overlay zoning districts wherein
certain additional requirements are superimposed on the underlying
standard zoning districts set forth in Articles II, III, IV and V of this chapter.
Each overlay district is intended to address a special land use circumstance
beyond those addressed by the underlying zoning district. Special
requirements include mandatory protections against natural hazards,
mandatory protections of valued natural resources, special design
guidelines, and measures to ensure compatibility with airport flight
operations. Each overlay district is intended to implement one or more
aspects of the Comprehensive Plan and to ensure compliance with federal
and state requirements. Any nonconforming situation (lot, use, structure
and/or site) shall adhere to the provisions of Article IX.
§ 510-66. Interpretation.
A given property may lie within one or more overlay zoning districts based
on its geographic location. The provisions of this article are intended to
be consulted before issuance of any building permit, site plan approval,
conditional use permit, zoning permit, zoning change, or land division to
ensure the intended use meets all of the requirements of any applicable
overlay district, in addition to the underlying standard zoning district (see
Articles II, III, IV and V). For each overlay district established in this article,
a definition of the resource or geographic area is provided, followed by
the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing the resource
or geographic location, the method of delineating the boundaries of the
overlay district, and the mandatory development regulations.
§ 510-67. Overlay zoning districts. [Amended 7-21-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-07]
For the purpose of this chapter, the overlay zoning districts listed below are
hereby established:
AHR Airport Height Restriction
FP Floodplain
S Shoreland
SW Shoreland-Wetland
GP Groundwater Protection
NFC Natural Features Conservancy
DD Downtown Design

§ 510-68. Official Overlay Zoning Map. [Amended 12-16-2019 by
Ord. No. 2019-18]
Except where otherwise indicated in this article, the overlay zoning districts
are represented on the Official Overlay Zoning Map adopted and from time
to time amended by the Village of East Troy.332
§ 510-69. Airport Height Restriction Overlay District.
A. Purpose. This district is intended to regulate the height of buildings,
structures, and fixtures within the vicinity of the East Troy Municipal
Airport to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of both airport
users and residents of the surrounding communities. Regulations of the
AHR District apply to all properties within the AHR District regardless
of ownership. The AHR District is intended to prevent or more closely
regulate buildings, structures, and fixtures to ensure safe landing,
takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft within the vicinity of the airport.
B. Height regulations. The following regulations shall apply to the Airport
Height Restriction District:
(1) The determination of the overall height of a building, structure, or
fixture within the AHR District shall include any appurtenance
installed thereon (see also "building height" under § 510-12).
(2) Height limitation zones. Except as otherwise provided in this
article, no structure shall be constructed, altered, or located or
permitted to remain after such construction, alteration, or location
at a height in excess of the height limitation indicated on the
Height Limitation Zoning Map, East Troy Municipal Airport,
Walworth County, Wisconsin, dated November 17, 1988, which is
hereby adopted and made part of this chapter.
(3) All lighting fixtures within the AHR District, including building and
pole-mounted, shall be full cutoff fixtures and shall not exceed 12
feet in height.
(4) Trees, shrubs, bushes, and other plants shall not exceed 20 feet in
height. The Zoning Administrator and/or Building Inspector shall
have the right to trim, prune, or remove, at the owner's expense,
any plant which was planted after adoption of this chapter and
found to be in violation of the height restriction for the zone in
which it is located.
(5) Exemptions from height regulations. The restrictions contained in
Subsection B(2) above shall not apply to objects which are less than
35 feet in height above ground level at the object site within 1/2
mile of the airport boundary or to structures less than 50 feet in
height above the ground within the area beginning 1/2 mile from
332. Editor's Note: The Official Overlay Zoning Map is on file at the office of the Village Clerk.

§ 510-70. Shoreland Overlay District. [Added 7-21-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-07]
the airport boundary extending to three miles from the airport
boundary.
C. Nonconforming buildings, structures and fixtures.
(1) The regulations prescribed in Subsection B above shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or
alterations of any nonconforming buildings, structures, fixtures, or
uses or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any such
nonconformity, except as provided in Subsection D below.
(2) Nothing herein contained shall require any change in construction,
alteration, or intended use of any structure, if the construction or
alteration of such was begun prior to September 3, 1996, and if
such is diligently prosecuted. This section shall not interfere with
the removal of nonconformities by purchase or the use of eminent
domain.
(3) Before nonconformities may be replaced, altered, or rebuilt, a
permit shall be applied for and secured in the manner prescribed
under Subsection D below authorizing such change, replacement,
or repair. No such permit shall be denied if the structure will not
become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the
effective date of this article or than it was when the application for
permit was made.
D. Permits. No structure that exceeds the height limitations indicated in
Subsection B shall be constructed, erected or installed, or be permitted
to remain, in any zone created by Subsection B until the applicant has
applied for and been granted a building permit. Said permit shall be
posted in a prominent place on the premises prior to and during the
construction period, erection, installation, or establishment.
Application for such permit shall indicate the use for which the permit
is desired and shall describe and locate the use with sufficient
particularity to permit the Zoning Administrator and/or Building
Inspector to determine whether such use would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the Zoning Administrator and/or Building Inspector shall
issue the permit applied for.333
A. Legislative findings. The Village Board makes the following legislative
findings relating to the Shoreland Overlay District:
333. Editor's Note: Original § 13-1-85, Floodplain Overlay District, which immediately followed
this section, was repealed 8-18-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-09. See now Art. XVIII, Floodplain
Overlay District.
§ 510-69 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-70
1:853
(1) Villages are required by § 61.353, Wis. Stats., to adopt shoreland
zoning regulations meeting the minimum standards set forth in
that section by July 1, 2014.
(2) Uncontrolled use of the shorelands and pollution of the navigable
waters of the municipality would adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare and impair the tax base.
B. Purpose. This section promotes the public health, safety, and welfare
and is intended to:
(1) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions and
prevent and control water pollution.
(2) Protect spawning grounds, fish, and aquatic life by controlling the
removal of shoreline vegetation.
(3) Control the placement of principal buildings by establishing
setbacks from waterways.
(4) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by:
(a) Restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover;
(b) Preventing shoreline encroachment by structures;
(c) Controlling shoreland excavation and other earthmoving
activities; and
(d) Regulating the use and placement of boathouses and other
structures.
C. Boundary of district. The Shoreland Overlay District includes land
located within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of a navigable
lake, pond, or flowage or within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water
mark of a navigable river or stream or to the landward side of the onehundred-
year floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Any feature
designated as a lake or as a stream on the Zoning Map has been
determined to be navigable for the purpose of this section. The Flood
Insurance Rate Maps adopted under § 510-167 of this chapter are used
in determining the extent of the one-hundred-year floodplain.
D. Vegetation management within shoreline buffer zone. Woody vegetation
not located in a wetland and woody and nonwoody vegetation in a
wetland located in the shoreline buffer zone (i.e., 35 feet landward from
the ordinary high-water mark) shall not be removed, except as
described in this subsection. Vegetation listed by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources as an invasive species under Ch. NR
40, Wis. Adm. Code, may be removed, provided that the property owner
reestablishes vegetation within the shoreline buffer zone consistent
with a management plan approved by the Plan Commission. Vegetation
may be removed to create and maintain a viewing/access corridor no
more than 30 feet wide for every 100 feet of shoreline frontage.
§ 510-70 EAST TROY CODE § 510-70
1:854
E. Shoreline setback.
(1) Principal buildings shall be no closer than 50 feet to the ordinary
high-water mark, except that a lesser setback is allowed if all of the
following apply:
(a) The principal building is constructed or placed on a lot or
parcel of land that is immediately adjacent on each side to a lot
or parcel of land containing a principal building.
(b) The principal building is constructed or placed within a
distance equal to the average setback of the principal building
on the adjacent lots or 35 feet from the ordinary high-water
mark, whichever distance is greater.
(2) Accessory buildings shall comply with the setback standards for
principal buildings described in this subsection, except that a
boathouse may be constructed within 35 feet of the ordinary highwater
mark as set forth in Subsection F below.
Figure 510-70: Shoreline Setback Requirements (Sample
Graphic)
§ 510-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-70
1:855
Key:
Lot 1 The principal building is existing and is more than 50 feet
from the ordinary high-water mark (OHWM).
Lot 2 The lot is vacant. Because the lots on both sides have a
principal building, setback averaging may be used, but the
setback may not be less than 35 feet. In the instance
depicted above, the setback would be calculated as
follows: (50 feet plus the actual distance of the building on
Lot 3) divided by two.
Lot 3 The principal building is existing and is less than 50 feet
from the ordinary high-water mark.
Lot 4 The lot is vacant. A principal building on this lot must
comply with the fifty-foot setback requirement because
setback averaging does not apply (i.e., a principal building
is only on one side).
Lot 5 The lot is vacant.
F. Boathouses. A boathouse constructed within the Shoreland Overlay
District shall comply with each of the following requirements:
(1) The boathouse shall be located in the viewing/access corridor as
allowed in Subsection D above.
(2) The boathouse shall be designed and constructed solely for the
storage of watercraft and related equipment; human habitation is
strictly prohibited.
(3) One boathouse is permitted on a lot as an accessory structure.
(4) The boathouse shall not be constructed where the existing slope is
more than 20%.
(5) The boathouse shall not be closer than five feet to the ordinary
high-water mark of the stream or lake on which it fronts. A
boathouse shall not be closer than five feet to a side lot line.
(6) If the boathouse is located, in whole or in part, within the
Floodplain Overlay District, all applicable standards of that district
shall apply.
(7) The boathouse shall not exceed 12 feet in height at the roof peak
above the original grade or final grade as measured on the side
facing the water body.
(8) The floor area of the boathouse shall not exceed 450 square feet.
(9) The boathouse must have an appropriate door or double-wide doors
facing the water body for the purpose of entry and exit for
watercraft. French, patio, or glass doors are prohibited.
§ 510-70 EAST TROY CODE § 510-70
1:856
§ 510-71. Shoreland-Wetland Overlay District.
(10) The boathouse may contain plumbing for two sinks and one toilet,
provided that such fixtures are connected to an approved
wastewater system. Showers and/or bathtubs are prohibited.
A. Statutory authorization. This section is authorized pursuant to §§ 61.35,
61.351, 87.30 and 281.31, Wis. Stats.
B. Findings of fact. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the
pollution of the navigable waters of the Village of East Troy would
adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general
welfare and impair the tax base. The Wisconsin Legislature has
delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
(1) Promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general
welfare.
(2) Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of
wetlands.
(3) Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which
filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic
compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters.
(4) Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife
by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat.
(5) Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland areas.
(6) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland
excavation, filling, and other earthmoving activities.
C. Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within
the shoreland-wetland area of the Village of East Troy shall be in full
compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable local,
state, or federal regulations.
D. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with shoreland-wetland regulations and obtain all necessary
permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis.
Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and
repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation are exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
E. Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this section to
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing
easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules,
regulations, ordinances, or permits previously adopted or issued
pursuant to law. However, wherever this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this section shall govern.
§ 510-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-71
1:857
F. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Wisconsin
Statutes. Where a provision of this section is required by a standard in
Ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the provision in this section is
unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Chapter NR
117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this section or in
effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this section.
G. Shoreland-wetland zoning maps. The following are hereby adopted and
made part of this section and are on file with the Zoning Administrator:
Wisconsin wetland inventory map stamped "Final" on July 7, 1987 (and
any amendments thereto), and the Floodplain Zoning Map (see
§ 510-167).
H. Boundary. The Shoreland-Wetland District includes all wetlands in the
Village of East Troy which are five acres or more and are shown on the
wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this
section and which are:
(1) Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable
lakes, ponds, or flowages. Lakes, ponds, or flowages in the Village
of East Troy shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on
the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps.
(2) Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers
or streams or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever
distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be
navigable if they are designated as either continuous or
intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey
quadrangle maps.
I. Determination of navigability. Determinations of navigability and
ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the Zoning
Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall
contact the appropriate district office of the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources (WisDNR) for the final determination of navigability
or ordinary high-water mark.
J. Discrepancies. When an apparent discrepancy exists between the SW
District boundary shown on the Wisconsin wetland inventory map or
the Floodplain Zoning Map and the actual field conditions, the Zoning
Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the
WisDNR to determine if the SW District boundary as mapped is in error.
If WisDNR staff concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular
area was incorrectly mapped as a shoreland or wetland, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a
zoning or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable
to the underlying standard zoning district. In order to correct shoreland
and/or wetland mapping errors or acknowledge filled wetlands
§ 510-71 EAST TROY CODE § 510-71
1:858
designated in Subsection K, the Zoning Administrator shall be
responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable
period.334
K. Filled wetlands. Wetlands which were filled prior to July 2, 1987, the
date on which the Village received final wetland inventory maps, in a
manner which affects their wetland characteristics, to the extent that
the area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this
section.
L. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted subject to the
provisions of Chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats., and the provisions of other
local, state, and federal laws, if applicable:
(1) Activities and uses which do not require the issuance of a zoning
permit, provided that no wetland alteration occurs:
(a) Hiking, fishing, trapping, hunting, swimming, snowmobiling,
or boating.
(b) Harvesting of wild crops, such as marsh hay, ferns, moss, wild
rice, berries, tree fruits and tree seeds, in a manner that is not
injurious to the natural reproduction of such crops.
(c) Practice of silviculture, including the planting, thinning and
harvesting of timber.
(d) Pasturing of livestock.
(e) Cultivation.
(f) Construction and maintenance of duck blinds.
(2) Uses which do not require the issuance of a zoning permit and
which may involve wetland alterations only to the extent
specifically provided below:
(a) The practice of silviculture, including limited temporary water
level stabilization measures which are necessary to alleviate
abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse
impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected.
(b) The cultivation of cranberries, including limited wetland
alterations necessary for the purpose of growing and
harvesting cranberries.
(c) The maintenance and repair of existing drainage to restore
preexisting levels of drainage, including the minimum amount
of filling necessary to dispose of dredged spoil, provided that
the filling is otherwise permissible and that dredged spoil is
placed on existing spoil banks where possible.

M. Prohibited uses. Any use not listed in Subsection L of this section is
prohibited, unless the wetland or a portion of the wetland has been
§ 510-71 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-71
1:861
rezoned by amendment of this section in accordance with Subsection
O.
N. Nonconforming structures and uses. The lawful use of a building,
structure, or property which existed at the time this section, or an
applicable amendment to this section, took effect and which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this section, including the routine

§ 510-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-72
1:869
J. Nonconforming uses and structures. Existing facilities within the GP
Overlay District at the time of enactment of said district that may cause
or threaten to cause environmental pollution, including but not limited
to those listed on the WisDNR's Inventory of Sites or Facilities Which
May Cause or Threaten to Cause Environmental Pollution, Wisconsin
Department of Safety and Professional Services' list of underground
storage tanks, list of facilities with hazardous solid waste permits, and
all other facilities which are considered a prohibited use in Subsection
H or a conditional use in Subsection I, shall adhere to the following
additional requirements:
(1) Such facilities as above which exist within the district at the time of
enactment of a district shall provide copies of all current, revised,
or new federal, state, and local facility operation approvals, permits
or certificates, operational safety plans, and ongoing
environmental monitoring results to the Village for review by the
Groundwater Technical Review Committee.
(2) Such facilities as above which exist within the district at the time of
enactment of a district shall have the responsibility of devising,
filing, and maintaining with the Village a current contingency plan
which details how they intend to respond to any emergency which
may cause or threaten to cause environmental pollution that occurs
at their facility, including notifying municipal, county, and state
officials.
(3) Such facilities as above cannot engage in or employ a use, activity,
or structure listed as a prohibited use in Subsection H or a
conditional use in Subsection I which they did not engage in or
employ at the time of enactment of a district and can only expand,
replace, or rebuild those present uses, activities, equipment, or
structures on the site or property of record associated with the
facility at the time of enactment of a district and in a manner that
improves the environmental and safety technologies already being
utilized. No existing use, activity, or structure listed as a prohibited
use or conditional use shall be expanded, replaced, or rebuilt
unless a conditional use permit is granted for such expansion,
replacement, or rebuilding. This subsection does not apply to
normal maintenance or minor repairs.
(4) If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future use of the
building, structure or property shall conform to the appropriate
provisions of this chapter.
K. Changing technology.
(1) The uses prohibited by the GP Overlay District are prohibited based
upon the combined pollution experience of many individual uses
and the technology generally employed by a particular use
considered to be of a high risk for pollution to the groundwater
§ 510-72 EAST TROY CODE § 510-72
1:870
§ 510-73. Natural Features Conservancy Overlay District.
resource. As the technology of other uses changes to low- or nonrisk
materials or methods, upon petition from such use, after
conferring with the Groundwater Technical Review Committee or
other expert opinion, and after appropriate public notice and
hearing, the Village, through appropriate procedures and
amendments to this chapter, may remove from the designated
prohibited uses list such uses that are convincingly demonstrated
to no longer pose a groundwater pollution hazard.
(2) In dealing with uses which attempt to become permissible under
the terms of this district by continuing to utilize pollutant materials
by altering their processing, storage, and/or handling, it is not the
intention to accept alternate or reduced hazards as the basis for
making a use permissible. It is the intention to continue a
prohibition on such uses until the technology of the use removes
reliance upon the pollutant materials or processes deemed to be a
groundwater hazard.
L. Enforcement and penalty. Any person who violates, neglects, or refuses
to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to a
penalty as provided in § 510-153 of this chapter.
(1) In addition to any other remedy, the Village of East Troy may seek
an injunction or restraining order against the party alleged to have
violated the provisions herein, the cost of which shall be charged to
the defendant in such action.
(2) As a substitute for and in addition to any other action, the Village of
East Troy may commence legal action against both the person who
releases the contaminants and the owner of the facility the
contaminants were released from to recover the costs of cleanup
together with the costs of prosecution. Any person who causes the
release of any contaminants which may endanger or contaminate
the municipal water supply system associated with a GP Overlay
District shall immediately cease such discharge and immediately
initiate cleanup satisfactory to the Village of East Troy and other
state and federal regulatory agencies. The person who releases
such contaminants and the person who owns the facility the
contaminants have been released from shall be jointly and solely
responsible for the cost of cleanup, consultant or other contractor
fees, including all administrative costs for oversight, and review
and documentation, including the Village employees, equipment,
and mileage.
A. Purpose. This district is intended to be used to preserve, protect,
enhance, and restore areas of rough topography and areas where
depressions in the terrain alternate with small hills, forming kettle and
kame topography. Regulation of these areas will serve to protect unique
topographic features from encroachment by urban development,

Figure 510-77A: Sample Overall Design Theme
B. Residential construction. Proposed residential construction within the
Downtown Design District, including new structures, building
additions, building alterations, and restoration or rehabilitation, shall
be reviewed by the Plan Commission. The building setback, height,
mass, roof form, exterior materials, exterior surface appurtenances,
exterior colors, landscaping, and lighting shall be compatible and
harmonious with the overall design theme noted above.
C. Nonresidential design standards. Nonresidential construction,
including new structures, building additions, building alterations, and
restoration or rehabilitation, shall correspond to the urban design
guidelines and the following requirements:
(1) Building setbacks. Throughout the district, the setback of buildings
from street yard and side yard property lines shall be compatible
with existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to the
overall design theme noted above.
(2) Building height. Throughout the district, the height of buildings
shall be compatible with existing buildings in the immediate area
which conform to the overall design theme noted above. In no
§ 510-77 EAST TROY CODE § 510-77

be compatible with existing buildings in the immediate area which
conform to the overall design theme. The characteristic proportion
(relationship between facade height and width) of the overall
design theme shall be maintained. Building mass for large
structures (with a facade area exceeding 5,000 square feet) shall
be disguised through the use of facade articulations or through the
use of exterior treatments which give the impression of directly
adjoining individual buildings.
(4) Horizontal rhythms. The horizontal pattern of exterior building
elements formed by patterns of building openings for windows and
doors and related elements such as piers and columns shall be
spaced at regular intervals across all visible facades of the building
and shall be compatible with those of existing buildings in the
immediate area which conform to the overall design theme.
(5) Vertical rhythms. The floor heights on main facades shall appear

ARTICLE XII
Planned Developments
§ 510-80. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide regulations which govern the
procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of
proposed planned developments and to provide for the possible relaxation
of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard
zoning district (see Articles II, III, IV and V). In exchange for such flexibility,
planned developments shall provide a much higher level of site design,
architectural control, and other aspects of aesthetic and functional
excellence than normally required for other developments.
§ 510-81. Intent.
Planned developments are intended to encourage, promote, and provide
improved environmental design by allowing for greater freedom,
imagination, and flexibility in the development of land while ensuring
substantial compliance with the basic intent of this chapter and the Village
of East Troy Comprehensive Plan. To this end, planned developments allow
diversification and variation in the relationship of uses, structures, open
spaces, and heights of structures in developments conceived and
implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is further
intended to encourage economic development and more rational
developments with regard to public services and to encourage and facilitate
preservation of open space and natural resources. Planned developments
are not intended to circumvent the intent of other zoning districts or this
chapter.
§ 510-82. Permitted locations.
Planned developments shall be permitted in a location where a Planned
Development Overlay District (see Article X) has been depicted on the
Overlay Zoning District Map (see § 510-68).
§ 510-83. Provision of flexibility.
The following exemptions to the development standards of the underlying
standard zoning district may be provided with the approval of a planned
development:
A. Land use requirements. All land uses listed as residential, institutional,
industrial or commercial may be permitted within a planned
development. [Amended 10-21-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-05]
B. Density, intensity, and bulk requirements. All requirements listed in
Articles VII and VIII for residential density and nonresidential intensity
may be waived within a planned development.
§ 510-80 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-83
1:885
§ 510-84. Application requirements and procedure.
§ 510-85. Preapplication conference.
C. Parking and loading requirements. All requirements listed in §§ 510-93
and 510-94 may be waived within a planned development.
D. Only development improvements which are explicitly depicted on the
required site plan approved by the Village Board as part of the planned
development shall be permitted, even if such development
improvements (including all aspects of land use, density, intensity, bulk,
landscaping, parking, and loading) are otherwise listed as permitted in
this chapter. Requested exemptions from these standards shall be made
explicit in the application and shall be recommended by the Plan
Commission and approved explicitly by the Village Board. If not so
requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted.
A. Initiation of planned development procedure. Proceedings for approval
of a planned development shall be initiated by an application of the
owner(s) of the subject property, a recommendation of the Plan
Commission to the Village Board, or by action of the Village Board.
B. Review and approval. Steps included in the planned development
review and approval process are outlined in §§ 510-85 through 510-88
below.
(1) The process for review and approval of the general development
plan (GDP) shall be identical to that for Official Zoning Map
amendments per § 510-155 of this chapter and (if land is to be
divided) to that for preliminary and final plats of subdivision per
Chapter 495, Subdivision of Land, of the Village Code.
(2) The process for review and approval of the final development plan
(FDP) shall be identical to that for site plans per § 510-160 of this
chapter and (if land is to be divided) to that for preliminary and
final plats of subdivision per Chapter 495, Subdivision of Land, of
the Village Code.
A. The applicant shall contact the Zoning Administrator to place an
informal discussion item for the planned development on the Plan
Commission agenda. No details beyond the name of the applicant and
the identification of the discussion item as a planned development are
required to be given in the agenda.
B. At the Plan Commission meeting, the applicant shall engage in an
informal discussion with the Plan Commission regarding the potential
planned development. Appropriate topics for discussion may include
the location of the planned development, general project themes and
images, the general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses being
considered, approximate residential densities and nonresidential
intensities, the general treatment of natural features, the general

B. Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process
shall in no way be binding upon the applicant or the Village but should
be considered as the informal, nonbinding basis for proceeding to the
next step. The preferred procedure is for one or more iterations of Plan
Commission review of the concept plan to occur prior to introduction of
the formal petition for rezoning which accompanies the general
development plan application (see § 510-87).
C. Contents of the concept plan submittal shall include the following

ARTICLE XIII
Performance Standards
§ 510-89. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to indicate the standards and minimum
requirements for exterior site and building design, access, visibility, offstreet
parking and traffic circulation, off-street loading, exterior lighting,
exterior storage, fencing, swimming pools, vibration, noise, air pollution,
odor, signal receiving antennas, glare and heat, fire and explosions, toxic
or noxious materials, waste materials, exterior construction material,
hazardous materials, group and large developments, and outdoor woodburning
furnaces within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Any nonconforming
situation (lot, use, structure and/or site) shall adhere to the provisions of
Article IX.
§ 510-90. Exterior site and building design standards.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the design and
materials used for the exterior of buildings and structures within the
Village so as to attain a degree of uniformity in exterior appearance and
quality of materials and thus maintain and enhance the attractiveness
and values of property in the community.
B. Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all structures
and buildings within the Village. Beyond the general rules in
Subsections C through J below, additional rules apply to group and
large developments, which are provided in §§ 510-108 and 510-109.
C. Review and approval. Through the site plan review process, the Plan
Commission shall be responsible and have authority to hear, review, and
act upon all proposed exterior architectural plans for all proposed
development, except as exempt under § 510-36N.
D. Site design. In addition to complying with required setbacks, no
building, structure, pavement, or improvement shall be placed or
oriented in a manner that would unnecessarily reduce the appearance
of the subject property in comparison to typical development practices
that are fully consistent with the requirements of this chapter or would
have a substantial negative impact on the value or enjoyment of
permitted land uses on nearby properties.
E. Avoidance of exteriors specific to a particular occupant. Trademark
architecture is prohibited. Specifically, no building, other structures,
pavement or improvement shall have an integral exterior design which
is specific to a particular site occupant, including exterior building
forms, materials, textures, colors, and patterns. Exterior elements
which are specific to a particular site occupant shall be limited to
attached signage, awnings and other appurtenances which are easy to
remove or modify for subsequent site occupants without causing
significant damage and/or restoration expenses.
§ 510-89 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-90
1:893
F. Exterior design compatibility and avoidance of monotony. No building,
other structures, pavement or improvement shall have an exterior
design which is of such unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to
its surroundings as to be unsightly or offensive to generally accepted
taste. In addition, no building shall be permitted within any residential
or business zoning district to have an exterior appearance which is too
similar to nearby buildings so as to create unacceptable monotony.
Restrictive covenants shall incorporate provisions to prohibit
unacceptable monotony of the design, materials and colors for building
exteriors for any multi-lot or group development.
G. Requirements for exterior materials. The following requirements shall
apply regarding exterior materials for buildings and structures:
(1) Building color. Building facade colors shall be nonreflective, subtle,
neutral, or earth tone. The use of high-intensity colors, metallic
colors, fluorescent colors, or black on facades shall be prohibited.
Building trim and architectural accent elements may feature bright
colors or black, but such colors shall be muted, not metallic, not
fluorescent, and not specific to particular uses or tenants. Standard
corporate and trademark colors shall be permitted only on signage,
subject to the limitations in Article XV.
(2) Building materials. Exterior building materials shall be of
comparable aesthetic quality on all sides. Building materials such
as glass, brick, tinted, and decorative concrete block, wood, stucco,
and exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS) shall be used, as
determined appropriate by the Plan Commission. Decorative
architectural metal with concealed fasteners or decorative tilt-up
concrete panels may be approved if incorporated into the overall
design of the building.
(3) Prohibited materials. No building or structure shall be constructed
or faced with any material or texture which is aesthetically
incompatible with other building exteriors in the area which are
fully consistent with the requirements of this chapter or which
presents an unattractive appearance to the public or surrounding
properties. The following materials are prohibited on the exterior
of all buildings and structures:
(a) Plain faced concrete walls or panels.
(b) Plain faced cinder block or concrete block.
(c) Asphaltic siding.
(d) Plywood, chipboard, or other nondecorative wood or composite
material as determined by the Plan Commission.
(e) Metal siding which does not meet any one or more of the
following exceptions:
§ 510-90 EAST TROY CODE § 510-90
1:894
[1] Is determined by the Plan Commission to be a decorative
element of the building or structure that can be readily
removed or replaced with a permitted exterior material.
[2] Uses a method of exterior wall fastening which is fully
concealed from view by means of an interlocking panel,
panel overlap, or other method approved by the Plan
Commission which results in full concealment.
[3] Uses visible exterior fasteners which are the same color as
the attached wall for any principal or accessory structure
within the Rural Holding (RH-35), Highway Business (HB),
Business Park (BP), Light Industrial (LI), or General
Industrial (GI) Zoning District, in any location on the
building or structure which meets all of the following
criteria:
[a] Is located more than 100 feet from any portion of a
residential zoning district boundary and more than
100 feet from any portion of a public right-of-way.
[b] Is located more than 100 feet from any visitor or
customer door.
[c] Transitions to any other exterior material, texture,
color, or pattern at a building corner, pier, pilaster,
eave, parapet, or other physical change in the wall
plane, so as to complement the overall exterior design
of the building or structure as determined by the Plan
Commission.
(f) Fiberglass or poly-roofing or siding.
(g) Other materials as determined by the Plan Commission.
(h) Structures exceeding 100 square feet which are not erected on
a permanent foundation and/or do not comply with the Uniform
Building Code.
H. Waste receptacles. The development shall contain a sufficient number
of waste bins to accommodate all trash and recyclable materials
generated by the land uses in a convenient manner and in accordance
with the building design and performance standards of this article.

access drives on the subject property.
D. Number of access points.
(1) Each lot shall have not more than two access points on any street
frontage adjacent to any lot. Said access shall require approval by
the Director of Public Works.
(2) No lot shall be permitted more than one access point on any one
street if its frontage on said street is less than 100 linear feet (as
measured along the right-of-way line).
(3) On arterial streets, and in areas experiencing, or expected to
experience, congestion and/or safety problems, access to a lot may
be required to be located via an access point located on an adjacent
property or another street frontage.
(4) For residential uses, two access points serving the same street
frontage may be approved as a conditional use.
E. Residential uses. Residential uses shall not have access points onto a
nonresidential collector or arterial street unless such street has the
only available frontage.
F. Nonresidential uses. Nonresidential uses shall not have access points
onto a residential street unless such street has the only available
frontage.
G. Access near street intersections. At its intersection with the street
right-of-way line on an arterial or nonresidential collector street, no
access point shall be located closer than 100 feet to the intersection of
any two street rights-of-way unless such street is the only available
frontage on the subject property. In all cases, access points shall be
located as far from an intersection as the lot size permits.

except as part of site plan review and approval.
H. Distance between access drives. The minimum distance between access
drives serving the same property shall be 25 feet (edge to edge), as
measured at the property line. A distance in excess of 25 feet may be
required if existing or projected traffic warrants a greater distance.
I. Angle of intersection with public right-of-way. All access drives shall
intersect with any public right-of-way at an angle of not less than 75°
and shall intersect at an angle of 90° wherever possible.
J. Distance from property line. The distance from a nonresidential access
drive to the property line of an adjacent property shall not be less than
five feet, as measured along the right-of-way line. [Amended
11-20-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-15]
K. Width of driveways. All access drives shall have a minimum width of 10
feet for single- and two-family dwellings and 18 feet for all other land
uses. All curb openings for access drives shall have a maximum width of
24 feet for all residential uses and 30 feet for all nonresidential uses, as
measured at the right-of-way line. Access drives may be flared between
the right-of-way line and the roadway up to a maximum of five
additional feet. This requirement may be exceeded with explicit Plan
Commission approval for uses other than single family.
L. Traffic control. The traffic generated by any use shall be channelized
and controlled in a manner which avoids congestion on public streets
and other safety hazards. Traffic into and out of all off-street parking,
loading, and traffic circulation areas serving six or more parking spaces
shall be forward moving, with no backing into streets or
pedestrianways. Traffic control devices shall be required as determined
by the Director of Public Works.
M. Depiction on required site plan. Any and all proposed access drives on
the subject property shall be depicted as to their location and

subject property.
N. Paving of access. All access approach areas located within a street
right-of-way shall be paved to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator with a hard, all-weather surface and shall be maintained
so as to prevent the transport of gravel, dirt, or other eroded material
from the subject property into the right-of-way. This requirement must
be fulfilled before building occupancy, unless granted a time-specific
extension in writing by the Zoning Administrator.
A. Surfacing. Driveways and any related parking area shall be hardsurfaced
with asphaltic pavement, concrete pavement, or pavers that
§ 510-91 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-91.1
1:897
provide the same structural support as the aforementioned. Such
surface must be completed within 12 months following occupancy of a
new construction.
B. Drainage. Driveways and any related parking area shall be graded and
drained to not cause a nuisance to adjoining properties.
C. Setback. Driveways and any related parking area must be set back at
least five feet from side lot lines, except as allowed in this subsection. A
shared driveway may be located along a common lot line. A driveway
accessing the bulb of a cul-de-sac street may be closer than five feet to a
side lot line within 20 feet of the front lot line.
D. Minimum width. The minimum width of a driveway is 10 feet.

general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for
the provision of off-street parking and circulation in accordance with
the utilization of various sites.
B. Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to all new
development.
C. Review and approval. Through the site plan review process (see
§ 510-160), the Plan Commission shall review and approve all
development for conformance with this section.
D. Depiction on required site plan. Any and all parking and traffic
circulation areas proposed to be located on the subject property shall
be depicted as to their location and configuration on the site plan
required for the development of the subject property. Each and every
on-site parking space designed to serve as required parking shall not be
located farther than 300 feet, except as permitted by a conditional use
permit, of shortest walking distance from the access to all of the various
areas it is designated to serve. A garage stall, meeting the access
requirements of Subsection F(4) below, shall be considered a parking
space. Parking spaces for any and all vehicles exceeding 18 feet in
length shall be clearly indicated on said site plan.
E. Minimum required off-street parking spaces. Off-street parking
requirements for each land use (see Article VI) are generally tied to the
use's capacity and gross floor area or the number of employees at the
subject property during the largest work shift. The term "capacity"
means the maximum number of persons that may be accommodated by
the use as determined by its design or by State Building Code
regulations, whichever number is greater. The term "employee(s) on
the largest work shift" means the maximum number of employees
working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time
period during which this occurs, and regardless of whether any such
person is a full-time employee. The largest work shift may occur on any
§ 510-92 EAST TROY CODE § 510-93
1:900
particular day of the week or during a lunch or dinner period in the
case of a restaurant. In all cases, one reserved parking space shall
be provided for each vehicle used by the operation during business
hours. Where said parking needs of any land use exceed the minimum
requirements of this chapter, additional parking spaces sufficient to
meet the average maximum weekly peak-hour parking space demand
shall be provided by said land use.
F. Off-street parking and traffic circulation standards.
(1) Circulation. The site shall be designed to provide for the safe and
efficient movement of all traffic entering, exiting, and circulating
on the site. Circulation patterns shall conform to the general rules
of the road. All traffic control measures shall meet the
requirements of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
(2) Surfacing and marking. All off-street parking and traffic circulation
areas (including all residential driveways except those in the RH-35

that advances the goals of the Comprehensive Plan or other
adopted plan, policy, or regulation of the Village to the satisfaction
of the Director of Public Works. Said surfaces intended for six or
more parking stalls shall be marked in a manner which clearly
indicates required parking spaces.
(3) Curbing. All off-street parking areas designed to have head-in
parking within 6.5 feet of any lot line shall provide a tire bumper or
curb of adequate height and properly located to ensure that no part
of any vehicle will project beyond the required setbacks of this
chapter.
(4) Access. Each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an
aisle or driveway that is wide enough and designed to provide a
safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking space
without directly backing or maneuvering a vehicle into a public
right-of-way exceeding 82.5 feet in width. All off-street parking and
traffic circulation facilities shall be designed with an appropriate
means of vehicular access to a street or alley, in a manner which
least interferes with traffic movements. No driveway across public
property, or requiring a curb cut, shall exceed a width of 40 feet for
commercial and industrial land uses or 25 feet for residential land
uses (see Figure 510-93A). Off-street parking spaces for residential
uses may be stacked or in front of one another for the same
building unit. Parking spaces located behind an enclosed garage
and located directly off a through aisle shall be a minimum of 30
feet deep.
(5) Snow storage. Required off-street parking and traffic circulation
areas shall not be used for snow storage.

between 0.4 and 1.0 footcandle is recommended for said areas, and
said illumination level shall not exceed the standards of § 510-95.
(7) Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required offstreet
parking or traffic circulation shall comply with the
requirements of Article XV.
(8) Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the
requirements of the paved area landscaping requirements in
Article XIV.
(9) Parking space design standards. Other than handicapped parking,
each off-street parking space shall comply with the minimum
requirements of Figure 510-93A. The minimum required length of
parking spaces shall be 16 feet. All parking spaces shall have a
minimum vertical clearance of at least seven feet.
(10) Handicapped parking spaces. Handicapped parking shall be
provided at a size, number, location, and with signage as specified
by state and federal regulations.
(11) Parking lot design standards. Horizontal widths for parking rows,
aisles, and modules shall be provided at widths no less than listed

developments (see § 510-108) and large developments (see
§ 510-109).
(12) Partial development of required parking spaces. Any development
may seek permission to not install a portion of its required parking
at time of site plan review; however, the site plan shall depict the
minimum number of required parking spaces.
(13) Limit on the maximum number of required parking spaces. No site
plan may be approved for a multifamily or nonresidential use which
contains more than 120% of the development's minimum number of
required parking spaces, except as granted through a conditional
use permit.
G. Joint and off-site parking facilities.
(1) Parking facilities which have been approved by the Director of
Public Works to provide required parking for one or more uses shall
provide a total number of parking spaces which shall not be less
than the sum total of the separate parking needs for each use
during any peak hour parking period when said joint parking
facility is utilized at the same time by said uses. However, this
aggregate requirement may be reduced or expanded by the Plan
Commission by explicit motion associated with this site plan review
process.
§ 510-93 EAST TROY CODE § 510-93
1:902
(2) Each parking space designed to serve as joint parking shall not be
located farther than 300 feet, except as permitted by a conditional
use permit, from the access to all of the various areas it is
designated to serve.
(3) The applicant(s) for approval of a joint parking facility shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that
there is no substantial conflict in the demand for parking during the
principal operating hours of the two of more uses which the joint
parking facility is proposed to serve.
(4) A legally binding instrument, approved by the Village Attorney,
shall be executed by any and all parties to be served by a joint
parking facility. This instrument shall be recorded with the Register
of Deeds office and filed with the Village Clerk. A fee shall be
required to file this instrument (see § 510-149). [Amended
12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]

other areas located within a public right-of-way not explicitly
designated by the Director of Public Works.
J. Minimum permitted throat length. Figure 510-93B shall be used to
determine the minimum permitted throat length of access drives
serving parking lots as measured from the right-of-way line along the
center line of the access drive. This regulation may be modified by the
Plan Commission by explicit motion associated with this site review
process.
K. Potential reduction in parking. The Plan Commission may decrease the
required number of off-street automobile parking spaces by up to 25%
of the normal requirements based upon one or more of the following
criteria:
(1) Technical documentation furnished by the applicant that indicates,
to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission, that actual off-street
parking demand for that particular use is less than the required
standard set forth in this chapter.
(2) Bicycle parking spaces will be provided through racks, lockers, or
equivalent structures located convenient to the proposed use.
§ 510-93 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-93

detonation shall be located not less than 400 feet from any residential
or commercial zoning district, except that this standard shall not apply
to the storage or usage of liquefied petroleum or natural gas for normal
residential or business purposes. All activities and storage of flammable
and explosive materials at any point shall be provided with adequate
safety and fire-fighting devices in accordance with all fire prevention
codes of the State of Wisconsin.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the handling of toxic,
noxious, or waste material which adversely affects adjoining properties
in order to prevent the creation of nuisances and to promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of the public.
B. Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all land uses and
activities.
C. Standards. No use shall discharge across the boundaries of the subject
property, or through percolation into the subsoil, toxic or noxious
material in such concentration as to be detrimental to or endanger the
public health, safety, comfort, or welfare or cause injury or damage to
private property or business. No use shall discharge at any point into
any public or private sewage disposal system or stream, or into the
ground, any liquid or solid materials except in accordance with the
regulations of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

C. Standards. All land uses involving such hazardous materials shall
submit a written description of such materials and the operations
involving such materials conducted on their property as part of the
required site plan submittal.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish standards that
ensure group developments are properly located and are compatible
with the surrounding area and the overall community character of the
Village of East Troy.
B. Applicability. A group development is any development of one lot
comprised of any single instance or any combination of the items in
Subsection B(1) through (6) below. Common examples of group
developments include apartment or condominium complexes,
commercial centers, shopping centers, and office centers. A group
development does not offer the ability to customize regulations of this
chapter as could be achieved through a planned development under
Article XII.
(1) One or more principal multifamily residential structures with a
total of five or more residential units on the same parcel.
(2) Two or more principal structures on the same parcel, whether
currently serving a single use or more than one use.
§ 510-107 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-108
1:919
§ 510-109. Large development standards.
(3) A mixed-use structure used for office or commercial land uses
containing one or more nonresidential uses and one or more
residential uses.
(4) A single principal structure used for office or commercial land uses
with a gross floor area of 5,000 square feet or more.
(5) A single principal structure housing two or more leased or owned
tenant spaces.

the total gross floor area of all principal structures to 5,000 square
feet or greater or increases the total number of principal structures
on the same parcel to two or more.
C. Review and approval. All group developments require a conditional use
permit (see § 510-157 for review and approval procedure) regardless of
whether individual use(s) within the development is permitted by right
within the applicable district. The subsequent addition of structures,
additions to structures, and expansions of parking or storage areas
shall require amendment to the approved conditional use permit
regardless of individual land use(s).
D. Group development standards. In addition to the general site and
design standards as provided in § 510-90, the following standards and
regulations are applicable to all group developments:
(1) Subsequent changes to individual uses within a group development
are permitted so long as the new use is listed as a use which is
permitted by right within the applicable zoning district, unless the
group development conditional use permit placed explicit
restrictions on future uses.
(2) Subsequent individual land uses permitted by conditional use in the
zoning district shall be permitted within the group development
only under subsequent conditional use permit approvals for the
specific use, regardless of whether said use entails modifications to
the building and/or site layout.
(3) All site development occurring within a group development shall
comply with the applicable requirements of this chapter, including
but not limited to density, intensity, bulk, and setbacks; building
separation; building and site design standards; landscaping and
green space preservation; access, parking, loading, and unloading;
and signage.
(4) A group development also meeting the description for a large
development shall also meet all of the large development standards
in § 510-109.
§ 510-108 EAST TROY CODE § 510-109
1:920
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish application
requirements and standards that are intended to ensure that large
developments (as defined in Subsection B below) are properly located
and are compatible with the surrounding area and the overall
community character of the Village of East Troy.
B. Applicability. Large developments may contain any combination of one
or more of the following land uses: indoor sales or service, outdoor
display, indoor commercial entertainment, outdoor commercial
entertainment, in-vehicle sales or service, or commercial indoor
lodging. (Refer to Article VI for definitions and requirements for each
land use.) A large development is comprised of one or more contiguous
parcels or building sites for one or more of the above-listed land uses
within which the total combined gross floor area exceeds 20,000 square
feet, including indoor and outdoor storage and display areas, and where
one or both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The parking area is or will be served by an integrated system of offstreet
parking benefiting all or substantially all improvements
within such area.
(2) The area is or will be subject to reciprocal access rights benefiting
all or substantially all improvements within such area.
C. Review and approval. The review and approval process for large
developments shall adhere to the conditional use permit procedures
(see § 510-157). Large developments require a conditional use permit
regardless of whether individual use(s) within the development is
permitted by right within the applicable district; however, a separate
conditional use permit is not required where such developments are
part of a planned development (see Article XII).
(1) All additions or modifications to structures, outdoor display areas,
in-vehicle drives, parking, or outdoor storage areas that are part of
an approved large development shall require an amendment to the
conditional use permit.
(2) Subsequent changes to individual land uses listed as permitted by
right uses within the applicable zoning district are permitted
without amendment to the large development conditional use
permit, unless said conditional use permit placed restrictions on
change of use.
(3) Subsequent individual land uses which are permitted only with a
conditional use permit may be allowed only under a subsequent
conditional use permit for the specific use, regardless of whether
said use entails modifications to the building and/or site layout.
D. Application requirements. Large development projects shall submit the
following application materials to the Zoning Administrator in addition
to those required for a conditional use permit under § 510-157:

1:921
(1) Report. A written report providing evidence that the proposed
building and overall development project will be compatible with
the Village of East Troy Comprehensive Plan, any detailed
neighborhood plan for the area, and any other plans officially
adopted by the Village.
(2) Questionnaire. A Large Development Questionnaire shall be
completed and provided in the format included in Figure
510-109.349
(3) Economic and fiscal analysis. The Village may require completion
of an economic and fiscal impact analysis containing the following
items:
(a) Estimate of types and number of jobs created, including fulltime
equivalent (40 hours per week) and part time (less than
40 hours per week).
(b) The impact of the project on the overall local job market at year
one and year five.
(c) Estimate of the amount of local labor to be used in the
construction of the project and in employment. "Local" is
defined as Village or county residents or businesses.
(d) Analysis indicating the market of the proposed project and the
area from which patrons will be attracted.
(e) Evaluate the impact of the proposed project on commercial
and/or retail vacancy rates in the proposed market area.
(f) Estimate to what extent the proposed project would reduce the
proposed market area's economic base by eliminating existing
businesses.
(g) Compare and evaluate the projected costs and benefits to the
community resulting from the project, including:
[1] Projected costs arising from increased demand for and
required improvements to public services and
infrastructure.
[2] Value of improvements to public services and
infrastructure to be provided by the project.
[3] Projected tax revenues to the Village to be generated by
the project in the first five years of business.
[4] Projected impact of the project in the first five years on
land values (both residential and commercial) and
349. Editor's Note: Figure 510-109 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 510-109 EAST TROY CODE § 510-109
1:922
potential loss or increase in tax revenues to the Village of
East Troy.
(4) Traffic impact analysis. The Village may require that a traffic
impact analysis be completed in accordance with the most current
revision of the Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines published by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation. In addition, the following
provisions are required for all large developments:
(a) All projects shall have direct access to an arterial or collector
street deemed appropriate by the Plan Commission.
(b) Vehicle access shall be designed to accommodate peak on-site
traffic volumes without disrupting traffic on public streets or
impairing pedestrian safety. This shall be accomplished
through adequate parking lot design and capacity; access drive
entry throat length; design, location, and number of traffic
control devices; and sidewalks.
(c) The site design shall provide direct connections to adjacent
land uses if required by the Village.
(d) Where the traffic impact analysis indicates that a project may
cause off-site public roads, intersections, or interchanges to
function below a level of service (LOS) C, the Village may deny
the application, require a size reduction in the proposed
development, and/or require the developer to construct and/or
pay for required off-site improvements to achieve a LOS C for a
planning horizon of a minimum of 10 years assuming full buildout
of the development.
(e) The Village has the option to require a trip generation study.
(5) Detailed neighborhood plan. For a development exceeding 80,000
square feet in total gross floor area of all combined buildings within
the development, the Village may require that a detailed
neighborhood plan be submitted and approved by the Plan
Commission and Village Board. The detailed neighborhood plan
shall be prepared for all areas within 1,500 feet of the subject
property, as measured from the outer perimeter of the subject
property or group of properties proposed for development, and any
other nearby lands as determined by the Plan Commission to be
part of the defined neighborhood. The detailed neighborhood plan
shall:
(a) Contain the following specific elements at a scale of not less
than one inch equals 400 feet:
[1] Land use with specific zoning districts and/or land uses.
[2] Transitional treatments such as berms and/or landscaping
between areas with differing land uses or character.
§ 510-109 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-109
1:923
[3] Complete transportation network, including pedestrian
and bicycle facilities and transit routes and stops, where
applicable.
[4] Conceptual stormwater management facilities.
[5] Proposed public facility sites, including parks, schools,
conservation areas, public safety facilities and public
utility facilities.
[6] Proposed community character themes, including building
materials, landscaping, streetscaping, and signage.
(b) Demonstrate that the proposed detailed neighborhood plan is
in harmony with the land use, multi-modal transportation,
utility, stormwater management, and community character
provisions of the Village's Comprehensive Plan.
E. Large development standards. In addition to the general exterior site
and building design standards as provided in § 510-90, the following
standards and regulations are applicable to all large developments. In
the event that the applicant desires a deviation or exception from any
requirements of this section, the applicant shall present justification for
such deviation or exception, which may be approved or denied by the
Village Board after recommendation by the Plan Commission.
(1) Building location. Where buildings are proposed to be distant from
a public street, as determined by the Plan Commission, the overall
development design shall include smaller buildings on pads or
outlots closer to the street. Placement and orientation must
facilitate appropriate land use transitions and appropriate traffic
flow to adjoining roads and neighboring commercial areas and
neighborhoods and must advance community character objectives
as described in the Village's Comprehensive Plan.
(2) Building design. The building exterior shall complement other
buildings in the vicinity and shall be of a design determined
appropriate by the Plan Commission, including the following:
(a) The building shall employ varying setbacks, heights, roof
treatments, doorways, window openings, and other structural
or decorative elements to reduce apparent size and scale of the
building.
(b) A minimum of 20% of the structure's facades that are visible
from public streets shall employ actual protrusions or recesses
with a depth of at least six feet. No uninterrupted facade shall
extend more than 100 feet.
(c) Ground floor facades that face and are within 300 feet of any
public streets shall have arcades (i.e., a series of outdoor
spaces located under a roof or overhang and supported by
§ 510-109 EAST TROY CODE § 510-109
1:924
columns or arches), display windows, entry areas, awnings, or
other such features along no less than 50% of their horizontal
length.
(d) The integration of windows into building design is required,
and they shall be transparent, clear glass (not tinted or
spandrel glass) between three to eight feet above the walkway
along any facades facing a public street. The use of blinds shall
be acceptable where there is a desire for opacity.
(e) A minimum of 20% of all of the combined linear roof eave or
parapet lines of the structure shall employ differences in
height, with such differences being six feet or more as
measured eave to eave or parapet to parapet.
(f) Roofs with particular pitches may be required by the Village to
complement existing buildings or otherwise establish a
particular aesthetic objective.
(g) Building facades shall include a repeating pattern that includes
no fewer than three of the following elements: color change,
texture change, material modular change, and/or expression of
architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no
less than 24 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal or
projecting rib. At least one of these elements shall repeat
horizontally. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more
than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically.
(h) Public building entryways shall be clearly defined and highly
visible on the building's exterior design and shall be
emphasized by on-site traffic flow patterns. Two or more of the
following design features shall be incorporated into all public
building entryways: canopies or porticos, overhangs,
projections, arcades, peaked roof forms, arches, outdoor
patios, display windows, and/or distinct architectural details.
When additional stores located in the principal building exceed
30% of the gross floor area, separate entrances may be
required by the Village for each such store that shall conform
to the above requirements.
(3) Screening.
(a) All ground-mounted and wall-mounted mechanical equipment,
refuse containers and any permitted outdoor storage shall be
fully concealed from on-site and off-site ground-level views
with materials identical to those used on the building exterior.
(b) All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened by
parapets, upper stories, or other areas of exterior walls or
roofs so as to not be visible from public streets adjacent to or
within 1,000 feet of the subject property. Fences or similar
§ 510-109 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-109
1:925
rooftop screening devices may not be used to meet this
requirement.
(c) Loading docks shall be completely screened from surrounding
roads and properties. Said screening may be accomplished
through loading areas internal to buildings, screen walls which
match the building exterior in materials and design, fully
opaque landscaping at time of planting, or combinations of the

(a) The entire development shall provide for safe pedestrian and
bicycle access to all uses within the development, connections
to existing and planned public pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
and connections to adjacent properties.
(b) Pedestrian walkways shall be provided from all building
entrances to existing or planned public sidewalks or
§ 510-109 EAST TROY CODE § 510-109
1:926
pedestrian/bike facilities. The minimum width for sidewalks
adjacent to buildings shall be 10 feet, and the minimum width
for sidewalks elsewhere in the development shall be five feet.
(c) Sidewalks other than street sidewalks or building aprons shall
have adjoining landscaping along at least 50% of their length.
Such landscaping shall match the landscaping used for the
street frontages.
(d) Crosswalks shall be distinguished from driving surfaces to

appropriate locations at a minimum rate of one seat for every
20,000 square feet of gross floor area.
(g) The development shall provide interior pedestrian furniture in
appropriate locations at a minimum rate of one bench seat for
every 10,000 square feet of gross floor area. Seating in food
service areas or other areas where food or merchandise
purchasing activities occur shall not count toward this
requirement. A minimum of four seats shall be located within
the store, with a clear view through exit doors to a passenger
pickup or dropoff area.
(6) Central areas and features. Each development exceeding 80,000
square feet in total gross floor area shall provide a central area(s)
and/or feature(s) such as a patio/seating area, pedestrian plaza
with benches, outdoor playground area, water feature, and/or
other such deliberately designated areas or focal points that
adequately enhance the development or community. All such areas
shall be openly accessible to the public, connected to the public and
private sidewalk system, and designed with materials compatible
with the building and remainder of the site and shall be maintained
over the life of the building project.
(7) Cart returns. A minimum of one two-hundred-square-foot cart
return area shall be provided for every 100 parking spaces. Cart
corrals shall be of durable, nonrusting, all-season construction and
shall be designed and colored to be compatible with the building

outdoor storage uses and areas shall be appropriately screened as
required by Subsection E(3).
(10) Signage. The plan for exterior signage shall provide for modest,
coordinated, and complimentary exterior sign locations,
configurations, and color throughout the development, including
outlots. All freestanding signage within the development shall
complement on-building signage. Monument-style ground signs are
required and shall not exceed a height of eight feet. Consolidated
signs for multiple users may be required instead of multiple
individual signs. The Village may require the use of muted
corporate colors on signage if proposed colors are not compatible
with the Village's design objectives for the area. The use of logos,
slogans, symbols, patterns, striping and other markings, and colors
associated with a franchise or chain is permitted and shall be
considered as contributing to the number and area of permitted
signs.
(11) Natural resources protection. Each project shall meet the erosion
control and stormwater management standards in the Village of
East Troy Municipal Code. In addition, post-development runoff
rates shall not exceed presettlement rates. In general, existing
natural features shall be integrated into the site design as a site
and community amenity. Maintenance of any stormwater detention
or conveyance features is solely borne by the developer/owner
unless dedicated and accepted by the Village.
F. Additional requirements. All large developments are subject to the
following additional requirements:
(1) Where such a building is proposed as a replacement location for a
business already located within the Village, the Village shall
prohibit any privately imposed limits on the type or reuse of the
previously occupied building through conditions of sale or lease.
(2) The developer shall enter into a development agreement with the
Village which shall include the payment of all utilities, including but
not limited to stormwater, sanitary sewer, and street infrastructure.

§ 510-110. (Reserved)350
§ 510-111. Administration and enforcement.
Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of
performance standards set forth in this article range from those which can
be made with satisfactory accuracy by a reasonable person using normal
senses and no mechanical equipment to those requiring great technical
competence and complex equipment for precise measurement. It is the
intent of this chapter that:
Off-site improvements may also be required as part of the
development agreement.
(3) No individual building shall exceed a total of 155,000 square feet in
gross floor area. This cap may not be exceeded through the planned
development process.
(4) All buildings on outlots shall be of architectural quality comparable
to the primary structure, as determined by the Plan Commission.
A. Where determinations can be made by the Zoning Administrator using
equipment normally available to the Village or obtainable without
extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before
notice of violation is issued.
B. Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it
unreasonable for the Village to maintain the personnel or equipment
necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures
shall be available for causing corrections of apparent violations of
performance standards, for protecting individuals from arbitrary,
capricious, and unreasonable administration and enforcement of
performance standard regulations, and for protecting the general
public from unnecessary costs for administration and enforcement.
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice, by certified
mail or other means, ensuring a signed receipt for such notice, to
the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. The
notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the
reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there is a violation
in fact and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged
violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
(2) The notice shall state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply
or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator within the time limit set constitutes admission of
violation of the terms of this chapter. The notice shall further state
that upon request of those to whom it is directed, technical
determination as described in this chapter will be made, and that if

violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall
be charged against those responsible for the violation, in addition
to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is
determined that no violation exists, the cost of the determination
will be paid by the Village.

ARTICLE XIV
Landscaping Requirements
§ 510-112. Purpose.351
The purpose of this article is to establish landscaping requirements and
other regulations intended to preserve and maintain vegetation in a manner
that promotes the natural resource protection, aesthetic, and public health
goals of the Village of East Troy. Any nonconforming situation (lot, use,
structure and/or site) shall adhere to the provisions of Article IX.
§ 510-113. Interpretation.
§ 510-114. Landscaping points.
All landscaping requirements are stated in terms of the number of
landscaping points required. The required number of landscaping points
is dependent upon the type of land use, the zoning district, and the size
of the development. Points are awarded based on plant type, which is
dependent upon its typical growth rate, its mature height, and whether it is
a deciduous or evergreen species. Figure 510-114 itemizes the number of
points awarded per plant type and the minimum installation size required
for each of these plant categories.
A. This article contains the standards which govern the amount, size, type,
installation and maintenance of required landscaping. This article
recognizes the important and diverse benefits which landscaping
provides in terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare
of the community.
B. Each section of this article is oriented to a specific category of required
landscaping. The landscaping requirements described in this article are
cumulative in nature and are required for all development, except
single-family residential and agricultural uses, in the following
locations: around building foundations, in developed lots, along street
frontages, in or around paved areas, in permanently protected green
space areas, in reforestation areas, and in bufferyards.
C. In each instance, a "landscaping point" concept is used to provide a
maximum amount of flexibility in terms of the selection of plant
materials. Sections 510-114 and 510-115 present sample landscape
point combination alternatives used by this chapter.

§ 510-115. Sample landscaping schemes.
A. Sample landscaping schemes that may be used for building
foundations, developed lots, street frontages, paved areas,

B. A minimum amount of landscaping points, based upon the zoning
district, is required for the linear feet of building foundations; the gross
area of buildings on developed lots; the linear feet of street frontage;
and the total combined area of paved areas. Figure 510-115B illustrates
the measurement techniques used to determine these requirements.
§ 510-115 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-115
1:935
§ 510-116. Landscaping requirements for regular developments.
Figure 510-115B: Measurement for Landscaping Requirements
Landscaping calculation equations for this example:
Paved area = (P1 x P2) + (P3 x P4) + (P5 x P6) + (P7 x P8) + (P9 x
P10)
Street frontage = S1 + S2
Building perimeter = F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + F5 + F6 + F7 + F8
Building floor area = (B1 x B2) + (B3 x B4) + (B5 x B6)
A. Building foundations. As indicated in Figure 510-116,352 certain
buildings or building additions constructed after the effective date of
this chapter are required to be accented by a minimum amount of
landscaping placed near the building foundation.
(1) Foundation landscaping shall be placed so that, at maturity, the
plant's drip line is located within 10 feet of the building foundation.
Such landscaping shall not be located in those areas required for
landscaping as street frontages, paved areas, protected green
space areas, reforestation areas, or bufferyards. Foundation
landscaping shall be installed and permanently maintained in
conformity with the requirements of §§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(2) For each 100 feet of building foundation perimeter, the landscaping
installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points
specified in Figure 510-116. The actual number of points required
for such landscaping shall be computed on a prorated basis and
352. Editor's Note: Figure 510-116 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 510-115 EAST TROY CODE § 510-116
1:936
installed and permanently maintained per the requirements of
§§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(3) Climax trees and tall trees shall not be used to meet the foundation
landscaping requirement. The intent of this section is to require a
visual break in the mass of buildings and to require a visual screen
of a minimum of six feet in height for all exterior perimeter
appurtenances (such as HVAC/utility boxes, standpipes,
stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes).
(4) If the officially approved site plan depicts a future building
extension, the foundation landscaping requirement shall be
calculated by measuring the length of the total perimeter. However,
foundation plantings need only be installed based on the landscape
points calculated from the portions of the building perimeter that
will not be affected by building extension. If this results in a point
requirement not met by the initial planting, then the requirement
shall be met within five years after the issuance of the building
permit or within such larger time period as established in writing
by the Plan Commission.
B. Street frontages. As indicated in Figure 510-116, street frontages on
certain lots developed after the effective date of this chapter must
contain a minimum amount of landscaping in those areas abutting the
right-of-way of a public street.
(1) All landscaping used to meet street frontage requirements shall be
located within 10 feet of the public right-of-way. Under no
circumstances shall such landscaping be located within a public
right-of-way. Landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian
visibility and shall be installed and permanently maintained in
conformity with the requirements of §§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(2) For every 100 linear feet of street frontage of a developed lot
abutting a public street right-of-way, the landscape installed shall
at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in
Figure 510-116. The actual number of points required for such
landscaping shall be computed on a prorated basis and installed
and maintained per the requirements of §§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(3) Shrubs shall not be used to meet street frontage landscaping
requirements. A minimum of 50% of all points shall be devoted to
climax or tall trees, or a combination of such trees, and a minimum
of 30% of all points shall be devoted to medium trees.
C. Paved areas. As indicated in Figure 510-116, paved areas on certain lots
developed after the effective date of this chapter must contain a
minimum amount of landscaping within 10 feet of the paved area. The
intent is to require a continuous visual screen of parking areas from
public rights-of-way at a minimum height of 40 inches.
§ 510-116 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-116
1:937
(1) A minimum of 360 square feet of landscaped area, which shall be
located within 10 feet of the paved area, is required for the
placement of every 100 paved area landscaping points. Said area
does not have to be provided in one contiguous area. Sample
configurations are depicted in Figure 510-115A above. Plants used
to fulfill this requirement shall visually screen parking, loading and
circulation areas from view from public streets. Paved area
landscaping shall be installed and permanently maintained in
conformity with the requirements of §§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(2) For every 20 off-street parking stalls or 10,000 square feet of
pavement (whichever yields the greater landscaping requirement)
located in a development, the landscaping installed shall at a
minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in
Figure 510-116. The actual number of points required for such
landscaping shall be computed on a prorated basis and installed
and maintained per the requirements of §§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(3) A minimum of 30% of all points shall be devoted to climax or tall
trees, or a combination of such trees, and a minimum of 40% of all
points shall be devoted to shrubs.
(4) Parking lot design shall employ interior landscaped islands with a
minimum of 400 square feet at all parking aisle ends and in
addition shall provide a minimum of one landscaped island of a
minimum of 400 square feet in each parking aisle for every 20 cars
in that aisle. Aisle-end islands shall count toward meeting this
requirement. Landscaped medians shall be used to break large
parking areas into distinct pods, with a maximum of 100 spaces in
any one pod.
D. Developed lots. As indicated in Figure 510-116, lots developed after the
effective date of this chapter must contain a minimum amount of
landscaping.
(1) Landscaping required by this section is most effective if located
away from those areas required for landscaping as building
foundations, street frontages, paved areas, protected green space
areas, reforestation areas, or bufferyards.
(2) The number of landscaping points specified in Figure 510-116 shall
be provided on a prorated basis for every 1,000 square feet of gross
floor area and installed and maintained per the requirements of
§§ 510-121 and 510-122.
(3) The intent of this section is to provide yard shade and to require a
visual screen of a minimum of six feet in height for all detached
exterior appurtenances (such as HVAC/utility boxes, standpipes,
stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes).
§ 510-116 EAST TROY CODE § 510-117
1:938
§ 510-117. Permanently protected green space.
This section requires that each acre of other permanently protected green
space after the effective date of this chapter be planted with a minimum
amount of landscaping. For every one acre of other permanently protected
green space in a development, 200 landscaping points (as described in
§ 510-114) shall be provided. In addition, adequate ground cover shall be
provided to stabilize the soil.
§ 510-118. Reforestation requirements.
This section requires that each area requiring reforestation be reforested
and maintained in a manner appropriate to site conditions. The provisions
of this section are designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as
part of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and
reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental
functions that woodlands provide. A detailed reforestation plan shall be
submitted by the property owner and approved by the Village prior to
clear-cutting (see § 510-40E). This plan shall be reviewed by a reforestation
consultant chosen by the Village, with funding for consulting services
provided by the petitioner to the Village.
§ 510-119. Bufferyard requirements.
A. Purpose. This section provides the landscaping and width requirements
for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this chapter.
A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier.
It includes an area together with the combination of plantings, berms
and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or
potential nuisances. These nuisances can often occur between adjacent
zoning districts. Such nuisances are dirt, litter, noise, glare, signs, and
incompatible land uses, buildings, or parking areas.
B. Required locations for bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located along
(and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning
districts abut one another. Bufferyards shall not be required in front
yards.
C. Determination of required bufferyard opacity. The required level of
bufferyard opacity is determined using Figure 510-119A.353 Opacity is a
quantitatively derived measure which indicates the degree to which a
particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property. The required level
of opacity is directly related to the degree to which the potential
character of development differs between different zoning districts. The
provisions of this section indicate the minimum opacity requirements
for bufferyards located along zoning district boundaries.
D. Identification of detailed bufferyard requirements. If a proposed use
adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a

§ 510-120. Classification of plant species.
For the purpose of this chapter, plant materials are classified into the
following groupings: climax tree, tall deciduous tree, medium deciduous
tree, low deciduous tree, tall evergreen tree, medium evergreen tree, low
evergreen tree, tall deciduous shrub, medium deciduous shrub, low
deciduous shrub, medium evergreen shrub, low evergreen shrub, and
noncontributory plants. Species suitable for landscaping use and
compatible with local climate and soil factors are listed in Figure 510-120.
The Zoning Administrator shall review proposals for and the applicability of
species not contained in this list and is authorized to approve appropriate
similar species.

point, berm, and structure combinations are possible. These are listed
in Figure 510-119B.354 The requirements listed in Figure 510-119B
pertain to the number of landscaping points, the minimum bufferyard
width, and the type of berm or fencing required within every 100
feet of required bufferyard. A variety of landscaping point options
are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same
bufferyard. Section 510-115 describes the various available
landscaping point alternatives. Section 510-120 provides a listing of
tree and shrub species which correspond to the landscaping point
descriptions.

§ 510-121. Installation requirements.
A. Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the
provisions of this chapter shall be installed on the subject property, in
accordance with the approved site plan (see § 510-160), within 365
§ 510-120 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-121
1:941
days of the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the
subject property, unless a conditional use is approved to allow for
greater than 365 days.
B. If the subject property is to be occupied prior to the installation of all
required landscaping and bufferyard material, the property owner shall
sign an instrument agreeing to install the landscaping within the threehundred-
sixty-five-day period and shall furnish to the Village an
irrevocable letter of credit or other form of security acceptable to the
Village sufficient to guarantee completion of the work. Such security
shall be provided by the property owner at the time that the agreement
is signed. It shall be in an amount equal to 110% of the estimated actual
cost for all of the required elements of the approved site plan and shall
specifically guarantee that all such elements shall be made and
installed according to the approved site plan. The costs of the work
shall be furnished by the property owner and shall be verified by the
Village. The financial security shall remain in force until all of the work
has been completed and approved by the Village. This agreement shall
also contain a statement indicating that the property owner's failure to
comply with the requirements of the terms of the agreement will
constitute a violation of this chapter and subject the property owner to
a forfeiture upon conviction. If the required landscaping and bufferyard
materials are to be installed during different phases of a subdivision
development, the developer may furnish for each phase financial
security in an amount sufficient to guarantee completion of the
landscaping and bufferyard work performed during a particular phase,
unless Chapter 495, Subdivision of Land, of the Village Code requires
otherwise. If the property owner is a governmental unit, it may, in lieu
of signing an agreement and furnishing a guarantee, file a resolution or
letter from officers authorized to act in its behalf agreeing to comply
with the provisions of this article.355
C. If existing plant material meets the requirements of this article and will
be preserved on the subject property following the completion of
development, it may be counted as contributing to the landscaping
requirements.
D. All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or
native ground cover unless such vegetation is already fully established.
E. The exact placement of plants and structures shall be depicted on the
required detailed landscaping plan submitted to the Village for its
approval. Such plant and structure location shall be the decision of each
property owner, provided that the following requirements are met:
(1) Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters to maximize their
chance for survival.

§ 510-122. Maintenance requirements.
The continual maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard
materials shall be a requirement of this chapter and shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property on which said materials and
plants are required. This requirement shall run with the property and shall
be binding upon all future property owners. Development of any or all
property following the effective date of this chapter shall constitute an
agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this
section. If the property owner fails to comply with these provisions, the
Village may enter upon the property for the purpose of evaluating and
maintaining all required landscaping and bufferyard materials and may
specially assess the costs thereof against the property. A property owner's
failure to comply with this requirement shall also be considered a violation
of this chapter and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement
procedures and penalties.
§ 510-123. Use requirements.
(2) Where a combination of plant materials, berming, and fencing is
used in a bufferyard, the fence and/or berm shall be located toward
the interior of the subject property and the plant material shall be
located toward the exterior of the subject property.
(3) A property owner may establish through a written agreement,
recorded with the Register of Deeds, that an adjacent property
owner agrees to provide on the immediately adjacent portion of his
or her land a partial or full portion of the required bufferyard,
thereby relieving the developer of the responsibility of providing
the entire bufferyard on his property.
(4) Under no circumstance shall landscaping or bufferyard materials
be selected or located in a manner resulting in the creation of a
safety or visibility hazard.
(5) The restrictions on types of plants listed in this article shall apply.
A. Use of required bufferyard and landscaped areas. Any and all required
bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation
activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails,
provided that no required material is eliminated; the total width of the
required bufferyard, or the total area of required landscaping, is
maintained; and all other regulations of this chapter are met. However,
in such areas, no swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf
courses, or other such similar active recreational uses shall be
permitted. No parking and no outdoor display or storage of materials
shall be permitted. Paving in such areas shall be limited to that required
for necessary access to, through, or across the subject property.356

§ 510-124. Calculating landscaping and bufferyard requirements.
In calculating the number of required landscaping points under the
provisions of this article, all areas and distances on which required
calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number
of square feet or linear feet. Any partial plant derived from the required
calculations of this section (for example 23.3 canopy trees) shall be rounded
up to the nearest whole plant (24 canopy trees).
§ 510-125. Depiction on required site plan.
Any and all proposed landscaping on the subject property, required to meet
the standards of this chapter, shall be clearly depicted and labeled as to its
location and makeup on the site plan required for the development of the
subject property.
B. Utility easements. Landscaping materials, fences and berms located
within a duly recorded utility or a pedestrian easement shall not count
toward meeting a landscaping requirement, unless authorized
otherwise by a conditional use permit. However, the width of such areas
may be counted as part of a landscaping requirement.

§ 510-127. Applicability.
The regulations in this article apply to all signs except for the following,
which are exempt:
A. The intent of this article is to provide for and regulate the installation,
design, and safe construction of signage within the Village of East Troy
to ensure that signs are compatible with surrounding land uses, are
well maintained, and express the identity of individual proprietors and
the Village as a whole.
B. To that end, this article regulates the location, type, size, and height of
signage to protect and to promote the public health, welfare, and safety
of persons within the community; to aid in the development and
promotion of business and industry; and to ensure the implementation
of the Comprehensive Plan for the Village of East Troy. The adoption of
this article reflects the findings of fact by the Plan Commission and
Board of Trustees of the Village of East Troy that regulation of signage
has an impact on the visual environment which affects the welfare of
the residents and that reasonable control of signage can preserve and
enhance the following interests of the community at large.
(1) Promote the public health, welfare, and safety of all persons using
the public thoroughfares, and rights of way within the Village of
East Troy.
(2) Advance the aesthetic goals of the Village of East Troy throughout
the community and ensure flexibility in the creative design of
signage without detriment to adjacent property owners or the
general public.
(3) Reduce the visual clutter caused by advertising signage which the
Village considers a significant factor in obstructing visibility and
creating unsafe traffic conditions.
(4) Limit the visual impact of strip commercial development of which
signs are a primary contributor in order to be respectful of the
rights of all advertisers and business entities who display
advertising in a particular neighborhood.
C. Nothing in this article is intended to restrict or otherwise regulate the
message displayed on a sign permitted in this article.

A. Findings. The Village Board makes the following findings regarding
electronic message displays:
(1) Electronic displays are designed to produce sufficient brightness to
ensure clear legibility during daylight hours. However, daytime
brightness settings are usually inappropriate for night-time
viewing.
(2) Electronic displays that are too bright at night can be offensive and
reduce the legibility of the display copy.
(3) Technology exists to control lighting levels, with scheduled
dimming based on sunset-sunrise tables or with photocells.
(4) Appropriate standards are necessary to ensure electronic displays
do not become a nuisance to surrounding property owners or a
distraction to passing motorists.
B. General standards. When allowed by this article, an electronic message
display shall comply with the following standards:
(1) An electronic message display must be equipped with technology
the sign owner can use to program lighting levels to comply with
the lighting standards in this section.
(2) If the display is over five square feet, the message shall remain
static at least 10 seconds before the next message appears.
(3) If the display is over five square feet, no part of the message shall
give the appearance of movement, motion, or animation.
(4) If the display is over five square feet, there shall be no transition
between messages (i.e., no traveling, scrolling, dissolving, or
fading).
(5) Lighting levels shall not exceed 0.3 footcandles over ambient
lighting conditions when measured at the specified distance in the
table below, based on the size of the display. However, lighting
levels shall not exceed 0.1 footcandles over ambient lighting
conditions at the property boundary line of a residential property or
0.2 footcandles over ambient lighting conditions at the property
boundary line of a commercial, industrial, or institutional property.

ARTICLE XVII
Procedures
§ 510-150. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish procedural requirements for
zoning text amendments, Zoning Map amendments, and various
development approvals under this chapter, including conditional use
permits, temporary use permits, variances, zoning permits, occupancy
permits, sign permits, and site plan review and approval.
§ 510-151. Interpretations.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the
official interpretation of the provisions of this chapter and to describe
the required procedure for securing such interpretation.
B. Initiation of request for an interpretation. Proceedings for an
interpretation may be initiated by any of the following four methods: an
application of the owner(s) of the subject property; a recommendation
of the Plan Commission to the Village Board; by action of the Village
Board; or by request of the Zoning Administrator.
C. Application requirements. A zoning interpretation application contains
all of the following:
(1) All requests for interpretations shall clearly indicate the part of the
text of this chapter for which the interpretation is requested and
the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text.
(2) If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this
chapter to a specific property, the additional following information
shall be required:
(a) A map of the generalized location of the subject property in
relation to the Village as a whole.
(b) A map of the subject property (at a minimum scale of one inch
equals 800 feet) showing all lands for which the interpretation
is requested and all other lands within 200 feet of the
boundaries of the subject property, together with the names
and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the
same appear on the current records of the Register of Deeds.
Said map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the
subject property and its environs and the jurisdiction(s) which
maintains that control. All lot dimensions of the subject
property, a graphic scale, and a North arrow shall be provided.
(c) A written description of the reason for the requested
interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to
type of activities, buildings, and structures currently located
on, and proposed for, the subject property.
§ 510-150 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-151
1:973
(d) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for
development. Said site plan shall conform to any and all the
requirements of § 510-160.
D. Application certification. All applications for interpretations, regardless
of the party of their initiation, shall be certified as complete by the
Zoning Administrator prior to the formal initiation of this procedure. If
the Zoning Administrator determines that the application is not
complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this chapter, he shall
return a copy of the application to the applicant and indicate
incomplete or missing requirements. The application may not be placed
on any agenda as an item to be acted upon until said certification has
occurred.362
E. Review by Zoning Administrator. Within 30 days of filing of a complete
application, the Zoning Administrator shall review and evaluate the
application and prepare a written report to be forwarded to the
applicant. Said report should comment on the written justification for
the proposed interpretation, if provided by application, and shall
evaluate whether the requested interpretation relates to the
classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions
of this chapter. If so, the written report shall address the following:
(1) Whether the subject land use (in general) is in harmony with the
purposes, goals, objectives, policies, and standards of the
Comprehensive Plan, this chapter, and any other plan, program, or
ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official
notice by the Village.
(2) Whether the subject land use is in harmony with the purposes,
goals, objectives, policies, and standards of the pertinent zoning
district for which the interpretation is being sought.
(3) Whether the potential public benefits of the proposed
interpretation outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of
the proposed interpretation.
F. Standards for review. This chapter shall be interpreted in a manner
which is consistent with the purposes intended by the Village Board as
noted in this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan. The intent of the
standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both
individual property owners and the general public from adverse
impacts that may result from a proposed, modified, or existing land use.
To this end, those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as
follows:
(1) Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for
which an interpretation is required.
362. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 510-151 EAST TROY CODE § 510-151
1:974
(2) Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit
discussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was
initially imposed. Each zoning regulation is intended to protect the
interests of both present and future neighbors and the general
public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an
identifiable potential negative impact. A sound interpretation of
any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the
regulation and the end toward which it is directed. It is understood
that there may be other public purposes underlying the
interpretation which are not explicitly articulated.
(3) Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations,
permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation
that lowers the protection afforded to the public. There is a critical
distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater
degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an
interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use
or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased
beyond the degree specified in this chapter. Design freedom is to be
encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this chapter is to
be prohibited.
(4) Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just
balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will
be affected by that person's land use proposal. If an interpretation
would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from
the one expressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in the
same or greater degree of protection to any affected party (i.e., the
adjoining landowners, the public at large, and/or a future property
owner or renter), such an interpretation may be appropriately
made. Any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss
of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to
the spirit of this chapter. Similarly, any interpretation which would
either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the
purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered
counter to the legislative intent of this chapter. Any interpretation
which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity
beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party
interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional
restrictions or requirements.
(5) This chapter has been carefully designed by the Village Board to
combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection
of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property
owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the
goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Great care has
been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while
achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use
options. Persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute
their own judgments for the legislative acts of the Village Board.
§ 510-151 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-151
1:975
(6) In addition to the applicant's response to the questions required by
Subsection C above, the following standards shall govern the
decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation
matters:
(a) No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use
which was previously considered and rejected by the Village
Board on an application for an amendment to this chapter or
the Official Zoning Map or a previously applied for appeal from
a requested interpretation.
(b) No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use
permitted by right, a special use, or a conditional use in
another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in
the zoning district of the subject property (see Articles III, IV
and V).
(c) No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district
unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land
use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to
development in the subject property's zoning district (see
Articles III, IV and V).
(d) No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning
district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses
permitted in that same district and is more similar to such
other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or
permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning
district category (see Articles III, IV and V).
(e) If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted
only as a conditional use in the subject property's district than
to a use permitted by right, then an interpretation permitting
such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a
conditional use pursuant to § 510-157.
G. Review by the Plan Commission.
(1) Within 45 days after the acceptance of a complete application, the
Plan Commission shall consider the application and make its
recommendation to the Village Board.
(2) Plan Commission recommendations shall be in writing. A recording
thereof in the Plan Commission's minutes shall constitute the
required written recommendation and shall include any finding of
facts supporting its recommendation as to the whether the
potential public benefits outweigh any and all potential adverse
impacts.
H. Review and action by the Village Board. The Village Board shall
consider the recommendation of the Plan Commission regarding the
interpretation request. The Village Board may request further
§ 510-151 EAST TROY CODE § 510-151
1:976
§ 510-152. Appeals of zoning interpretations.
information and/or additional reports from the Plan Commission,
Zoning Administrator, and/or the applicant. The Village Board shall
make the final determination on the zoning interpretation.
I. Effect of a favorable land use interpretation. No interpretation finding a
particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a
specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such
use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or
moving of any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely
authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for
any permits and approvals which may be required by this chapter.
These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, required
site plans, special use permits, conditional uses, and occupancy
permits.
J. Limitations on favorable land use interpretation.

to completion, or an occupancy permit is obtained and a use
commenced within that period.
(2) An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be
deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular
location for which the interpretation was issued. The interpretation
shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for
which a separate interpretation has not been issued. A favorable
interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any

F. Fees. A fee is required with the submittal of a zoning permit application
(see § 510-149). Zoning permit fees do not include and are in addition to
building permit fees established by the Building Code. A double fee may
be charged by the Zoning Administrator if work is started before a
permit is applied for and issued. Such double fee shall not release the
applicant from full compliance with this chapter nor from prosecution
for violation of this chapter.371
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which
govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or
denial, of proposed conditional uses. (Refer to the requirements of
§ 62.23, Wis. Stats.) Under this chapter, a proposed conditional use

II).
§ 510-156 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-157
1:989
shall be denied unless the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Village that the proposed conditional use will not create
undesirable impacts on nearby properties, the environment, or the
community as a whole.
B. Applicability. The execution of this chapter is based upon the division of
the Village into zoning districts, within which districts the use of land
and buildings and bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are mutually compatible and substantially uniform.
However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique
characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted
uses in any particular district or districts without consideration of the
impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities and the
public need for a particular use in a particular location. In these
instances, the conditional use permit review and approval procedures
shall apply.
C. Review and approval. All conditional use permit requests shall be
subject to the review of the Zoning Administrator. The Plan Commission
shall review, hear, and submit its recommendation to the Village Board,
which shall act on the conditional use permit request in accordance
with the procedures in this section.
D. Limited conditional use. Limited conditional uses are those in which the
Village Board has found that any of the following should be of lesser
permanence than regular conditional uses, and the duration or term of
existence may be established until a time certain or be limited to a
future happening or event at which time the same shall terminate:
(1) Their particularly specialized nature.
(2) Their particular locations within a district.
(3) The peculiar unique relationships or needed compatibility of uses
to involved individuals.
(4) Any other reason(s) the Village Board deems specially relevant and
material to delimit the scope thereof.
E. Initiation of request for approval of a conditional use. Proceedings for
approval of a conditional use may be initiated by an application of the
owner(s) of the subject property.
F. Application requirements. An application for a conditional use permit
shall contain the following:
(1) A map of the generalized location of the subject property in relation
to the Village as a whole.
(2) A map of the subject property (at a minimum scale of one inch
equals 800 feet) showing all lands for which the conditional use is
proposed and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of
the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the
§ 510-157 EAST TROY CODE § 510-157
1:990
owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current
records of the Register of Deeds. Said map shall clearly indicate
the current zoning of the subject property and its environs and the
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. All lot dimensions of
the subject property, a graphic scale, and a North arrow shall be
provided.
(3) A written description of the proposed conditional use describing
the type of activities, buildings, and structures proposed for the
subject property and their general locations.
(4) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development.
Said site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of
§ 510-160. If the proposed conditional use is a group development
(per § 510-108) or a large development (per § 510-109), a proposed
preliminary plat or conceptual plat may be substituted for the
required site plan, provided that said plat contains all information
required on said site plan.
(5) As an optional requirement, the applicant may provide written
justification for the proposed conditional use consisting of the
reasons why the applicant believes the proposed conditional use is
appropriate.
G. Application certification. All applications for proposed conditional uses
shall be certified as complete by the Zoning Administrator a minimum
of two weeks prior to the initiation of this procedure. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application does not fulfill the
requirements of this chapter, he shall return a copy of the application to
the applicant and indicate incomplete or missing requirements.372
H. Review by Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall review
and evaluate the application and prepare a written report to be
forwarded to the Plan Commission for review and recommendation to
the Village Board. Through the written report, the Zoning
Administrator shall evaluate whether:
(1) The proposed conditional use (the use in general, independent of
its location) is in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives,
policies and standards of the Comprehensive Plan, this chapter, and
any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted or under
consideration pursuant to official notice by the Village. If the
Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed use,
independent of its location, may be in conflict with the provisions of
the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall note this
determination in the report.
(2) The proposed conditional use (in its specific location) is in harmony
with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the
372. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 510-157 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-157
1:991
Comprehensive Plan, this chapter, and any other plan, program,
or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official
notice by the Village. If the Zoning Administrator determines that
the proposed use, in its specific location, may be in conflict with the
provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator
shall note this determination in the report.
(3) The proposed conditional use, in its proposed location and as
depicted on the required site plan, results in a substantial or undue
adverse impact on nearby property, the character of the
neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking,
public improvements, public property or rights-of-way, or other
matters affecting the public health, safety, or general welfare,
either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed
as a result of the implementation of the provisions of this chapter,
the Comprehensive Plan, or any other plan, program, map, or
ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official
notice by the Village or other governmental agency having
jurisdiction to guide development.
(4) The proposed conditional use would maintain the desired
consistency of land uses, land use intensities, and land use impacts
as related to the environs of the subject property.
(5) The proposed conditional use is located in an area that will be
adequately served by, and will not impose an undue burden on, any
of the improvements, facilities, utilities or services provided by
public agencies serving the subject property.
(6) The potential public benefits of the proposed conditional use
outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed
conditional use after taking into consideration the applicant's
proposal and any requirements recommended by the applicant to
ameliorate such impacts.
I. Review and public hearing by the Plan Commission.
(1) Within 45 days after acceptance of a complete application, the Plan
Commission shall conduct a public hearing to consider the
application. The applicant may appear in person or by agent and/or
by attorney.
(2) Notice of the requested conditional use permit and the public
hearing shall conform to the requirements of § 62.23(7)(d), Wis.
Stats. Said notice shall contain a description of the subject property
and the proposed conditional use. At least 10 days before said
public hearing, the Village Clerk shall mail a notice to the
applicant; to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are
within 1,000 feet of any portion of the jurisdiction of this chapter;
and, if the requested conditional use permit would make any
change within three miles of the boundaries of an airport, to the
operator of said airport. Failure to mail said notice or failure to
§ 510-157 EAST TROY CODE § 510-157
1:992
meet the time requirements herein, provided that it is
unintentional, shall not invalidate proceedings under this section.
[Amended 12-16-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-18]
(3) Plan Commission recommendations shall be in writing. A recording
thereof in the Plan Commission's minutes shall constitute the
required written recommendation and shall include any finding of
facts supporting its recommendation as to the whether the
potential public benefits outweigh any and all potential adverse
impacts.
(4) If the Plan Commission does not provide a recommendation to the
Village Board within 60 days after the filing of a complete
application, the Village Board may then hold a public hearing
within 30 days after the expiration of said sixty-day period. Failure
to receive said recommendations from the Plan Commission shall
not invalidate the proceedings or actions of the Village Board. If
such a public hearing is necessary, the Village Board shall provide
notice per the requirements of Subsection I(2) above.
J. Review and action by Village Board. The Village Board shall consider
the recommendation of the Plan Commission regarding the proposed
conditional use. The Village Board may request further information and/
or additional reports from the Plan Commission, Zoning Administrator,
applicant, and/or from any other source.
(1) The Village Board may take final action (by resolution) on the
application at the time of its initial meeting or may continue the
proceedings at the applicant's request. The Village Board may
approve the conditional use as originally proposed, may approve
the proposed conditional use with modifications, or may deny
approval of the proposed conditional use.
(2) If the Village Board wishes to make significant changes in the
proposed conditional use, as recommended by the Plan
Commission, then the procedure set forth in § 62.23(7)(d), Wis.
Stats., shall be followed prior to Village Board action. Any action to
amend the provisions of a proposed conditional use requires a
majority vote of the Village Board. Village Board approval of the
conditional use shall be considered the approval of a unique
request and shall not be construed as precedent for any other
proposed conditional use.
K. Effect of denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or
in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of
said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
L. Termination of an approved conditional use. Upon approval by the
Village Board, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed
conditional use meets all general and specific conditional use
§ 510-157 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-157
1:993
requirements in the site plan required for initiation of development
activity on the subject property per § 510-160. Once a conditional use
is granted, no erosion control permit, site plan, occupancy permit,
or building permit shall be issued for any development which does
not comply with all requirements of this chapter. Any conditional use
found not to be in compliance with the terms of this chapter shall
be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to all
applicable procedures and penalties. A conditional use may be revoked
for such a violation by majority vote of the Village Board, following the
procedures outlined in Subsection J above.
M. Time limits on the development of conditional use. The start of
construction of any and all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365
days of their approval by the Village Board and they shall be operational
within 730 days of said approval. Failure to initiate development within
this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional
use. For the purposes of this section, "operational" shall be defined as
the granting of an occupancy permit for the conditional use. Prior to
such a revocation, the applicant may request an extension of this
period. Said request shall require formal approval by the Village Board
and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as
determined by the Village Board).
N. Discontinuing an approved conditional use. Any and all conditional uses
which have been discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall
have their conditional use invalidated automatically. The burden of
proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that
the subject conditional use was operational during this period.
O. Change of ownership. All requirements of the approved conditional use
shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property;
however, submittal of a plan of operation shall be required prior to the
change in ownership. For bed-and-breakfast establishments, the
granting of a conditional use permit shall be valid while said property is
owned by the owner at time of conditional use approval.
P. Modification, alteration or expansion. Modification, alteration, or
expansion of any conditional use without approval by the Village Board
shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be grounds for
revocation of said conditional use approval per Subsection J above.
Q. Recording of conditional use requirements. Except for conditional use
approvals for temporary uses, a certified copy of the authorizing
resolution, containing identifiable description and any specific
requirements of approval, shall be recorded by the Village with the
Register of Deeds.
R. Notice to the WisDNR. The Plan Commission shall transmit a copy of
each application for a conditional use for conservancy regulations in the
Floodplain or Shoreland-Wetland Overlay Zoning Districts to the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WisDNR) for review and
§ 510-157 EAST TROY CODE § 510-157
1:994
§ 510-158. Temporary use permit procedures.
comment at least 10 days prior to any public hearings. Final action
on the application shall not be taken for 30 days or until the WisDNR
has made its recommendation, whichever comes first. A copy of all
decisions relating to conditional uses for shoreland-wetland
conservancy regulations or to floodland regulations shall be
transmitted to the WisDNR within 10 days of the date of such decision.
S. Formerly approved conditional uses. A use now regulated as a
conditional use which was approved as a legal land use, either
permitted by right or as a conditional use, prior to the effective date of
this chapter shall be considered as a legal, conforming land use so long
as the previously approved conditions of use and site plan are followed.
Any modification of the previously approved conditions of use or site
plan shall require application and Village consideration under this
section.
T. Fees. One or more fees are required for this procedure. Refer to
§ 510-149.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations that
govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or
denial, of proposed temporary use permits.
B. Applicability. Temporary uses are those uses that have the potential to
create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop
simply under the general requirements of this chapter. Temporary uses
also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby
properties that potentially cannot be determined except on a case-bycase
basis. In order to prevent this from occurring, all temporary uses
are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only
to temporary uses, in addition to the general requirements of this
chapter and the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject
property is located.
C. Review and approval. All temporary use permit requests shall be
subject to the review of and issued by the Zoning Administrator.
D. Application requirements. Applications for proposed temporary uses
shall contain all of the following:
(1) A map of the generalized location of the subject property in relation
to the Village as a whole.
(2) A map of the subject property (at a minimum scale of one inch
equals 800 feet) showing all lands for which the temporary use is
proposed and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of
the subject property. Said map shall clearly indicate the current
zoning of the subject property and its environs and the
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. All lot dimensions of

Refer to § 510-141 for applicable requirements for sign permits.
§ 510-160. Site plan review and approval procedures.
the subject property, a graphic scale, and a North arrow shall be
provided.
(3) A written description of the proposed temporary use describing the
type of activities, buildings, and structures proposed for the subject
property and their general locations.
(4) Demonstration that the proposed temporary use meets all
temporary use requirements of this chapter (see Article VI).
(5) The Zoning Administrator may also require a site plan of the
subject property. Said site plan shall conform to any and all the
requirements of § 510-160.
E. Violation. Any temporary use found not to be in compliance with the
terms of this chapter shall be considered in violation of this chapter and
shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.
F. Fee. A fee may be required for this procedure. Refer to § 510-149.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to specify the requirements and
procedures for the review and approval of site plan applications. The
provisions of this section are designed to ensure that proposed land
uses and development activity comply with the requirements of this
chapter. Specifically, this section requires all development activity (i.e.,
building permits, zoning permits, and occupancy permits) to first obtain
the approval of site, building, and operational plans by the Plan
Commission before the building, occupancy, and zoning permits can be
issued, except that development activity associated with an approved
final plat of subdivision or certified survey map, and development
activity associated with an approved final development plan of a
planned development, is exempt from this requirement.373
B. Applicability. All land uses listed in Article VI are subject to site plan
review and approval except for the following:
(1) Single-family and two-family residential uses on individual lots in
any zoning district.
(2) Agricultural land uses which are permitted by right in any
agricultural zoning district.
(3) Uses within a final development plan in a planned development in
accordance with the procedures of Article XII, provided that the

II).
§ 510-158 EAST TROY CODE § 510-160
1:996
final development plan provides a similar level of detail and range
of plans as a typical site plan submittal required under this chapter.
C. Review and approval. All site plans shall be subject to the review of the
Zoning Administrator. The Plan Commission shall review and act on the
site plan in accordance with the procedures in this section.
D. Initiation of request for site plan approval. Proceedings for approval of
a site plan shall be initiated by the owner(s) of the subject property or
his legally authorized representative(s). The applicant shall meet with
the Zoning Administrator and other applicable Village staff for a
preapplication meeting to discuss preliminary concepts and plans for
the development. Guidance will be provided to the applicant on
technical requirements and procedures, and a timetable for project
review may be discussed.
E. Application for site plan review. A site plan application may be
considered complete if it contains all of the following, unless specific
application requirements are waived in writing by the Village Clerk,
Village Engineer, Village Planner, or the Zoning Administrator:

§ 510-160 EAST TROY CODE § 510-160
1:1000
(a) Topographic information is not required for any property which
does not contain steep slopes. For such properties, topographic
information with a minimum contour interval of two feet is
required.
(b) All natural resource areas which require protection under the
provisions of this chapter shall be accurately outlined and
clearly labeled. Particular care as to clarity shall be taken in
areas where different resource types overlap with one another.
(c) All site disruption (including selective cutting) proposed to
occur within permanently protected natural resource areas
shall be limited to development pads. Development pads shall
be depicted on the detailed site analysis map, site plans
required for development permits, and the recorded plat of
subdivision or certified survey map.
(d) Beyond visible damage to natural resources, vegetation, soil,
and drainage patterns, site disruption activities shall not
compact soil covering tree roots or otherwise damage trees
beyond the area from which trees are to be removed. All trees
with calipers exceeding three inches, whose canopies are
located adjacent to disturbed areas, which are removed within
a period of five years following site disruption shall be replaced
by the owner with a three-inch caliper tree of the same type
(canopy or understory).378
(e) All mitigation areas related to the provisions of this chapter
shall be depicted on the detailed site map with notations
provided which describe the mitigation techniques employed.
(2) The detailed site analysis map shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator for initial review prior to, or concurrently with, the
submission of the preliminary plat of subdivision or the certified
survey map, or if the proposed development does not involve a land
division, then submittal is required as an attachment to a required
site plan. A concept plan of the proposed development may be
submitted prior to the submission of the detailed site analysis map;
however, in no way does the acceptance and/or general approval of
a concept plan indicate the approval of natural resource feature
locations. A detailed site analysis map prepared for the subject
property which has been previously approved by Village staff may
be submitted for any subsequent development activity on the site.
However, modifications to such a previously approved map will be
required if the analysis is no longer accurate for the subject
property.
(3) Village staff shall review the submitted detailed site analysis map
for general compliance with the data sources listed under
378. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.

(f) Applicable federal and state wetland inventory maps.
(g) The Village of East Troy Comprehensive Plan.
(h) Site visits.
(4) If necessary, as determined by Village staff, revised detailed site
analysis maps shall be prepared and submitted for review by
Village staff until a version is deemed acceptable. Staff review of
the detailed site analysis may be appealed as a matter of
interpretation (see § 510-152).
(5) Upon notification of acceptance by Village staff (or, in case of
appeal, by determination of the Zoning Board of Appeals), the
petitioner may proceed with the submittal of necessary
development documents.
(6) Information contained on the detailed site analysis map relating to
the boundaries of permanently protected green space areas
(including natural resource protection areas, other permanently
protected green space areas, and required mitigation areas) shall
be clearly depicted on any and all site plans required as a
precondition for application for any development permit (such as a
building permit) and on any proposed plat of subdivision or
certified survey map.
H. Site plan review by the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission, in its
consideration of a site plan, shall take into account the basic intent of
this chapter to ensure attractive, efficient, and appropriate
development of land in the community and to ensure that every
reasonable step has been taken to avoid depreciating effects on
surrounding property and the natural environment. The Plan
Commission may require such additional measures and/or
§ 510-160 EAST TROY CODE § 510-160
1:1002
modifications as it deems necessary to accomplish this objective and
may withhold approval of the site plan until revisions depicting such
additional measures and/or modifications are submitted to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission. Amended plans and conditions
applicable to the proposed use shall be made a part of the official
record, and development activity on the subject property may not
proceed until the revised application has been approved by the Plan
Commission. In its review of the site plan application, the Plan
Commission may make findings on each of the following criteria to
determine whether the submitted site plan shall be approved, approved
with modification, or denied:
(1) All standards of this chapter and other applicable Village, state,
and federal regulations are met.
(2) The public health and safety are not endangered.
(3) Adequate public facilities and utilities are provided.
(4) Adequate control of stormwater and erosion is provided and the
disruption of existing topography, drainage patterns, and
vegetative cover is minimized insofar as is practical.379
(5) Appropriate traffic control and parking are provided.
(6) Appropriate landscaping and open space areas are provided.
(7) The appearance of structures maintains a consistency of design,
materials, colors, and arrangement with nearby properties of
similar use which complies with the general architectural
guidelines provided in Subsection H(7)(a) through (e) below:
(a) Exterior construction materials shall be consistent with
§ 510-90.
(b) Exterior building design or appearance shall not be of such
unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to its
surroundings as to be unsightly or offensive to generally
accepted taste and community standards.
(c) Exterior building design or appearance shall not be so identical
with nearby buildings so as to create excessive monotony or
drabness. A minimum of five basic home styles shall be
provided in each residential subdivision.
(d) Exterior building design or appearance shall not be
constructed or faced with an exterior material which is
aesthetically incompatible with other nearby buildings or
which presents an unattractive appearance to the public and to
surrounding properties.

II).
§ 510-160 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-160
1:1003
§ 510-161. Variance review and approval procedures.
(e) Exterior building, sign, and lighting design or appearance shall
not be sited on the property in a manner which would
unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the natural
beauty of the area.
I. Initiation of land use or development activity. Except with the written
permission of the Zoning Administrator, absolutely no land use or
development activity, including site clearing, grubbing, or grading,
shall occur on the subject property prior to the approval of the required
site plan. Any such activity prior to such approval shall be a violation of
this chapter and shall be subject to all applicable enforcement
mechanisms and penalties.
J. Modification of an approved site plan. Any and all variation between
development and/or land use activity on the subject property and the
approved site plan is a violation of this chapter. An approved site plan
shall be revised and approved via the procedures of this section so as to
clearly and completely depict any and all proposed modifications to the
previously approved site plan, prior to the initiation of said
modifications.
K. Sunset clause. If all buildings on an approved site plan are not fully
developed within two years of final Plan Commission approval, then the
approval shall expire, and no additional site plan development shall be
permitted on undeveloped portions of the subject property. The Plan
Commission may extend this period, as requested by the applicant,
through the site review process.380
L. Fee. A fee may be required for this procedure. Refer to § 510-149.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which
enable the Village to hear and decide requests for permitted variation
from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest, where, owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice
done, as provided for by § 62.23(7)(e)7, Wis. Stats.
B. Applicability. In special circumstances where the provisions of this
chapter deprive a particular property, because of special circumstances
applicable to the property, of privileges commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the vicinity or the same zoning district, a variance may be
requested.
C. Review and approval. All variance requests shall be subject to the
review of the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
380. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 510-160 EAST TROY CODE § 510-161
1:1004
review and act on all variance requests in accordance with the
procedures in this section.
D. Initiation of request for approval of a variance. Proceedings for
approval of a requested variance shall be initiated by an application of
the owner(s) or his authorized agent of the subject property.
E. Application requirements. Variance applications shall contain the
following:
(1) A map of the generalized location of the subject property in relation
to the Village as a whole.
(2) A map of the subject property (at a minimum scale of one inch
equals 800 feet) showing all lands for which the variance is
proposed and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of
the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the
owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current
records of the Register of Deeds. Said map shall clearly indicate the
current zoning of the subject property and its environs and the
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. All lot dimensions of
the subject property, a graphic scale, and a North arrow shall be
provided.
(3) A written description of the proposed variance describing the type
of specific requirements of the variance proposed for the subject
property.
(4) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development.
Said site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of
§ 510-160.
(5) Written justification for the requested variance consisting of the
reasons why the applicant believes the proposed variance is
appropriate.
F. Application certification. All applications for requested variances shall
be certified as complete by the Zoning Administrator a minimum of two
weeks prior to the initiation of this procedure. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application is not complete or does
not fulfill the requirements of this chapter, he shall return a copy of the
application to the applicant and indicate incomplete or missing
requirements.381
G. Review by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
review and evaluate the application and prepare a written report to be
forwarded to the Zoning Board of Appeals for review and action. If the
Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict
with the provisions of this chapter or the Comprehensive Plan, the
381. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 510-161 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-161
1:1005
Zoning Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
Through the written report, the Zoning Administrator shall evaluate to
following:
(1) Whether exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or special
factors are present that apply only to the subject property. The
report shall clearly indicate how the subject property contains
factors which are not present on other properties in the same
zoning district. Specifically:
(a) The hardship or difficulty shall be peculiar to the subject
property and different from that of other properties and not
one which affects all properties similarly. Such a hardship or
difficulty shall have arisen because of the unusual shape of the
original acreage parcel; unusual topography or elevation; or
because the property was created before the passage of the
current, applicable zoning regulations, and is not economically
suitable for a permitted use or will not accommodate a
structure of reasonable design for a permitted use if all area,
yard, green space, and setback requirements are observed.
(b) Loss of profit or pecuniary hardship shall not, in and of itself,
be grounds for a variance.
(c) Self-imposed hardship shall not be grounds for a variance.
Reductions resulting from the sale of portions of a property
reducing the remainder of said property below buildable size
or cutting off existing access to a public right-of-way or deed
restrictions imposed by the owner's predecessor in title are
considered to be such self-imposed hardships.
(d) Violations by, or variances granted to, neighboring properties
shall not justify a variance.
(e) The alleged hardship shall not be one that would have existed
in the absence of a zoning ordinance; for example, if a lot were
unbuildable because of topography in the absence of any or all
setback requirements.
(2) In what manner the factors identified above prohibit the
development of the subject property in a manner similar to that of
other properties under the same zoning district. The report shall
clearly indicate how the requested variance is essential to make the
subject property developable so that property rights enjoyed by the
owners of similar properties can be enjoyed by the owners of the
subject property.
(3) Whether the granting of the proposed variance would be of
substantial detriment to adjacent properties. The report shall
clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial
impact on adjacent properties.
§ 510-161 EAST TROY CODE § 510-161
1:1006
(4) Whether the granting of the proposed variance as depicted on the
required site plan would result in a substantial or undue adverse
impact on the character of the neighborhood, environmental
factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public
property or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public
health, safety, or general welfare, either as they now exist or as
they may in the future be developed as a result of the
implementation of the intent, provisions, and policies of this
chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, or any other plan, program, map,
or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official
notice by the Village or other governmental agency having
jurisdiction to guide growth and development. The report shall
clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial
impact on such long-range planning matters.
(5) Whether the factors which present the reason for the proposed
variance have been created by the act of the applicant or previous
property owner or his agent (for example: previous development
decisions such as building placement, floor plan or orientation, lot
pattern, or grading) after the effective date of this chapter. The
report shall clearly indicate that such factors existed prior to the
effective date of this chapter and were not created by action of the
applicant, a previous property owner, or his agent.
(6) Whether the proposed variance involves the regulations of Article
VI. The report shall clearly indicate that the requested variance
does not involve the provisions of this article.
H. Review, public hearing and determination by Zoning Board of
Appeals.382
(1) Within 30 days after filing of the complete application, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing.
(2) Notice of the requested variance and the public hearing shall
conform to the requirements of § 62.23(7)(d), Wis. Stats. Said
notice shall contain a description of the subject property and the
proposed variance. At least 10 days before said public hearing, the
Village shall mail a notice of the proposed variance to the applicant;
to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000
feet of any portion of the subject property; to all property owners
within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property; and, if the
proposed variance would make any change within three miles of
the boundaries of an airport, to the operator of said airport. Failure
to mail said notice, provided that it is unintentional, shall not
invalidate proceedings under this section.
(3) Within 30 days after the holding of the public hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall make its findings per Subsection G above
382. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 510-161 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-161
1:1007
§ 510-162. Occupancy permits.
and its determination regarding the application as a whole. The
Zoning Board of Appeals may request further information and/
or additional reports from the Zoning Administrator and/or the
applicant. The Zoning Board of Appeals may take final action on
said request for approval of the requested variance at the time
of its initial meeting or said proceedings may be continued from
time to time for further consideration. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall make a written report of its findings and determinations
following its determination.
I. Effect of denial. No application for a variance which has been denied
(either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months
from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence
or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
J. Limited effect of a variance. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has
granted a variance, such approval shall neither change the use
classification of the building or premises nor give it any status as a
nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the
variance. Granting of a variance shall be considered as unique to the
variance granted and shall not be construed as precedent for any other
proposed variance.
K. Stay of proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal
proceedings furthering enforcement of any provisions of this chapter
from which the applicant is requesting a variance, unless the Zoning
Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the request
for the variance has been filed that, by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning
Administrator, and on due cause shown. State law reference:
§ 62.23(7)(e)5, Wis. Stats.
L. Notice to the WisDNR. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit a
copy of each application for a variance in the Floodplain or Shoreland-
Wetland Overlay Zoning District and a copy of all floodplain or
shoreland-wetland appeals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (WisDNR) for review and comment at least 10 days prior to
any public hearing. Final action on the application shall not be taken for
30 days or until the WisDNR has made its recommendation, whichever
comes first. A copy of all decisions relating to variances to floodplain or
shoreland-wetland regulations, and a copy of all decisions on floodplain
or shoreland-wetland appeals, shall be transmitted to the WisDNR
within 10 days of the date of such decision.
M. Fee. A fee may be required for this procedure. Refer to § 510-149.
§ 510-161 EAST TROY CODE § 510-162
1:1008
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations governing
the review and approval of occupancy permits. This procedure is
required to ensure completed development complies with the approved
site plan (per the requirements of § 510-160) and the requirements of
this chapter.
B. Applicability. Occupancy permits shall be required for any of the
following:
(1) Occupancy and use of a building or structure hereafter erected or
structurally altered.
(2) New occupancy and use of an existing building when the new use is
of a different land use classification.
(3) Occupancy and use of vacant land.
(4) New use of vacant land when the new use is of a different land use
classification.
(5) Any change in the tenant or use of a nonconforming use. No change
of tenant or use shall take place until an occupancy permit has
been issued by the Building Inspector. [Amended 10-17-2011]
C. Review and approval. All occupancy permits shall be subject to the
review of and issued by the Building Inspector. [Amended 6-15-2015
by Ord. No. 2015-02]
D. Issuance of occupancy permit.
(1) Every application for a building permit shall also be deemed to be
an application for an occupancy permit for a new building or for an
existing building which is to be substantially altered or enlarged as
determined by the Building Inspector. Such occupancy permit shall
be issued within 10 working days after a written request for the
same has been made to the Building Inspector after the erection or
alteration of such building or part thereof has been completed in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter. [Amended
6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-02]
(2) Written application for an occupancy permit for the use of vacant
land or for a change in the use of land or of a building, or for a
change in a nonconforming use, as herein provided, shall be made
to the Building Inspector; if the proposed use is in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter, the occupancy permit shall be issued
within 10 working days after the application has been made.
(3) Every occupancy permit shall state that both the building and the
proposed use of a building or land substantially comply with all
provisions of this chapter. A record of all occupancy permits shall
be kept on file in the office of the Building Inspector and copies
shall be furnished on request to any person having proprietary or
tenancy interest in the building or land affected.

1:1009
§ 510-162.1. Registration of a legal nonconforming use. [Added
5-20-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-04]
E. Termination of occupancy permit. It shall constitute a violation of this
chapter for any person, firm, corporation, or voluntary association,
either owner or agent, to do any of the things mentioned in Subsection
B above without having first obtained an occupancy permit. Any permit
issued upon a false statement of any fact which is material to the
issuance thereof shall be void. Whenever the fact of such false
statement shall be established to the satisfaction of the Building
Inspector, he shall forthwith revoke the occupancy permit by written
notice to be delivered by him to the holder of the void permit upon the
premises where the violation has occurred or, if such holder is not found
there, by mailing said notice of revocation by certified letter to his last
known address. Any person who shall proceed thereafter with such
work or use without having obtained a new occupancy permit shall be
deemed guilty of a violation of this chapter.
F. Fee. A fee may be required for this procedure. Refer to § 510-149.
A. Generally. There may be now or in the future certain uses of land that
are not in compliance with this chapter, but which were legally
established. These uses are referred to as "legal nonconforming uses,"
and consistent with the provisions of Article IX are allowed to continue
to operate. For this reason, it is necessary to document those uses that
are considered legal nonconforming. Registration of a use as a legal
nonconforming use establishes (1) when the use was first established;
(2) that the use at the time of establishment complied with the Village's
zoning regulations in effect at the time, if any; (3) that the use has
continued continuously, without cessation of more than 12 continuous
months; and (4) the nature of the use when the use became
nonconforming. The procedures and requirements in this section are
intended to comply with § 60.61(5)(d), Wis. Stats.
B. Initiation. Any of the following may submit an application to register a
specific land use as a legal nonconforming use:
(1) A person having a financial interest in the subject property or in the
use occurring on the property;
(2) The Zoning Administrator;
(3) The Plan Commission; or
(4) The Village Board, or any member thereof.
C. Review procedure. The general steps outlined below shall be used in
the review of an application for the registration of a legal
nonconforming use.
(1) Submittal of application materials. The applicant submits a
completed application and other required materials to the Zoning
§ 510-162 EAST TROY CODE § 510-162.1
1:1010
Administrator along with the application fee as may be established
by the Village Board.
(2) Determination of completeness. The Zoning Administrator will
review the submittal within 10 days of receiving the application and
other required materials to make sure it is complete and ready for
further review. If it is not complete, the Zoning Administrator will
notify the applicant in writing of such deficiencies and that the
applicant has three months from the date of the notice to resubmit
the application or forfeit the application fee. The Zoning
Administrator may not take any further steps to process the
application until the deficiencies are remedied. The incomplete
application must be retained as a public record.
(3) Review date. When the Zoning Administrator determines the
application is complete, he or she will schedule the review with the
Plan Commission consistent with its meeting calendar allowing for
proper notice.
(4) Public hearing notice. The Zoning Administrator will publish a class
II public hearing notice.
(5) Notice to property owner. If the applicant is not the property owner,
the Zoning Administrator will send a notice to the property owner
at least two weeks in advance of the public hearing.
(6) Plan Commission meeting. Allowing for proper notice, the Plan
Commission will consider the application at a regular or special
meeting.
(7) Recommendation. The Plan Commission will make a
recommendation to the Village Board as set forth in this section.
The Plan Commission may render its decision at the same meeting
the matter was initially considered or at a subsequent meeting, but
no later than 40 days after the date of the initial meeting unless the
applicant agrees to an extension of a specified duration.
(8) Village Board meeting. Allowing for proper notice, the Village
Board will consider the application at a regular or special meeting.
(9) Decision. After considering the Plan Commission's
recommendation, the Village Board will make a final decision as set
forth in this section.
(10) Preparation of decision notice. Based on the action of the Village
Board, the Zoning Administrator will prepare a written decision
notice consistent with this section.
(11) Applicant/property owner notification. Within a reasonable time
following the Village Board's decision, the Zoning Administrator
will provide a copy of the decision notice to the Village Board, Plan
§ 510-162.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-162.1
1:1011
Commission, and others as may be appropriate. The original will be
mailed to the property owner by regular mail.
(12) Public record copy. A copy of the decision notice will be retained as
a public record.
(13) Inclusion in registry. If the application is approved, the Zoning
Administrator will include the legal nonconforming use in the
registry authorized in § 510-64A.
D. Basis of decision.
(1) A legal nonconforming use must meet each of the following:
(a) The use was legally established;
(b) The use as it existed when it became nonconforming is not
allowed in the zoning district in which it is now located either
by right or as a conditional use; and
(c) The use has continued from the date when it became
nonconforming to the current date without an interruption of
more than 12 continuous months.
(2) If it is not possible to clearly establish the exact date when the use
was legally established, the Village Board may prescribe a date that
will be deemed to be the date of establishment if it determines it is
reasonable to do so based on the information it has reviewed.
Similarly, if it is not possible to clearly establish the precise nature
of the use on the date it became nonconforming, the Village Board
may establish the nature of the use in its decision notice, if it
determines it is reasonable to do so based on the information it has
reviewed.
E. Application form and content.
(1) The application submittal must include an application form as used
by the Village and a scaled drawing of the subject property and the
location of the land use on the property. At a minimum, the
application form should request the following information:
(a) The date, or approximate date, the use was first established or
believed to be first established;
(b) Evidence showing that the use at the time of establishment was
legally established;
(c) The date, or approximate date, when the use became
nonconforming;
(d) The section of the zoning regulation causing the use to be
nonconforming;
§ 510-162.1 EAST TROY CODE § 510-162.1
1:1012
(e) Evidence showing that the use has continued from the date, or
approximate date, of establishment to the current date without
an interruption of more than 12 continuous months; and
(f) The nature of the use and location on the subject property.
(2) Sources of such information may be derived from any of the
following:
(a) Written document (e.g., business license, meeting minutes,
reports, planning documents, or a permit or other
authorization) maintained by a local, state, or federal
governmental body;
(b) A newspaper article;
(c) A dated photograph;
(d) An aerial photograph;
(e) A sworn affidavit supplied by the applicant or any other person;
or
(f) Any other authoritative source deemed acceptable by the
Village Board.
F. Content of decision notice for approval. If the application for
registering a legal nonconforming use is approved, the decision notice
should include the following:
(1) The date the use was first established;
(2) The date the use became nonconforming;
(3) A description of the use, including the scope of the use, its location,
and any operating characteristics, when the use became
nonconforming;
(4) If the Village Board determines the use has been illegally expanded
over time (i.e., location, area, extent, mode of operation, or other
parameter), a statement describing those aspects of the existing
use that must be removed consistent with an established timeline;
(5) A statement that the applicant or other party may appeal the
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction;
(6) Other information the Village Board or Zoning Administrator
deems appropriate;
(7) The signature of the Zoning Administrator on behalf of the Village
Board; and
(8) The date of the decision.
§ 510-162.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-162.1
1:1013
§ 510-162.2. Registry of legal nonconforming lots, structures,
signs, and uses. [Added 5-20-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-04]
G. Content of decision notice for denial. If the application for registering a
nonconforming use is denied, the decision notice should include the
following:
(1) A statement that the use cannot be classified as a legal
nonconforming use based on the information that was reviewed;
(2) A description of the use;
(3) A reason for the decision;
(4) A statement indicating that the denial does not limit the applicant's
ability to resubmit a revised application for consideration;
(5) A statement that the applicant may appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction;
(6) Other information the Village Board or Zoning Administrator
deems appropriate;
(7) The signature of the Zoning Administrator on behalf of the Village
Board; and
(8) The date of the decision notice.
H. Effect of decision.
(1) Generally. If the Village Board determines that a land use meets the
criteria for a legal nonconforming use, such decision constitutes
documentary evidence establishing the legitimacy of the use as a
legal nonconforming use.
(2) Expansion not authorized. If a land use was legally established, but
has been illegally expanded over time (i.e., area, extent, mode of
operation, or other parameter) after the date the use became
nonconforming, such expansion must be removed in keeping with a
timeline established by the Village Board.
I. Revocation or modification of a prior approval. The Village Board may
revoke or modify a final decision made pursuant to this section if it is
determined that (i) information the Board relied upon in making its
decision was false, misleading, or inaccurate; (ii) new or additional
information shows the use does not qualify as a legal nonconforming
use; or (iii) the section of the zoning code creating the nonconforming
use no longer exists.
J. Appeal. An aggrieved person may file an appeal with a court of
competent jurisdiction within 30 days of the date of the Village's final
decision notice.
§ 510-162.1 EAST TROY CODE § 510-162.2

A. Content of registry. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to develop
and maintain a registry of:
(1) Lots known by him or her to be considered legal nonconforming;
(2) Structures known by him or her to be considered legal
nonconforming;
(3) Signs known by him or her to be considered legal nonconforming;
and
(4) Land uses registered as a legal nonconforming use consistent with
the requirements in § 510-162A of this chapter.
B. Form of registry. At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the
registry may consist of either a written list or digital records.
C. Disclaimer. Given the nature of the registry, the Village does not
warrant that such information is complete and/or accurate in all

ARTICLE XVIII
Floodplain Overlay District
[Added 8-18-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-09]
§ 510-163. Statutory authorization.
This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23,
Wis. Stats., and the requirements in § 87.30, Wis. Stats.
§ 510-164. Finding of fact.
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare, and tax base.
§ 510-165. Statement of purpose.
This article is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
§ 510-166. Areas to be regulated.
This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood
or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other
maps approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Base
flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other
regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO Zones. Regional flood elevations
(RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision
is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
A. Protect life, health and property;
B. Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood-control projects;
C. Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
D. Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
F. Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
G. Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;
H. Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and
result in conflicts between property owners; and
I. Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the
floodplain.

1:1017
§ 510-167. Official maps and revisions. [Amended 12-16-2019 by
Ord. No. 2019-18]
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO
or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed
below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to
the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and FEMA through the letter
of map change process (see § 510-191) before it is effective. No changes
to regional flood elevations on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until
approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. These maps
and revisions are on file in the office of the Village Clerk. If more than one
map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
§ 510-168. Establishment of floodplain zoning districts.
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
§ 510-169. Locating floodplain boundaries.
A. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) panel numbers 55127C0091D,
55127C0092D, 55127C0093D, 55127C0094D, and 55127C0111D dated
October 2, 2009, with corresponding profiles that are based on the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS), 55127CV000B, dated September 3, 2014.
A. The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters and is contained within AE Zones as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map.
B. The flood-fringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood
limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map.
C. The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered
by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or
floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO Zones on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map.
A. Generally. Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official Floodplain
Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the
criteria in this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be
amended according to § 510-191. The Zoning Administrator can rely on
a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use
permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district
boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning
Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be
§ 510-167 EAST TROY CODE § 510-169
1:1018
§ 510-170. Removal of lands from floodplain.
Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above
the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to § 510-191.
§ 510-171. Compliance required.
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be
in compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable local, state,
and federal regulations.
§ 510-172. Municipalities and state agencies regulated.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties
are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits.
State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies.
The construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state
highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are
exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
§ 510-173. Greater restrictions.
This article supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
regulations enacted under § 61.35, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A
more restrictive provision shall continue in full force and effect to the extent
of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
§ 510-174. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article are the
minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the Village and are
not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. If a provision of this article, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards
in effect on the date of the adoption of this article or in effect on the date of
the most recent text amendment to this article.
settled according to § 510-187C(3) and the review criteria in this
section. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood
elevations from a Flood Insurance Rate Map, FEMA must approve any
map amendment or revision pursuant to § 510-191.
B. Review criteria. If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile
elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base
flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. Where flood
profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale.
§ 510-169 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-175
1:1019
§ 510-175. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering
experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply or
guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free
from flooding and flood damages. This article does not create liability on
the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this
article.
§ 510-176. Annexed areas.
The Walworth County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality
for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an
ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code,
and 44 CFR 59 to 72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These
annexed lands are described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map.
County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the
purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the
Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show
the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.
§ 510-177. Violations and penalties. [Amended 5-1-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-07]
Any violation of the provisions of this article by any person shall be unlawful
and may be subject to a penalty as provided in § 1-4 of the Municipal Code,
but not more than $50 for each offense. Each day of continued violation
shall constitute a separate offense. Every violation of this article is a public
nuisance, and the creation may be enjoined and the maintenance may be
abated by action at suit of the municipality, the state, or any citizen thereof
pursuant to § 87.30, Wis. Stats.

effective model or corrected effective model to reflect any man-made
modifications that have occurred within the floodplain since the date of the
effective model but prior to the construction of the project for which the
revision is being requested. If no modification has occurred since the date
of the effective model, then this model would be identical to the corrected
effective model or duplicate effective model.
MODEL, REVISED (POST-PROJECT)  A modification of the existing or preproject
conditions model, duplicate effective model or corrected effective
model to reflect revised or post-project conditions.

holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located
on a different parcel than the structure.
PUBLIC UTILITIES  Those utilities using underground or overhead
transmission lines, such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and
distribution and collection systems, such as water, sanitary sewer and storm
sewer.

inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain
and any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing
or proposed buildings.
REGIONAL FLOOD  A flood determined to be representative of large
floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with
a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if
depicted on the FIRM the regional flood elevation is equivalent to the base
flood elevation.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement
of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For
an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of
§ 510-178 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 510-178
1:1027
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  Any man-made object with form, shape and utility, either
permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground,
streambed or lake bed, including but not limited to roofed and walled
buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
SUBDIVISION  Has the meaning given in § 236.02(12), Wis. Stats.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure,
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50% of the equalized assessed value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not,
however, include either any project for the improvement of a building
required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations
identified by the Building Inspector and that are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a historic structure,
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure.384
UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP  Where special conditions affecting a
particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict
conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or
density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes
of this article.
VARIANCE  An authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the
construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which
is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in this
article.385
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this article. A structure or other development without
required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing
certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to
be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATERSHED  The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a
watercourse or body of water.
WATER SURFACE PROFILE  A graphical representation showing the
elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a

intended use.
§ 510-179. General standards applicable to all floodplain districts.
A. Generally.
(1) The community shall review all permit applications to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be
constructed with flood-resistant materials; and be constructed to
minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical
equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions
of flooding.
(2) Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above
standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home
parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for
any development that meets the "subdivision" definition of this
article and all other requirements in § 510-185B. Adequate
drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards,
and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical
and water systems, are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages.
B. Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
(1) No floodplain development shall:
(a) Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the
conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development,
causing any increase in the regional flood height; or
(b) Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to
floodplain storage area lost.
(2) The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the
proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in
the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or
other adopted map, unless the provisions of § 510-191 are met.
C. Watercourse alterations.
(1) No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped
floodplain shall be issued until the Zoning Administrator has

Department of Natural Resources and FEMA regional offices and
required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal
permits. The standards of Subsection B must be met, and the floodcarrying
capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be
maintained.386
(2) As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the
date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and pursuant to
§ 510-191, the community shall apply for a letter of map revision
(LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and
approved by FEMA and the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources through the LOMC process.
D. Development requiring state permit. Development which requires a
permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under
Chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats., such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges,
culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary
permits are obtained and amendments are made according to
§ 510-191.

have a low flood damage potential and shall meet the following
provisions:
(1) The campground is approved by the Wisconsin Department of
Health Services;
(2) A land use permit for the campground is issued by the Zoning
Administrator;
(3) The character of the river system and the campground elevation
are such that a seventy-two-hour warning of an impending flood
can be given to all campground occupants;
(4) There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground
that offers the minimum notice required under this Subsection E to
all persons in the campground. This procedure shall include a
written agreement between the campground owner, the municipal
emergency government coordinator and the chief law enforcement
official which specifies the flood elevation at which evacuation shall
occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations, types
of warning systems to be used and the procedures for notifying atrisk
parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for
conducting the evacuation;
(5) This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at
which time the agreement shall be reviewed and updated, by the
officials identified in Subsection E(4), to remain in compliance with

development and any necessary intermediate
locations based on the length of the reach if greater
than 500 feet.
[h] Standard accepted engineering practices shall be
used when assigning parameters for the base model,
such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and
contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The
base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data
such as high-water marks to determine the
reasonableness of the model results. If no historical
data is available, adequate justification shall be
provided for any parameters outside standard
accepted engineering practices.
[i] The model must extend past the upstream limit of the
difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles
in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The
height difference between the proposed flood profile
and the existing study profiles shall be no more than
0.00 foot.
[3] Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be
provided, showing all cross section locations, floodway/
floodplain limits based on best available topographic data,
geographic limits of the proposed development and
whether the proposed development is located in the
floodway.

floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on
the regional flood elevation.
[b] If any part of the proposed development is in the
floodway, it must be added to the base model to show
the difference between existing and proposed
conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients
remain the same as in the existing model, unless
adequate justification based on standard accepted
engineering practices is provided.

(post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the
existing model and any proposed changes to the
topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
[e] All changes to the duplicate effective model and
subsequent models must be supported by certified
topographic information, bridge plans, construction
plans and survey notes.
[f] Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to
the stream reach for which the revision is being
requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream
of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations
and top widths computed by the revised models
matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The
effective model shall not be truncated.
[3] Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources for review which meet the following conditions:

included with the data submission along with the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and
State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with
FEMA mapping specifications.
[e] The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries.
[f] All cross sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map and a
cross section lookup table shall be included to relate
to the model input numbering scheme.
[g] Both the current and proposed floodways shall be
shown on the map.

[Added 5-15-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-08]
§ 510-192. Legislative findings.
The Village Board makes the following legislative findings with regard to
telecommunication towers providing mobile telecommunication services:
§ 510-193. Review procedure for telecommunication tower and
Class 1 co-location.
A. The State Legislature passed 2013 Wisconsin Act 20 [Section 1269(I)]
that imposed limits on local municipalities with respect to regulating
telecommunication facilities within their jurisdictions.
B. The federal government adopted the Telecommunications Act of 1996
which established various requirements relating to telecommunication
facilities.
C. The regulations in this article are intended to promote the public
health, safety, and welfare, while at the same time not unduly
restricting the development of needed telecommunication facilities.
D. The regulations in this article are intended to accomplish the following
purposes, to the fullest extent permitted by law:
(1) Protect the visual character of the Village from the potential
adverse effects of telecommunication facilities;
(2) Ensure that a competitive and broad range of telecommunications
services and high-quality telecommunications infrastructure is
provided;
(3) Create and preserve telecommunication facilities that will serve as
an important and effective part of the Village's emergency response
network;
(4) Minimize the number of towers by requiring co-location; and
(5) Avoid damage to adjoining properties by establishing setback
standards.
A. The general steps outlined below shall be used to review an application
for a new telecommunication tower and a Class 1 co-location as
designated in the Table of Land Uses referenced in § 510-38.
(1) Submittal of application materials. The applicant submits a
