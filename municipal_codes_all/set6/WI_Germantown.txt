1.064 - CODE OF ETHICS . (Cr. Ord. #16-91; Rep. & Recr. Ord. #8-93) 
(1)  DECLARATION OF POLICY. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for all Village officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and commissions of the Village. The purpose of this code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the Village and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the Village. The provisions and purpose of this code and such rules and regulations, as may be established, are hereby declared to be in the best interests of the Village. 
(2)  RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICE. Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, State and municipality and to observe in their official acts the highest standards of integrity and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their prime concern. Their conduct in their official affairs must be and in their private affairs should be above reproach so as to foster respect for all government. 
(3)  DEDICATED SERVICE. All officials and employees of the Village are expected to give support to official actions and programs of the Village. Appointive officials and employees shall adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority as set forth in the Village Code. Officials and employees shall not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they shall work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their work. 
(4)  FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT. 
(a)  Use of Public Property . No official or employee shall request or permit the use of Village-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit. 
(b)  Obligations to Citizens . No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen. 
(5)  CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
(a)  Definitions . 
1.  Financial Interest. Any interest which shall yield directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit to the official or employee or to any person employing or retaining the services of the official or employee. 
2.  Personal Interest. Any interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or from close business or political associations, whether or not any financial interest is involved. 
3.  Person. Any person, corporation, partnership or joint venture. 
4.  Anything of Value. Any money or property, favor, service, payment, advance forbearance, loan or promise of future employment for himself or for his immediate family. 
5.  Immediate Family. 
a.  A person's spouse. 
b.  An individual's relative by marriage, lineal descent or adoption who receives, directly or indirectly, more than 1/2 of his support from the individual or from whom the individual receives, directly or indirectly, more than 1/2 of his support. 
(b)  Financial and Personal Interest Prohibited . No official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall act in regard to financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties in the public interest contrary to the provisions of this section or would tend to impair his independence of judgment or action in the performance of his official duties. 
(c)  Specific Conflicts Enumerated . 
1.  Incompatible Employment. No official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render service for private interest when such employment or service is inconsistent or in conflict with the proper discharge of his official duties or would tend to impair his independence of judgment or action in the performance of his official duties unless otherwise permitted by law and unless disclosures are made as hereinafter provided. 
2.  Disclosure of Confidential Information. No official or employee shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the Village nor shall such information be used to advance financial or other private interests. 
3.  Solicitation or Acceptance Prohibited. 
a.  No official or employee shall solicit nor accept from any person, directly or indirectly, anything of value if it could reasonably be expected to influence the official's or employee's vote, official action or judgment, or could reasonably be considered as a reward for any official action or inaction on the part of the official or employee. Campaign contributions which are permitted and reported under Ch. 11, Wis. Stats., may be accepted. 
b.  No official or employee, or member of the official's or employee's immediate family, shall accept hospitality if, after consideration of the surrounding circumstances, it could reasonably be expected to influence the official's or employee's vote, official action or judgment. An official or employee should discourage any member of his immediate family from accepting hospitality under such circumstances. Participation in ground breakings, celebrations, grand openings, open houses, informational meetings, voter forums and similar events are excluded from this prohibition. 
4.  Representing Private, Personal or Financial Interests Before Village Agencies or Courts. (Rep. & Recr. Ord. #21-93) No elected official, as defined in section 1.01 of this chapter, nor appointed official, as defined in section 1.02 of this chapter, nor employed official, as defined in section 1.03 of this chapter, shall appear on behalf of any private person other than himself, his spouse or minor children before any agency, board, commission, committee, council or department of the Village or before any court involving a case in which the Village has an interest. However, a Trustee may appear before Village agencies on behalf of the Trustee's constituents in the course of the Trustee's duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public and civic obligations. 
(6)  DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST IN LEGISLATION. 
(a)  Any member of the Village Board who has a financial interest or personal interest in any proposed legislation before the Village Board shall disclose on the record of the Board the nature and extent of such interest. 
(b)  Any other official or employee who has a financial interest or personal interest in any proposed legislative action of the Village Board or any board, commission or committee upon which the official or employee has any influence or input or of which the official or employee is a member that is to make a recommendation or decision upon any item which is the subject of the proposed legislative action shall disclose on the records of the Village Board or the appropriate board, commission or committee the nature and extent of such interest.

Accordingly, the provisions of the following sections of the statutes, as from time to time amended, are made a part of this Code of Ethics and shall apply to public officials and employees when ever applicable, to wit:

The members of the Board shall be residents of the Village or full time employees of a business located in the Village or owners of real property located in the Village. The members shall not be elected officials, full time appointed officials or Village employees, nor shall they be currently serving on any other Village board or commission.

Stat. § 111.70(1)(i). 
(2)  MAINTAINING RECORDS. 
(a)  Each officer and employee of the Village shall safely keep and preserve all records received from his predecessor or other persons and required by law to be filed, deposited or kept in his office of which are in the lawful possession or control of the officer or employee or his deputies, or to the possession or control of which he may be lawfully entitled as such officer or employee.

Stat. § 19.21(4)(c), any record required to be kept and preserved under this section may keep and preserve such record through the use of microfilm or another reproductive device, optical imaging or electronic formatting provided that such means meets any applicable standards established under Wis. Stat. §§ 16.61(7) and 16.612. Any photographic reproduction of a record authorized to be reproduced under this paragraph is deemed an original record for all purposes if it meets the applicable standards. Such records shall be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of State law and this Code. 
(3)  LEGAL CUSTODIANS. 
(a)  Each elected official is the legal custodian of his records and the records of his office, but the official may designate an employee of his staff to act as the legal custodian. 
(b)  Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Village Clerk or the Clerk's designee shall act as legal custodian for the Village Board and for any committees, commissions, boards or other authorities created by ordinance or resolution of the Village Board. This shall not include the Police and Fire Departments whose custodians shall be the Police Chief and the Fire Chief, respectively. 
(c)  For every authority not specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the authority's chief administrative officer is the legal custodian for the authority, but the officer may designate an employee of his staff to act as the legal custodian. 
(d)  Each legal custodian shall name a person to act as legal custodian in his absence or the absence of his designee. This subsection shall not apply to the Village Board. 
(e)  The designation of a legal custodian does not affect the powers and duties of an authority under this section. 
(4)  PROCEDURAL INFORMATION. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 19.34, and the guidelines therein listed, each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which the legal custodian from whom and the methods whereby the public may obtain information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of records and the costs thereof. The notice shall also separately identify each position of the authority that constitutes a local public office. Each authority shall also prominently display at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a copy of this section. This section does not apply to members of the Village Board. 
(5)  PUBLIC ACCESS TO RECORDS; FEES. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (7) below, any person has a right to inspect a record and to make or receive a copy of any record as provided in Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1). 
(b)  Records will be available for inspection and copying during all regular office hours. 
(c)  If regular office hours are not maintained at the location where records are kept, the records will be available for inspection and copying upon at least 48 hours' advance notice of intent to inspect or copy. 
(d)  A requester shall be permitted to use facilities comparable to those available to Village employees to inspect, copy or abstract a record. This subsection does not authorize or require the purchase or lease of equipment nor does it require the provision of a separate room for inspection, copying or abstracting of records. 
(e)  The authority may require supervision during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged. 
(f)  A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as follows: 
1.  A cost per page of photocopying, as determined by the Village Clerk, shall be charged. Said cost shall not exceed the actual, necessary and direct costs to the authority of reproduction, and such charges shall be prominently displayed and made available for inspection by the authority at his office. 
2.  If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary cost of photographing and photographic processing shall be charged. 
3.  The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on paper such as films, computer printouts and audio or video tapes shall be charged. 
4.  If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged. 
5.  There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor exceeds $50.00, in which case the actual cost shall be determined by the authority and billed to the requester. 
6.  The authority shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and may require a cash deposit adequate to assure payment if such estimate exceeds $5.00. 
7.  The authority may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where he determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest. 
(6)  ACCESS PROCEDURES. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the authority. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stat. § 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail unless prepayment of a fee is required under subsection (5)(f), above. A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or Federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. When the legal custodian has doubts as to whether the requested records are exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part, he shall have 3 working days to confer with the Village Attorney prior to making a determination. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in subsection (7) below. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within 5 business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stat. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney. 
(7)  LIMITATIONS ON RIGHT TO ACCESS. 
(a)  The limitations on access identified in Wis. Stat. § 19.36 are incorporated herein by reference. 
(b)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
2.  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing. 
3.  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demolition, compensation, performance or discipline of any Village officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a Village officer or employee unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure. 
4.  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. 
5.  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of Village property, investing of Village funds or other Village business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure. 
6.  In accordance with, and subject to Wis. Stat. § 19.356, financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation or privacy interest of any person referred to in such history or data. 
7.  Communications between legal counsel for the Village and any officer, agent or employee of the Village when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the Village or any of its officers, agents or employees is, or is likely, to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stat. § 905.03. 
(d)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the Village Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the Village Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment of the custodian and the Village Attorney, there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. 
(8)  RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS. 
(a)  The Village adopts the General Records Schedule for Wisconsin Municipal and Related Records (the "Wisconsin Municipal Records Schedule" or "WMRS") promulgated by the Wisconsin Public Records Board. A copy of the currently effective Wisconsin Municipal Records Schedule shall be kept on file in the office of the Village Clerk. Unless a different retention period is required by law, any record kept and preserved under this section which is considered obsolete may be destroyed pursuant to the schedule established in the WMRS. For any obsolete record which is not specifically identified in the WMRS, destruction shall occur not less than 7 years after the record was effective. This section shall supersede any previous records schedules adopted by the Village. 
(b)  The Wisconsin State Historical Society shall be notified at least 60 days prior to the destruction of any record under Wis. Stat. § 19.21(4)(a), unless the State Historical Society has otherwise waived the notification requirement. 
(c)  Any tape recording of a governmental meeting of the Village may be destroyed, erased or reused no sooner than 90 days after the minutes of the meeting have been approved and published if the purpose of the recording was to make minutes of the meeting. 
(d)  Police records, other than investigative records, shall be retained for 7 years. However, unless the records are subject to a pending open records request or in any way relate to a matter pending before a court or quasi-judicial body, the following exceptions apply: 
(1)  Videotape and audio cassette recordings utilized for purposes related to law enforcement may be destroyed, erased or reused after 120 days. 
(2)  Recordings made of radio dispatches and telephone calls to and from the dispatch operator may be destroyed, erased or reused after 120 days. 
(e)  This section shall not be construed to authorize the destruction of any public record after a period less than prescribed by statute or State administrative regulations.

Stats., governing general property taxes.

Stats., shall pay to the Village a penalty of the greater of $10.00 or 0.05% of the assessment not to exceed $1,000.00. If the form required under §70.01, Wis. Stats., is not filed within 30 days after the due date or within 30 days after any extension, the taxpayer shall pay to the Village a second penalty of the greater of $10.00 or 0.05% of the full value assessment not to exceed $1,000.00. Penalties are due 30 days after they are assessed and are delinquent if not paid on or before that date. The Village may refund all or part of any penalty it assesses under this subsection if it finds reasonable grounds for the late filing. 
3.10 - DELINQUENT PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES.

As required under Wis. Stat. §66.615(dm), Wis. Stats., the Village authorizes the Tourism Commission to spend that portion of room tax collected not otherwise retained by the Village hereunder, pursuant to §1.378.

Every person required to file such quarterly return shall file an annual calendar year or fiscal year return. Such annual return shall be filed within 90 days of the close of each such calendar or fiscal year. The annual return shall summarize the quarterly returns, reconcile and adjust for errors in the quarterly returns and shall contain certain additional information as the Clerk may require. Such annual return shall be made on a form furnished by the Clerk. All such returns shall be signed by the permittee or his duly authorized agent.

8.065 - REGULATION OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY . (Cr. Ord. #05-16) 
(a)  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE . The Village finds that the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has resulted in increased use of the public rights-of-way and increased costs to the taxpayers of the Village and that these costs are likely to continue into the foreseeable future. 
The Village finds that excavation and occupancy of the public rights-of-way causes direct and indirect costs to be borne by the Village and its taxpayers, including but not limited to: 
(1)  Administrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as registration, permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials. 
(2)  Management costs associated with ongoing management activities necessitated by public right-of-way users. 
(3)  Repair costs to the roadway associated with the actual excavation into the public right-of-way. 
(4)  Degradation costs defined as depreciation caused to the roadway in terms of decreased useful life, due to excavations into the public rights-of-way. 
In response to the foregoing facts, the Village hereby enacts this ordinance relating to administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way, together with an ordinance making necessary revisions to other Code provisions. This ordinance imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of facilities currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. 
The Village's authority to enact this ordinance is pursuant, but not limited to, the following federal, state and local authority: 47 U.S.C. 253(c); Wis. Stat. § 61.34(1); Wis. Stat. § 66.0425; Wis. Stat. § 66.0915; Wis. Stat. § 86.16; Wis. Stat. § 182.017; Wis. Stat. § 196.58; and Wis. Stat. § 196.499(1). 
The purpose of this [section] is to provide the Village a legal framework within which to regulate and manage the public rights-of-way, and to provide for recovery of costs. This [section] provides for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village as they use the rights-of-way of the Village, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of the public rights-of-way. The Village desires to minimize and anticipate the number of excavations taking place thereon and to regulate the placement of facilities within the rights-of-way to ensure that they remain available for public services. The taxpayers of the Village bear the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way. A primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is the frequent excavation by persons who locate facilities therein. Under this chapter, all persons who excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way will reimburse the Village's administrative, ongoing management and degradation costs. Right-of-way users will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for the integrity of the public rights-of-way.

(2)  Payment of Fees . Ongoing management fees shall be subject to adjustment and correction at the conclusion of the calendar year. Such fees shall be paid for all and any part of a calendar year, prorated on a daily basis, during any time period in which the said person uses or occupies the right-of-way to furnish telecommunications service, or places, maintains or uses the person's wires, mains, pipes, or any other facilities in the right-of-way.

9.50 - RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENDERS . (Cr. Ord. #21-07) 
(1)  PURPOSE. This Chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the Village of Germantown from the risk that convicted sex offenders may re-offend in locations close to their residences and against child victims. The Village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders, and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools, day care centers and other places children frequent. The Village finds and declares that in addition to schools and day care centers, children congregate or play at public parks. 
(2)  DEFINITIONS. As used in this Chapter and unless the context otherwise requires:

The Village Board finds that businesses such as restaurants, hotels and taverns make important contributions to the Village's economy and serve important public purposes, including, but not limited to, increasing the Village's property tax base, providing employment and promoting tourism. The Village Board also finds that the new initial fee for Reserve "Class B" licenses far exceeds the actual cost of licensing the activity, and that excessive license fees deter new businesses and are contrary to the above stated public purposes.

Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
(b)  Findings . Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Village Board, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 146 L. Ed. 2d 265, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v.

Enterprises v. City of Houston, 27 F.Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex.1998)), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Village Board finds that: 
1.  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
2.  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. (See, e.g., studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.) 
3.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. (See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 290, 1475-76.) 
4.  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. (See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 290, 1474-76.) 
5.  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. (See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 290, 1474-76.) 
6.  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. (See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida.) 
7.  As of December, 1996, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 774,467. (See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS Update at 3.) 
8.  As of the June 30, 2001, there have been 4,776 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Wisconsin. (See, e.g. Wisconsin Department of Health & Family Services: Wisconsin HIV/AIDS Quarterly Surveillance Summary, Cases Reported 1982 through June 30, 2001.) 
9.  The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 1999 was 659,441, an 8.5% increase over the year 1998. (See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) 
10.  The total number of cases of primary and secondary (Recent infections) syphilis in the United States reported during the twelve year period 1987-1999 was 346,696. (See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) 
11.  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,759,348 cases reported during the period 1995-1999. (See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) 
12.  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
13.  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. (See, e.g., Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) 
14.  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. (See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 290, 1473-76.) 
15.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. (See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 290, 1476.) 
16.  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. (See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991).) 
17.  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. (See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986).) 
18.  Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. (See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. City of Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir. 2000); Sammy's Ltd. v. City of Mobile, 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1052, 146 L. Ed. 2d 459, 120 S. Ct. 1553 (2000).) 
19.  The findings noted in paragraphs numbered 1. through 18. raise substantial governmental concerns. 
20.  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
21.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
22.  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
23.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
24.  It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this section is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
25.  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this section. 
26.  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of 5 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
27.  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this Village will be promoted by enactment of this section.

(5)  ISSUANCE OF LICENSE. 
(a)  Upon the filing of an application for a sexually oriented business employee license, the Clerk shall issue a temporary license to said applicant. The application shall then be referred to the appropriate Village departments for investigation to be made on the information contained in the application. The application process shall be completed within 30 days from the date of the completed application. After the investigation, the Clerk shall issue an employee license, unless it is determined by a preponderance of the evidence that one or more of the following findings is true: (Am. Ord. #30-06) 
1.  The applicant has failed to provide the information reasonably necessary for issuance of the license or has falsely answered a question or request for information on the application form; 
2.  The applicant is under the age of 18 years; 
3.  The applicant has had a sexually oriented business employee license revoked by the Village within 2 years of the date of the current application.

(b)  A license issued pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this subsection, if granted, shall state on its face the name of the person to whom it is granted, the expiration date, and the address of the sexually oriented business.

(c)  A license issued pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this subsection shall be subject to annual renewal upon the written application of the applicant and a finding by the Clerk that the applicant has not been convicted of any "specified criminal activity" as defined in this section, or committed any act during the existence of the previous license which would be grounds to deny the initial license application. The decision whether to renew a license shall be made within 30 days of the completed application. The renewal of a license shall be subject to the fee as set forth in subsection (6). Nonrenewal of a license shall be subject to appeal as set forth in subparagraph (l) of this subsection. 
(d)  If application is made for a sexually oriented business operator's license, the Clerk shall approve or deny issuance of the license within 30 days of receipt of the application.

1.  An applicant has failed to provide the information reasonably necessary for issuance of the license or has falsely answered a question or request for information on the application form; 
2.  An applicant is under the age of 18 years; 
3.  An applicant has been denied a license by the Village to operate a sexually oriented business within the preceding 12 months, or whose license to operate a sexually oriented business has been revoked within the preceding 12 months; 
4.  An applicant is overdue in payment to the Village for fees, fines, or penalties assessed against or imposed upon him/her in relation to the sexually oriented business for which license is sought, or the property on which the sexually oriented business is located or will be located; 
5.  The premises to be used for the sexually oriented business have not been approved by the building inspection department, and planning/zoning department as being in compliance with applicable laws and ordinances, if such approval is required under other sections of this section; 
6.  The license fee required under this section has not been paid. 
(e)  A license issued pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this subsection, if granted, shall state on its face the name of the person or persons to whom it is granted, the expiration date, the address of the sexually oriented business, and the subsection (3) classification for which the license is issued. The license shall be posted in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the sexually oriented business so that it may be easily read at any time. 
(f)  If so required under other sections of this section, the building inspection department, and planning/zoning department shall complete their certification that the premises are in compliance or not in compliance within 20 days of receipt of the completed application by the Clerk. The certification shall be promptly presented to the Clerk. Failure of an appropriate department to timely certify its inspection shall not be grounds for refusing to issue a license within the mandatory time period prescribed in subparagraph (d). (See Nightclubs, Inc. v. City of Paducah, 2000 WL 122184 at 5 (6th Cir. 2000); Baby Tam v. City of Las Vegas, 199 F.3d 1111, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2000).) In the event the Clerk fails to render a decision on the application within the time specified herein, the operator shall be permitted to commence operation of the business. (See Redner v. Dean, 29 F.3d 1495, 1500-01 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1066 (1995).) 
(g)  A sexually oriented business license shall issue for only one classification, as set forth in subsection (3). 
(h)  In the event that the Clerk determines that an applicant is not eligible for a sexually oriented operator's license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing of the reasons for the denial within 30 days of the receipt of the completed application by the Clerk, provided that the applicant may request, in writing at any time before the notice is issued, that such period be extended for an additional period of not more than 10 days in order to make modifications necessary to comply with this section. 
(i)  An applicant may appeal the decision of the Clerk regarding a denial to the Village Board by filing a written notice of appeal with the Clerk within 10 days after service of notice upon the applicant of the Clerk's decision. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a memorandum or other writing setting out fully the grounds for such appeal and all arguments in support thereof. The Clerk may, within 15 days of service upon him or her of the applicant's memorandum, submit a responsive memorandum to the Village Board. After reviewing such memoranda, as well as the Clerk's written decision, if any, and exhibits submitted to the Clerk, the Village Board shall vote either to uphold or overrule the Clerk's decision. Such vote shall be taken within 21 calendar days after the date on which the Clerk receives the notice of appeal. The status quo immediately prior to denial of the license shall be maintained during the pendency of the appeal. (See Nightclubs, Inc. v. City of Paducah, 2000 WL 122184 at 6 (6th Cir. 2000); 4805 Convoy, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 183 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th Cir. 1999).) Judicial review of a denial by the Clerk and Village Board may be made pursuant to subsection (11) of this section.

The operation, maintenance, replacement portion of the sewer use charge shall be computed by allocating the proposed net yearly operation, maintenance, capital and debt replacement budget to the appropriate use factors. The cost allocated to a use factor shall be divided by the expected amount of the use factor to determine the unit cost ($/1,000 gallons $/#) per use factor. The flow use factor will be determined by the Village in conjunction with the Water Utility. The BOD and total suspended solids use factors will be determined from the concentration assigned to domestic wastewater plus surcharge user data. These use factors and the infiltration/inflow use factor will be determined by the Director of Public Works, considering actual data for the previous 12-month period from the Germantown Sewer Utilities and surcharge user data. The residential water consumption for sprinkling as determined by the Water Utility and any water credit meters for any refrigeration, air conditioning or industrial cooling water not entering the sewer system shall not be used in computing the sewer use charge. Users discharging domestic wastewater who are connected to the sewer system who derive all or part of their water discharged to the sewer system from sources other than the Water Utility and who do not have these other water sources metered will be charged for operation, maintenance, replacement, capital and debt retirement costs based upon their estimated water usage as described in section 13.37 of this subchapter. The estimated water usage will be computed by the Water Utility or the Director of Public Works on or before September 1 of every year. 
(3)  ANNUAL CONNECTION CHARGE. An annual connection charge is hereby imposed upon each user connected to the collection system, including nondomestic and industrial waste dischargers. The annual connection charge recovers a portion of the fixed charges of the Sewer Utility. This can include the MMSD connection charge, Village 0 & M costs, replacement costs, capital costs or debt costs. The annual connection charge shall be payable as herein provided and shall be computed on the basis of one unit per connection to the system. 
(4)  INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CHARGES FOR OTHER THAN DOMESTIC WASTEWATER. Charges for wastewater other than domestic wastewater shall be based on flow, BOD, suspended solids and such other constituents which affect the cost of the collection and treatment. All persons discharging wastes into the sewerage system are subject to a surcharge in addition to any other wastewater service charge if their wastewater has a concentration greater than domestic wastewater concentrations. The volume of flow used for computing waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption or the actual volume of waste as determined by a sampling and metering manhole or a discharge monitoring station. The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the Village and MMSD in transporting and removing BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and other pertinent constituents. The surcharge shall be computed on the basis of Model No. 2 contained on page 5270 of the Federal Register, Volume 39, No. 29, February 11, 1974. 
Surcharge = [B c (B) + S c (S) + P c (P) + N c (N)]V u 
Bc = O & M costs for transporting and treatment of a unit of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) 
B = Concentration of BOD from a user above the base level 
Vu = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time Sc, S, Pc, P, Nc, N = Same definition as above, but for the parameters suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen 
(5)  STANDBY CHARGE. See section 13.29(2)(b)2. of this subchapter. 
(6)  SEPTAGE CHARGE. See MMSD Rules and Regulations.

14.01 - TITLE. 
This chapter shall be known as the "Building Code of the Village of Germantown" and will be referred to in this chapter as "this code". 
14.02 - PURPOSE. 
This code provides certain minimum standards, provisions and requirements for safe and stable design, methods of construction and uses of materials in buildings and/or structures hereafter erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, converted to other uses or demolished, and regulates the equipment, maintenance, use and occupancy of all such buildings and/or structures. Its purpose is to protect and foster the health, safety, and well being of persons occupying or using such buildings, and the general public. 
14.03 - SCOPE. 
New buildings hereafter erected in, or any building hereafter moved within or into, the Village shall conform to all the requirements of this code except as they are herein specifically exempted from part or all of its provisions. Any alteration, enlargement or demolition of an existing building and any installation therein of electrical, gas, heating, plumbing or ventilating equipment which affects the health or safety of the users thereof or any other persons, is a "new building" to the extent of such change. Any existing building shall be considered a "new building" for the purposes of this code whenever it is used for dwelling, commercial or industrial purposes unless it was being used for such purpose at the time this code was enacted. The provisions of this code supplement the laws of the State of Wisconsin pertaining to construction and use and the Zoning Code of the Village and amendments thereto to the date this chapter was adopted and in no way supersede or nullify such laws and the said Zoning Code. 
14.04 - BUILDING INSPECTOR. 
(1)  GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES. The Building Inspector shall enforce the provisions of this chapter and of all other ordinances and the laws and orders of the State of Wisconsin which relate to building construction, plumbing and electrical installations and for these purposes may at all reasonable times enter buildings and premises. He may pass upon any questions arising under the provisions of this chapter relating to buildings, subject to conditions contained in this chapter. No person shall interfere with the said Inspector while in the performance of the duties prescribed in this chapter. He shall direct the activities of the Plumbing Inspector and the Electrical Inspector. 
(2)  QUALIFICATIONS. 
(a)  The Building Inspector shall have the necessary qualifications required by the State of Wisconsin to supervise the general construction of buildings. 
(b)  The Building Inspector shall be certified by the Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations to administer and enforce all the provisions of the Wisconsin Uniform Dwelling Code. 
(3)  RECORDS. The Building Inspector shall keep a record of all applications for building permits in a book and regularly number each permit in the order of issuance. He shall keep a record showing the number, description and size of all buildings erected during his term of office, indicating the kind of materials used, the cost of each building and the aggregate cost of all buildings of the various classes. He shall keep a record of all inspections made and of all removal and condemnation of buildings. He shall make a monthly report to the Village Board on the above matters. 
(4)  APPEALS. Any person feeling himself aggrieved by any order or ruling of the Building Inspector may within 20 days thereafter appeal from such order or ruling to the Board of Zoning Appeals, such an appeal to be in writing. 
14.05 - BUILDING PERMITS AND INSPECTION. 
(1)  PERMIT REQUIRED. No building of any kind shall be moved within or into the Village and no new building or structure, or any part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, or ground broken for the same, or enlarged, altered, moved, demolished or used within the Village, except as herein provided, until a permit therefor shall first have been obtained by the owner, or his authorized agent, from the Building Inspector. 
(2)  APPLICATION. Application for a building permit shall be made in writing upon a form furnished by the Building Inspector and shall state the name and address of the owner of the land and also the owner of the building if different, the legal description of the land upon which the building is to be located, the name and address of the designer, the use to which said building is to be put, and such other information as the Building Inspector may require. 
(3)  DEDICATED STREET REQUIRED. No building permit shall be issued unless the property on which the building is proposed to be built abuts a street that has been dedicated for street purposes. 
(4)  UTILITIES REQUIRED. No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any residential building until sewer and water are installed and grading and graveling of the street necessary to service the property for which the permit is required is completed, and a receipt for payment of electrical hookup is presented to the Building Inspector. No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building other than residential until contracts have been let for the installation of sewer, water, grading and graveling in the streets necessary to service the property for which the permit is requested. No person shall occupy any building until sewer, water, grading and graveling are installed in the streets necessary to service the property and a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until such utilities are available to service the property. 
(5)  PLANS. (Am. Ord. #39-90) With such application there shall be submitted a complete set of plans and specifications, including a plot plan showing the location of the proposed building and driveway with respect to adjoining roads, highways, streets, alleys, lot lines and buildings. Plans for buildings involving the State Building Code shall bear the stamp of approval of the State Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations.

Plans for all new one-family and 2-family dwellings shall comply with the provisions of Wis. Adm. Code ILHR 20.09(4). 
(6)  APPROVAL OF PLANS. If the Building Inspector determines that the building will comply in every respect with all ordinances and orders of the Village and all applicable laws and orders of the State of Wisconsin, he shall issue a building permit which shall state the use to which said building is to be put, which shall be kept and displayed at the site of the proposed building. After being approved, the plans and specifications shall not be altered in any respect which involves any of the above mentioned ordinances, laws or orders, or which involves the safety of the building or the occupants, except with the written consent of the Building Inspector. In case adequate plans are presented for part of the building only, the Building Inspector, at his discretion, may issue a permit for that part of the building before receiving the plans and specifications for the entire building. No work is to be started unless the proper grades have been reviewed by the Director of Public Works, including the grade for sidewalks, curb and gutter, driveways and general construction. 
(7)  WAIVER OF PLANS. If the Building Inspector finds that the character of the work is sufficiently described in the application, he may waive the filing of plans for alterations, repairs or moving.

(10)  INSPECTION OF WORK. The builder shall notify the Building Inspector when ready and the Building Inspector shall inspect all buildings upon the completion of the foundation forms, or before the foundation is laid, and again when ready for lath and plaster, or before paneling is applied. After completion, he shall make a final inspection of all new buildings, alterations, and existing buildings put to new uses. If he finds that the work conforms to the provisions of this code, he shall issue a certificate of occupancy which shall contain the date and the result of such inspection, a duplicate of which shall be filed in the office of the Building Inspector. 
(11)  PERMIT LAPSES. (Am. Ord. #13-10) A building, electrical and/or plumbing permit shall lapse and be void unless the permitted work is commenced within 6 months, or no significant progress has been made within one year, from the date of issuance thereof. A reissuance fee of 50% of the original fee shall be charged for any building, electrical or plumbing permit that has lapsed by operation of this section, been cancelled, or expired and is reissued, provided that no substantial changes are made to the original permit. If the permittee requests that the building permit be cancelled, and no work has been done on plan reviews or inspections, 75% of the original permit fee will be refunded to the individual or entity who paid the fee. 
(12)  REVOCATION. If the Building, Plumbing or Electrical Inspector shall find at any time that applicable ordinances, laws, orders, plans and specifications are not being complied with, and that the holder of the permit refused to conform after written warning or instruction has been issued to him, he shall revoke the building, electrical or plumbing permit by written notice posted at the site of the work. When any such permit is revoked, it shall be unlawful to do any further work thereunder until the permit is reissued, except such work as the Building, Electrical or Plumbing Inspector may order to be done as a condition precedent to the re-issuance of the permit or as he may require for the preservation of human life and safety. 
(13)  REPORT OF VIOLATIONS. The police or other Village officers shall report at once to the Building Inspector any building which is being carried on without a permit as required by this chapter.

(a)  Provide uniform regulation of all signal-receiving antenna devices. 
(b)  Secure placement of such antennas in an aesthetically sensitive manner while allowing users reasonable reception of signals. 
(c)  Protect the public from injury from antennas that are inadequately mounted, unduly susceptible to wind pressure, improperly installed and wired, or are placed on structures insufficiently designed or constructed to safely support the antenna. 
(d)  To protect the public interest in preserving prehistoric or historic districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects included in, or eligible for inclusion on, the National Register of Historic Places, as set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. Section 470. 
(2)  PERMITS. Any person desiring to build, construct, use or place any type of signal-receiving antenna shall, prior to such construction, use or placement, provide a general plot plan showing the location of the proposed signal-receiving antenna with respect to streets, lot lines and buildings and a description of the antenna device proposed, to the Building Inspector. Such proposed antenna device shall be approved for construction, use or placement without necessity of the issuance of a permit from the Building Inspector, unless such permit is necessary to protect the public's interest in historic preservation (as set forth in subsection (1)(d) or to protect the public's interest in safety as set forth in subsection (1)(c). In determining the necessity of a permit based upon public safety concerns, the building inspector shall reference the Building Officials and Code Administrators International Code permit provisions on antenna height and set back requirements. 
(3)  DEFINITION. For purposes of this section, a "signal-receiving antenna" is defined as any apparatus capable of receiving communications from a transmitter or a transmitter relay located in a planetary orbit. This definition includes all types of signal-receiving antennas, including, without limitation, parabolic antennas, home earth stations, satellite television disks, UHF and VHF television antennas, and AM, FM and short wave radio antennas, regardless of the method of mounting. 
(4)  APPLICATION. Upon a determination by the Building Inspector that such permit is necessary to protect the public's interest in historic preservation (as set forth in subsection (1)(d) or to protect the public's interest in safety as set forth in subsection (1)(c), application for a signal-receiving antenna permit shall be made in writing to the Building Inspector, together with the appropriate fee and a sufficient set of mounting plans and specifications.

(a)  Setbacks . 
1.  For a ground mounted signal receiving antenna, the required setback shall be not less than the full height of the antenna. 
2.  Subject to the provisions herein, signal receiving antennas shall only be located in the rear yard of any lot. If rear lot placement would unreasonably delay or prevent installation, maintenance or use, unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use, or preclude reception of an acceptable quality signal, the signal receiving antenna shall be placed in the side yard of the lot. If placement of the signal receiving antenna on the rear or side yard of the property would unreasonably or delay or prevent installation maintenance or use, unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use; or preclude reception of an acceptable quality signal; such antenna may be placed in the front yard or on the roof of structures on the property. For corner lots, side yards are the yards that do not face a street. Antennas shall not be regulated differently than other structures of comparable sizes, weight, and safety risk. 
3.  If the location of a signal receiving antenna would threaten the public's interest in public safety or historic preservation, or as set forth in this section, the building inspector shall determine whether the location is possible. 
(b)  Mounting . Signal-receiving antennas attached to the wall or roof of any principal or accessory structure shall be permitted only if the structure is properly constructed to carry all imposed loading and complies with applicable State and local building code requirements. The Building Inspector may require engineering calculations. 
(c)  Diameter . The diameter of the signal receiving antenna shall not exceed 15 feet in diameter except for systems used to provide community antenna television service, or unless such restriction will unreasonably delay or prevent installation, maintenance or use; unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use; or preclude reception of an acceptable quality signal. 
(d)  Height . A permit shall be required for construction of a signal receiving antenna which is more than twelve feet above the roof line or is taller than the distance between the antenna and the lot line. Such permit may be denied on the basis of the height of the proposed placement, whether ground mounted or affixed to a another structure, only wherein the public's interest in safety is threatened for the reasons indicated in subsection (1)(c) above. 
(e)  Wind Pressure . In order that public safety not be threatened by wind pressure upon signal receiving antennas, all signal-receiving antennas shall be permanently mounted in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications for installation, and such installations shall meet a minimum wind load design velocity of 80 miles per hour. 
(f)  Electrical Installations . In order that public safety not be threatened, electrical installations in connection with signal-receiving antennas, including grounding of the system, shall be in accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code, the State Electrical Code and the instructions of the manufacturer. In cases of conflict, the stricter requirements shall govern. All cable used to conduct current or signals from the signal-receiving antenna to the receivers shall be installed underground unless installation site conditions preclude underground installation. The location of all such underground lines, cables and conduits shall be shown on the application for a permit. All signal-receiving antennas shall be grounded against direct lightning strikes. 
(g)  Temporary Placement . Temporary placement is prohibited unless such prohibition would unreasonably delay or prevent installation, unreasonably increase the cost of installation or preclude reception of acceptable quality signals. 
(h)  Advertising . No form of advertising or identification, sign or mural is allowed on the signal-receiving antenna other than the customary manufacturer's identification plates. 
(i)  Interference with Broadcasting . Signal-receiving antennas shall be filtered and/or shielded so as to prevent the emission or reflection of an electromagnetic radiation that would cause any harmful interference with the radio and/or television broadcasting or reception on adjacent properties. In the event that harmful interference is caused subsequent to its installation, the owner of the signal-receiving antenna shall promptly take steps to eliminate the harmful interference in accordance with Federal Communications Commission regulations and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and regulations adopted thereunder. 
(j)  Compliance with Federal Regulations . The installation and use of every signal-receiving antenna shall be in conformity with the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 and regulations adopted thereunder. 
(k)  Aesthetic Considerations. Signal-receiving antennas shall be located and designed to reasonably reduce visual impact from surrounding properties at street level. 
14.13 - UNSAFE BUILDINGS. 
Whenever the Building Inspector finds any building or part thereof within the Village to be, in his judgment, so old, dilapidated or so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, and so that it would be unreasonable to repair the same, he shall order the owner to raze and remove it at the owner's option. Such order and proceedings shall be carried out in the manner prescribed for the razing of buildings in §66.05, Wis. Stats. Where the public safety requires immediate action, the Building Inspector shall enter upon the premises with such assistance as may be necessary and cause the building or structure to be made safe or to be removed, and the expenses of such work may be recovered by the Village in an action against the owner or tenant.

Processing and review fee "escrow account" deposit amounts for each permit application required under this section shall be determined by the Village Planner/Zoning Administrator. In the event that the processing costs for a particular permit application are expected to (or have) exceeded a fee deposit prior to final disposition of a permit application, an additional escrow account fee deposit in an amount to be determined by the Village Planner/Zoning Administrator may be required prior to any further processing of said permit application at the discretion of the Village.

17.27 - PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. 
(1)  INTENT. Planned Development District regulations are intended to permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more creative and imaginative design for the development of a site than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a higher level of amenities, and preservation of the natural qualities of open spaces. The planned development procedure requires a high degree of cooperation between the developer and the Village. The procedure described herein is designed to give the developer general plan approval before completing all detailed design work while providing the Village with assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the time of approval. 
(2)  GENERAL PROVISIONS. The Plan Commission may recommend and the Village Board may, upon the request of the owners, establish planned development districts which will, over a period of time, tend to promote the maximum benefit from coordinated area site planning by permitting the diversified location of structures and mixed dwelling types and mixed compatible uses. 
(a)  Permitted Uses . Permitted and accessory uses in the Planned Development District shall be the same as those permitted in the underlying existing zoning district in which the PDD is located. If a developer desires uses different than those permitted by the existing zoning, the developer must simultaneously petition for rezoning of the underlying existing zoning to a zoning district which allows the desired use(s). 
(b)  Mixed Uses . A mix of different uses within a Planned Development District may be permitted if the Plan Commission and the Village Board determine that the mix of uses is compatible and necessary to achieve the objectives of the PDD. 
(c)  Number of Buildings on a Lot . The Planned Development District may allow more than one building on a lot. 
(d)  Density . The Planned Development District may permit the transfer of density (dwelling units) from one portion of the subject site to another and will permit the clustering of dwelling units in one or more locations within the total site. However, the density of use shall not exceed the density permitted in the underlying existing zoning district except that the Village Board may, upon a favorable vote of 3/4 of the full Village Board, increase the maximum allowable density after considering the community benefits to be derived from the development based upon the size, location, type of development, quality of building materials, and type and amount of aesthetic, architectural, and recreational features and amenities proposed for the development. (Am. Ord. #10-15) 
(e)  Minimum Area for a Planned Development District . Planned Development Districts are intended to provide flexibility to encourage more creative design for all sizes of sites that would be allowed under conventional zoning. To achieve this goal, there is no minimum area for a PDD. 
(f)  Temporary Uses . (Cr. Ord. #32-91) Real estate field offices or shelters for materials and equipment being used in the construction of a permanent structure. 
(3)  APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND REQUIRED INFORMATION. 
(a)  Preliminary Consultation . An applicant may meet with the Plan Commission and appropriate Village staff members for a preliminary consultation prior to formally submitting a rezoning petition for planned development zoning.

Other related information may include, but is not limited to, maintenance standards, plans of operation and economic impact and market feasibility. 
(d)  Public Inspection . The general development plan and related information shall be available for public inspection prior to any rezoning hearing on the proposed project. 
(4)  CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS. 
(a)  The Plan Commission may recommend and the Village Board may adopt, by resolution, conditions and restrictions for planned developments that specify permitted uses, set bulk regulations and density standards for lot coverage and dwelling unit size and distribution and yard setbacks. 
(b)  Conditions and restrictions adopted to govern any planned development may include nonstandard or nonuniform requirements, regulations and provisions recommended by the Plan Commission and approved by the Village Board. Such nonstandard requirements, regulations and provisions shall be designed to insure proper development and appropriate operation and maintenance of specific developments on specific sites. 
(c)  Developers shall agree, by a developer's agreement, with the Village to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including any conditions and restrictions adopted to regulate a specific planned development. 
(5)  DETAILED PLANS AND INFORMATION. (Am.

(b)  No building permit shall be issued until all applicable fees and assessments required in section 18.10 of this Code have been paid and either all public and private construction has been completed and approved or a developer's agreement has been approved by the Village Board. For staged development such developers' agreements shall provide for the construction of improvement and the use of common areas outside of the subject stage. 
(c)  After the Plan Commission has approved the plans, the project shall commence and continue toward completion in accordance with the provisions of section 17.43(11). (Am. Ord. #22-07) 
(8)  MAINTENANCE OF PROJECT.

(b)  Should the owner of a planned development fail to adequately perform maintenance functions such as snow and ice removal, weed cutting or trash disposal, the Village shall have the right to perform such functions or to contract for their accomplishment at the property owner's expense. 
(9)  CHANGES OR REVISIONS. 
(a)  All proposed changes, revisions and additions to any aspect of an approved planned development project shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for its review. The Plan Commission shall determine if the change, revision or addition is minor or if it materially affects the intended design of the project and the impact of the project on neighboring uses. 
(b)  If the change is determined to be minor, the Plan Commission shall review the request and pass its findings to the Village Board, which may approve the change without a public hearing. The Plan Commission's decision on minor changes shall be rendered at a meeting subsequent to the meeting at which the requested change was initially presented to the Plan Commission. (Am. Ord. #54-89) 
(c)  If the requested change is determined by the Plan Commission to be substantial because of its effect on the intended design of the project or on neighboring uses, a public hearing shall be held by the Plan Commission to review and pass its findings to the Village Board for final approval. (Am. Ord. #54-89) 
(10)  APPLICATION OF THE SUBDIVISION AND PLATTING CODE. (Am. Ord. #54-89) To the extent applicable, any planned development shall be subject to the procedures and regulations of chapter 18 of this Code governing the division and platting of land. However, the design standards and required improvements established in chapter 18 may be modified or waived upon recommendation by the Plan Commission and approval by the Village Board where strict compliance would result in not achieving the design flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of the planned development.

The B-3 District is intended to provide for the orderly continuation and revitalization of the older established Main Street "central business district" (including the area designated as "Village Mixed Use" on the Future Land Use Plan) area of the Village where uses are not exclusively of one type but, rather, mixed and include retail sales shops, wholesale and warehousing outlets, and institutional, recreational and residential uses. Many of the existing businesses in this district may not meet the requirements of the B-1 or B-2 Districts. It is the intent of this district to provide minimum requirements for all new uses of land within the district and a guide for the redevelopment or revitalization of existing uses of land within the district. Further, it is intended that the conversion of buildings located in the historic Main Street area and categorized as "Village Mixed Use" on the Village's Land Use Plan map from a residential use to a business use or from a business use to a residential use can occur provided that such conversion does not create conflicts with other nearby land uses, or, that impede the intended transformation of the Main Street area into a pedestrian-oriented retail and entertainment area.

2.  The topsoil removal plan is not being implemented in a good faith manner; or 
3.  The conditions of the permit are not being met. 
(b)  Permit Revocation . If, within 10 days of the issuance of a stop-work order, any permittee does not cease the activity or comply with the topsoil removal plan, the Building Inspector may revoke the permit. 
(c)  Cease and Desist Order . In the event any person without a permit fails to obey a stop-work order or obtain a permit within 10 days, the Building Inspector may request the Village Attorney to obtain a cease and desist order. 
(d)  Special Charge . Ten days after posting a stop-work order, the Building Inspector may issue a notice of intent to the permittee or landowner or land user of his intent to perform work necessary to comply with this section. The Building Inspector may go on the land and commence the work after 14 days from issuing the notice of intent. The costs of the work performed by the Building Inspector shall be billed to the permittee or the landowner. In the event the permittee or landowner fails to pay the amount due, the Village Clerk shall enter the amount due on the tax rolls and collect as a special charge against the property, pursuant to §66.60(16), Wis.

(2)  PURPOSE. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control the division and development of land within the limits of the Village of Germantown in order to promote the public health, safety, morals, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of the Village. 
(3)  INTENT. It is the general intent of this chapter to regulate the division and development of land within the jurisdiction of the Village so as to: 
(a)  Obtain the wise use, conservation, protection and proper development of the Village's soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife resources and attain a proper adjustment of land use and development to the supporting and sustaining natural resource base.

(d)  Secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers. 
(e)  Provide adequate light and air. 
(f)  Facilitate adequate provision for housing, transportation, water supply, stormwater, wastewater treatment, schools, parks, playgrounds and other public facilities and services. 
(g)  Secure safety from flooding, water pollution, disease and other hazards. 
(h)  Prevent flood damage to persons and properties and minimize expenditures for flood relief and flood control projects. 
(i)  Prevent and control erosion, sedimentation and other pollution of surface and subsurface waters. 
(j)  Preserve natural vegetation and cover and promote the natural beauty of the community. 
(k)  Restrict building sites on areas covered by poor soils, or in other areas poorly suited for development. 
(l)  Facilitate the further division of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land.

(4)  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law; however, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. 
(5)  INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Village and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. 
(6)  NONLIABILITY. The Village does not guarantee, warrant or represent that only those soils listed as being unsuited for specific uses are the only unsuited soils within the Village and thereby asserts that there is no liability on the part of the Village Board, its agencies or employees for sanitation problems or structural damages that may occur as a result of reliance upon, and conformance with, this chapter. 
18.02 - GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
(1)  JURISDICTION. Jurisdiction of these regulations shall include all lands within the corporate limits of the Village and those lands within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village as established in §§62.23(2), 61.35 and 66.32, Wis. Stats. The provisions of this chapter, as it applies to divisions of tracts of land into less than 5 parcels, shall not apply to: 
(a)  Transfers of interests in land by will or pursuant to court order. 
(b)  Leases for a term not to exceed 10 years, mortgages or easements. 
(c)  Sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining property if additional lots are not thereby created and the lots resulting are not reduced below the minimum sizes required by these regulations, the Zoning Code or other applicable laws or ordinances. 
(2)  COMPLIANCE. No person shall divide any land located within the jurisdictional limits of these regulations which results in a subdivision, minor land division or a replat as defined herein; no such subdivision, minor land division or replat shall be entitled to record; and no street shall be laid out or improvements made to land without compliance with all requirements of this chapter and the following: 
(a)  Chapter 236, Wis. Stats. 
(b)  Rules of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Health regulating lot size and lot elevation if the land to be subdivided is not served by a public sewer and provisions for such service have not been made. 
(c)  Rules of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation relating to safety of access and the preservation of the public interest and investment in the highway system if the land owned or controlled by the subdivider abuts on a State trunk highway or connecting street. 
(d)  Duly approved comprehensive plan or comprehensive plan component of the Village. 
(e)  Zoning Code and other applicable codes and ordinances of the Village. 
(2a)  DIVISION OF LAND OTHER THAN A SUBDIVISION OR MINOR LAND DIVISION. (Cr. Ord. #09-16) Any division of land, other than a subdivision or minor land division as defined herein, land combination and/or lot line adjustment shall be surveyed and a certified survey map prepared and recorded as provided in Wis. Stats. Chapter 236.34. Such land divisions, combinations and/or lot line adjustments shall also comply with the requirements and applicable procedures for the review, approval and recording of certified survey maps set forth in this chapter. 
(3)  DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF LANDS. 
(a)  Whenever a tract of land to be divided within the jurisdiction of the Village encompasses all or any part of an arterial or collector street, drainage way or other public way which has been designated on a duly adopted Village, County or regional comprehensive plan or comprehensive plan component, said public way shall be made a part of the plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or map and as set forth in section 18.07 of this chapter. 
(b)  Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided within the Village encompasses all or any part of a park, parkway, public school site, drainage way or playground which has been designated on a duly adopted Village comprehensive plan or comprehensive plan component, said park, parkway, public school site, drainage way or playground shall be made a part of the plat and reserved by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or map and as set forth in section 18.07(9) of this chapter. 
(4)  IMPROVEMENTS. Before final approval of any plat or planned development located within the corporate limits of the Village, the subdivider or developer shall install street and utility improvements as hereinafter provided. If such improvements are not installed as required at the time that the final plat is submitted for approval, the subdivider shall, before the recording of the plat, or, in the case of a planned development, the developer, enter into a contract with the Village agreeing to install the required improvements and shall file with said contract a bond meeting the approval of the Village Attorney or a certified check in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvements. The estimate of cost is to be made by the Village Board after review and recommendation by the Village Engineer as a guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or the developer not later than one year from the date of recording of the plat or, in the case of a planned development, the approval of the Village Board, and as a further guarantee that all obligations to subcontractors for work on the development are satisfied. In addition: 
(a)  Contracts and contract specifications for the construction of street and utility improvements on dedicated street rights-of-way, as well as the contractors and subcontractors providing such work, shall be subject to the approval of the Village Engineer. 
(b)  Governmental units to which these bond and contract provisions apply may file, in lieu of said contract and bond, a letter from officers authorized to act on their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section. 
(c)  Survey monuments shall be installed by the subdivider before final approval of any plat within the Village and such survey monuments shall be placed in accordance with the requirements of §236.15, Wis. Stats., and as may be required by the Village Engineer. 
(5)  VARIANCES. Where, in the judgment of the Plan Commission, it would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of sections 18.07 and 18.08 of this chapter because of the proposed subdivision being located outside of the corporate limits of the Village or because exceptional or severe hardship would result, the Plan Commission may waive or modify any requirements to the extent deemed just and proper. No variance to the provisions of this chapter shall be granted, however, unless the Plan Commission makes a specific finding based on documented evidence that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings: 
(a)  Exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions exist where a literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would result in severe hardship. Such hardships should not apply generally to other properties or be of such a recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed. 
(b)  Preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same vicinity will not be adversely affected. 
(c)  Detriment to adjacent property will not be created and the variance will not materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest. 
A majority vote of the entire membership of the Plan Commission shall be required to grant any modification of this chapter. The Village Board may waive the placing of monuments, required under §236.15(b), (c) and (d), Wis. Stats., for a reasonable time period on condition that the subdivider execute a surety bond to insure the placing of such monuments within the required time limits established by the statute. 
(6)  LAND SUITABILITY. No land shall be subdivided or developed which is determined to be unsuitable for its proposed use by the Plan Commission for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the Village. In addition: 
(a)  No lot or parcel 2 acres or less in area shall include floodplain or wetlands, and all lots or parcels more than 2 acres in size shall contain not less than one acre of land which is at an elevation at least 2 feet above the elevation of the 100-year floodplain or, where such data is not available, 5 feet above the maximum flood of record. Generally, floodplain and wetlands within a parcel of land subject of a subdivision plat or certified survey map "minor" land division and the area within any required setbacks extending outward from any such floodplain or wetlands should be platted so as to be included in open space or other outlots and not within or part of a developable lot or parcel. (Cr. Ord. #09-08) 
(b)  Lands made, altered or filled with non-earth materials within the preceding 20 years shall not be divided into building sites. 
(c)  Lands made, altered or filled with earth within the preceding 7 years shall not be divided into building sites which are to be served by on-site soil absorption sanitary sewage disposal systems. 
(d)  No lot proposed to be served by an on-site soil absorption sanitary sewage disposal system shall have less than 20,000 square feet in slopes of 10% or less. A grading plan showing both existing and proposed contours shall be submitted with any plat on which it is proposed to alter the natural topography in order to meet this requirement. 
(e)  Lands having bedrock within 6 feet of the natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into building sites to be served by on-site soil absorption sanitary sewage disposal systems. 
(f)  Lands having ground water within 6 feet of the natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into building sites to be served by on-site soil absorption sanitary sewage disposal systems.

(g)  Lands covered by soils having a percolation rate slower than 60 minutes per inch, or faster than 10 minutes per inch in shoreland areas, shall not be divided into building sites to be served by on-site soil absorption sanitary sewage disposal systems. 
(h)  The soil types shown on Table 1, identified by both their numerical and alphabetical symbols as used by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, respectively, are soils which have either very severe or severe limitations for residential development served by on-site soil absorption sanitary sewage disposal systems, and shall not be divided into building sites. 
The Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of this section shall, in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is unsuitable for residential use and afford the subdivider or developer an opportunity to present evidence in rebuttal to such findings of unsuitability if he so desires. Thereafter the Plan Commission may affirm, modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. 
(7)  APPEALS. Any person aggrieved by an objection to a plat or a failure to approve a plat may appeal such objection or failure as provided in §236.13(5) and Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., within 30 days of notification of the rejection of the plat. Where failure to approve is based on an unsatisfied objection, the agency making the objection shall be made a party to the action. The court shall direct that the plat be approved if it finds that the action of the approving or objecting agency is arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory. 
(8)  CONDOMINIUMS. (Cr. Ord. #35-93; Readopted Ord. #4-94) This chapter of this Code is applicable to condominiums having more than one principal building, as defined in section 17.08(14) of this Code, on a single lot or parcel of land. Such condominiums are treated as planned developments and, in accordance with section 17.27(10) of this Code, the public site fee provisions of section 18.07(9)(b) of this chapter are applicable. 
18.03 - LAND DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES. 
(1)  PREAPPLICATION. It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider consult with the Village staff including the Zoning Administrator, the Building Inspector, the Engineer and the Planner in order to obtain their advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the comprehensive plan, comprehensive plan components, and duly adopted plan implementation devices of the Village and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning his development. In so doing, both the subdivider and the Village staff may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(2)  PRELIMINARY PLAT REVIEW. (Am. Ord. #5-01) Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and a letter of application. The preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter, and the subdivider shall file an adequate number of copies of the plat and the application with the Village Clerk at least 35 days prior to the meeting of the Village Board at which action is desired. In addition: 
(a)  The Village Clerk shall, within 3 work days after filing, transmit 2 copies to the County Planning and Park Department; 4 copies to the Director of the Planning Function in the State Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection for retransmission of copies to the State Department of Transportation if the subdivision abuts or adjoins a State trunk highway or a connecting street, the State Department of Health and Social Services if the subdivision is not served by a public sewer and provision for such service has not been made, and the State Department of Natural Resources if shorelands are contained within the proposed subdivision; and an adequate number of copies to the Plan Commission. 
The County Planning and Park Department, the State Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection, the State Department of Transportation, the State Department of Health and Social Services, and the State Department of Natural Resources shall hereinafter be referred to as objecting agencies and, within 20 days from the date of receiving the preliminary plat, must transmit to the Village Clerk any objections to the plat. The Village Board is hereby designated as approving authority for all preliminary plats. 
(b)  The Village Clerk shall also transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to all affected Village boards, commissions or departments, the school board, the Washington County Land Conservation Department, and all affected local utility companies for their review and comments and recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their comments and recommendations shall be transmitted to the Plan Commission/Village Board within 20 days from the date the plat is received from the Village Clerk. 
(c)  Following receipt of all objections and review comments, the Plan Commission shall then review the preliminary plat for conformance with this chapter and all affected ordinances, rules, regulations, comprehensive plans and comprehensive plan components, and any comments and recommendations received. 
(d)  The Plan Commission shall within 60 days of the date of the filing of a Preliminary Plat with the Village Clerk (or other Village Board authorized agent), recommend to the Village Board, approval, conditional approval or rejection of the Preliminary Plat and shall transmit the Preliminary Plat and application along with its recommendation to the Village Board. 
(3)  PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL. The objecting agencies shall, within 20 days of the date of receiving their copies of the preliminary plat, notify the subdivider, the Plan Commission and all other objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy of the plat and shall return that copy to the Village Clerk. If an objecting agency fails to act within 20 days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. In addition: 
(a)  The subdivider shall pay all applicable fees, as set forth in section 18.10(2), (7) and (8) of this chapter, at the time of application for preliminary plat approval. 
(b)  The Village Board, within 90 days of the date of filing of the preliminary plat with the Village Clerk, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement, shall approve, approve conditionally, or reject such plat. One copy of the plat shall thereupon be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon; and, if approved conditionally or rejected, a letter setting forth the conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection shall accompany the plat. One copy each of the plat and letter shall be placed in the Plan Commission's permanent file. 
(c)  Failure of the Village Board to act within 90 days, unless the time if extended by mutual agreement, shall constitute approval. 
(d)  Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the final plat, except that if the final plat is submitted within 36 months of preliminary plat approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat layout as indicated in §236.11(1)(b), Wis. Stats., the final plat shall be entitled to approval with respect to such layout. The preliminary plat shall be deemed an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the final plat which will be subject to further consideration by the Village Plan Commission at the time of its submission. Preliminary plats must comply with the subdivision regulations that were in effect on the date when the plat was submitted to the Village. (Am. Ord. #20-99; Am. Ord. #24-10) 
(e)  If permitted by the Village Board, the approved preliminary plat may be final platted in phases with each phase encompassing only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record at one time; however, it is required that each such phase, when final platted, be designated as a "phase" of the approved preliminary plat. 
(4)  FINAL PLAT REVIEW. The subdivider shall prepare a final plat of all or a designated "phase" of an approved preliminary plat along with a letter of application in accordance with this chapter and shall file an adequate number of copies of the plat and the application with the Village Clerk at least 60 days prior to the meeting of the Village Board at which action is desired. In addition: 
(a)  The Village Clerk or subdivider shall, within 3 days after filing, cause to be transmitted 2 copies of the final plat to the Washington County Planning and Park Department and 4 copies to the Director of the Planning Function in the State Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection for retransmission of copies to the State Department of Transportation if the subdivision abuts or adjoins a State trunk highway or a connecting street, the State Department of Health and Social Services if the subdivision is not served by a public sewer and provision for such service has not been made, and the State Department of Natural Resources if floodlands are contained within the proposed subdivision; and the original final plat and adequate copies to the Plan Commission. 
(b)  Following receipt of all objections or comments, the Plan Commission shall examine the final plat as to its conformance with the approved preliminary plat; any conditions of approval of the preliminary plat; this chapter and all ordinances, rules, regulations, comprehensive plans and comprehensive plan components which may affect it, objections and review comments, and shall recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the plat to the Village Board. The Plan Commission shall consider the recommendation of the Village Planner and Village Engineer to approve or deny the preliminary plat based on their determination that the final plat substantially conforms to the preliminary plat. (Am. Ord. #24-10) 
(5)  FINAL PLAT APPROVAL. The objecting agencies shall, within 20 days of the date of receiving their copies of the final plat, notify the subdivider, the Plan Commission and all other objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy of the plat and shall return that copy to the Plan Commission. If any objecting agency fails to act within 20 days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. In addition: 
(a)  Failure of a subdivider to submit a final plat of all or designated phases of an approved preliminary plat within 36 months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute a rescinding of the preliminary plat approval. The subdivider may resubmit the previously approved preliminary plat or other plat in accordance with subsection (2) above. If no preliminary plat is submitted, final plats must comply with the subdivision regulations that were in effect on the date when the plat was submitted to the Village. (Am. Ord. #20-99; Am. Ord. #24-10) 
(b)  At the time of application for final plat approval, the subdivider shall pay all applicable fees as set forth in section 18.10 of this chapter. 
(c)  The Plan Commission shall, within 30 days of the date of filing of the final plat with the Village Clerk, recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the plat and shall transmit the final plat and application along with its recommendations to the Village Board. 
(d)  The Plan Commission shall, at the time that it recommends approval of a plat to the Village Board, give at least 10 days written notice of its recommendation to the clerk of any other municipality within 1,000 feet of the plat. 
(e)  The Village Board shall, within 60 days of the date of filing the original final plat or "phase" with the Village Clerk, approve or reject such plat unless the time is extended by mutual agreement with the subdivider. If the plat is rejected, the reasons shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting and a written statement of the reasons forwarded to the subdivider. The Village Board may not inscribe its approval on the final plat unless the Village Clerk certifies on the face of the plat that the copies were forwarded to objecting agencies as required herein, the date thereof, and that no objections have been filed within 20 days, or, if filed, have been met. 
(f)  Failure of the Village Board to take action on the plat within 60 days, the time having not been extended and no unsatisfied objections having been filed, the plat shall be deemed approved. 
(g)  After the final plat has been approved by the Village Board and required improvements either installed or a contract and sureties insuring their installation is filed, and all applicable fees have been paid to the Village, the Village Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting to such approval to be duly executed and the plat recorded with the County Register of Deeds. The subdivider may construct a development in phases as the Village approves, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. If the development will be constructed in phases, the amount of any surety or other financial security required by the Village shall be limited to the phase of the project that is currently being constructed. The Village may not require that the subdivider provide any security for improvements sooner than is reasonably necessary before the commencement of the installation of the improvements. (Am. Ord. #24-10) 
(h)  The Register of Deeds shall not record the plat unless it is offered within 12 months after the date of the last approval of the plat and within 36 months after the first approval. (Am. Ord. #19-03; Am. Ord. #24-10) 
(i)  The subdivider shall file one reproducible positive film copy of the final plat with the Village Clerk for copying and distribution to the Village Engineer, Building Inspector, Assessor and other affected departments for their files. 
(6)  REPLAT. When it is proposed to replat a recorded subdivision, or part thereof, so as to change the boundaries of a recorded subdivision, or part thereof, the subdivider or person wishing to replat shall vacate or alter the recorded plat as provided in §§236.40 through 236.44, Wis. Stats. The subdivider, or person wishing to replat, shall then proceed as specified in subsections (1) through (5) above. 
In addition, the Village Clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the Plan Commission when a preliminary plat of a replat of lands within the Village is filed, and shall cause notices of the proposed replat and public hearing to be mailed to the owners of all properties within the limits of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat and to the owners of all properties within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat. 
(6a)  CONFLICTS WITH STATE STATUTES. (Cr. Ord. #24-10) To the extent that this chapter contains time limits, deadlines, notice requirements or other provisions that are more restrictive than the time limits, deadlines, notice requirements or other provisions that provide protections for a subdivider contained in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., the time limits, deadlines, notice requirements or other provisions that provide such protections contained in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., shall apply. 
(7)  MINOR LAND DIVISION. 
(a)  Certified Survey Map Required. (Am. Ord. #26-94; Am. Ord. #21-99; Am. Ord. 09-16) When it is proposed to divide land into not more than 4 building parcels or lots, any one of which is less than 20 acres in size, or when it is proposed to create by land division not more than 4 lots within a recorded subdivision plat without changing the boundaries of said block, lot or outlot, or as required under subsection 18.02(2a), the subdivider shall subdivide by use of a certified survey map. The subdivider shall prepare the certified survey map in accordance with this chapter and shall file the required number of copies of the map and a letter of application with the Village Planner at least 15 days prior to the meeting of the Plan Commission as specified by the Village Planner. 
(b)  Procedure . 
1.  The Village Planner shall transmit the copies of the map and letter of application to the Plan Commission at its next regular scheduled meeting. 
1a.  If the certified survey map abuts a state trunk highway, it shall conform to Trans 233, Wisconsin Department of Transportation's Administrative Rule. The subdivider shall submit written documentation from the Department of Transportation of conformance to Trans 233.04 to 233.10, inclusive, prior to any action by the Village of Germantown. 
2.  At the time of application for approval of a minor land division, the subdivider shall pay all applicable fees as set forth in section 18.10(6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11) of this chapter. 
3.  The Village shall also transmit a copy of the map to all affected Village boards, commissions or departments for their review and recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their recommendations shall be transmitted to the Plan Commission within 10 days from the date the map is filed. The map shall be reviewed by the Plan Commission for conformance with this chapter and all affected ordinances, rules, regulations, comprehensive plans and comprehensive plan components. The Plan Commission shall, within 30 days from the date of filing of the map, recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the map, and shall transmit the map along with its recommendations to the Village Board. 
4.  The Village Board shall approve, approve conditionally or reject such map within 90 days from the date of filing of the map unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. If the map is rejected, the reason shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting and a written statement forwarded to the subdivider. (Am. Ord. #09-16) 
5.  If the map is approved and all applicable fees, as set forth in sections 18.07 and 18.10 of this chapter, have been paid to the Village, the Village Board shall cause the Village Clerk to so certify on the face of the original map and record the map with the County Register of Deeds. 
6.  The Village Clerk shall record the map with the County Register of Deeds within 30 days of its approval by the Village Board. The subdivider shall pay for the cost of recording. 
7.  The Village Clerk shall file one reproducible copy of the certified survey map and distribute copies to the Village Engineer, Building Inspector, Assessor and other affected departments for their files. 
(8)  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. See section 17.27 of this Code. 
(9)  WETLAND DELINEATION REQUIREMENTS. (Cr. Ord. #09-16) The delineation of wetland boundaries required herein shall follow current recommended procedures and practices of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) as specified under Admin. Code NR103 and NR352 (as may be amended). The boundaries of wetlands presented on subdivision plats and certified survey maps required under this section for purposes of reviewing and approving land divisions shall be based on wetland delineations conducted no sooner than 5 years before the date of submission of a subdivision plat or certified survey map application unless it is determined by Village staff that significant physical changes have been made to the wetland area(s) being delineated or the upland area(s) adjacent thereto, or, other circumstances exist that can reasonably be expected to have affected the extent of such wetland(s). In which case, a new wetland delineation shall be required.

18.04 - PRELIMINARY PLAT. 
(1)  GENERAL. A preliminary plat shall be required for all subdivisions and shall be based upon a survey by a registered land surveyor and the plat shall be prepared on tracing cloth, reproducible drafting film or paper of good quality at a map scale not larger than 100 feet to the inch and shall show correctly on its face the following information: 
(a)  Title or name under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded. 
(b)  Proper location of proposed subdivision by government lot, quarter section, town, range, county and state. 
(c)  General location sketch showing the location of the subdivision within the U. S. Public Land Survey section. 
(d)  Date, graphic scale and north point. 
(e)  Names and addresses of the owner, subdivider and land surveyor preparing the plat. 
(f)  The entire area contiguous to the proposed plat owned or controlled by the subdivider shall be included on the preliminary plat even though only a portion of said area is proposed for immediate development. The Plan Commission may waive this requirement where it is unnecessary to fulfill the purposes and intent of this chapter and severe hardship would result from strict application thereof.

(a)  Exact length and bearing of the center line of all streets. 
(b)  Exact street width along the line of any obliquely intersecting street. 
(c)  Railroad rights-of-way within and abutting the plat. 
(d)  Setbacks or building lines required by the Plan Commission or other Village ordinances. 
(e)  Utility and drainage easements. 
(f)  All lands dedicated for public use, reserved for future public acquisition, or reserved for the common use of property owners within the plat. 
(g)  Special restrictions required by the Plan Commission relating to access control and along public ways or to the provision of planting strips. 
(3)  DEED RESTRICTIONS. The Plan Commission may require that deed restrictions be filed with the final plat. 
(4)  SURVEY ACCURACY. The Village Engineer shall examine all final plats within the Village and may make, or cause to be made by a registered land surveyor under the supervision or direction of the Village Engineer, field checks for the accuracy and closure of survey, the proper kind and location of monuments, and the legibility and completeness of the drawing. In addition: 
(a)  Maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance or position, the ratio of one part in 10,000 (1:10,000), nor in azimuth, 4 seconds of arc per interior angle. If field measurements exceed this maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure is obtained. When a satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained, the survey of the exterior boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure. 
(b)  All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed exterior boundary survey. If field checks disclose an error for any interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of one part in 5,000 (1:5,000), or an error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer, necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the quotient of 300 divided by the length of the shorter side; however, such error shall not in any case exceed 5 minutes of arc. 
(c)  Where the plat is located within a U.S. Public Land Survey one-quarter section, the corners of which have been relocated, monumented and coordinated by the Village, Washington County or the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, the tie required by §236.20(3)(b), Wis. Stats., shall be expressed in terms of grid bearing and distance; and the material and Wisconsin State plane coordinates of the monument marking the relocated section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be determined by a closed survey meeting the error or closure herein specified for the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. 
(d)  The Village Board shall receive the results of the Village Engineer's examination prior to approving the final plat. 
(5)  SURVEYING AND MONUMENTING. All final plats shall meet all the surveying and monumenting requirements of §236.15, Wis. Stats. 
(6)  STATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM. Where the plat is located within a U.S. Public Land Survey 1/4 section, the corners of which have been relocated, monumented and coordinated by the Village, Washington County or the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, the plat shall be tied directly to one of the section or quarter section corners so relocated, monumented and coordinated. The exact grid bearing and distance of such tie shall be determined by field measurements, and the material and Wisconsin State plane coordinates of the monument marking the relocated section or quarter section corner to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to the Wisconsin Coordinate System, South Zone, and adjusted to the Village's control survey. 
(7)  CERTIFICATES. All final plats shall provide all the certificates required by §236.21, Wis. Stats., and, in addition, the surveyor shall certify that he has fully complied with all the provisions of this chapter.

18.061 - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE. 
See section 17.27(3) of this Code. 
18.07 - DESIGN STANDARDS. 
(1)  STREET ARRANGEMENT. In any new subdivision, or in any planned development, if applicable, the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location indicated on the Official Map, County Jurisdictional Highway Plan, comprehensive plan or plan component, or detailed neighborhood unit development plan of the Village. In areas for which detailed neighborhood unit development plans have not been completed, the street layout shall conform to the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, to existing or planned utilities, and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street. In addition: 
(a)  Arterial Streets . Arterial streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of arterial streets and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to connect. 
(b)  Collector Streets . Collector streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide for the collection of traffic from residential and other high intensity use areas and conveyance of such traffic to the arterial street and highway system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the arterial streets to which they connect. 
(c)  Minor Streets . Minor streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm drainage, water supply and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(d)  Private Streets . (Cr. Ord. #04-08) Private streets are a type of "minor street" that shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm drainage, water supply and sanitary sewerage systems, and provide the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. Private streets include shared driveways, private lanes, and private streets intended to serve 2 to 15 single-family residential lots or parcels (as well as condominium-type development) and may be allowed by the Village in accordance with all of the following: 
1.  Private street are intended to retain rural character, reduce construction and maintenance costs, serve relatively larger and more rural lots, and allow more control, security and sense of identity where public streets or roads are not planned or needed for public traffic circulation and accessibility; 
2.  Private streets are only allowed at the discretion of the Village Board as approved as part of a subdivision plat, certified survey map (CSM) or condominium plat; 
3.  Private streets may be allowed in any single-family residential zoning district, however, the Village Board may require private streets to be developed as part of a Planned Development District (PDD); 
4.  Private streets shall NOT be allowed under any circumstances when: 
a.  The proposed private street will replace or otherwise conflict with a designated public street set forth in the Village's official map, Comprehensive Plan, or other official state, regional, county, or village transportation plan; 
b.  The Village determines that construction of a public street would be in the best interest of the Village and that a public (vs. private) street is determined to be needed for: (1) providing access to adjacent lands having the potential for future development; or (2) public circulation by way of connecting to or extending from an existing or future public street; 
c.  The proposed private street connects 2 or more public streets or highways where the connection would further the pattern and function of the public street system; or 
d.  The proposed street will or has the potential to provide access to more than 15 residential lots, or, has the potential to provide (or is needed for) access to future development of adjacent land. 
5.  Private streets shall be owned and maintained by the property owners of the lots or parcels having access to and served by such private streets and/or a legal entity (e.g., Homeowner's Association, Condominium Association, etc.) established prior to or concurrent with Village approval of the subdivision plat or Certified Survey Map. Ownership and maintenance responsibilities shall be set forth in deed restrictions or covenants reviewed and approved by the Village. The arrangement, design, and construction (including arrangements for construction inspection by qualified engineers) of private streets shall be approved by the Village as set forth in a Development Agreement with the Village as required under this section. 
6.  These standards and the design requirements in Table 3 are intended to be minimums that may be modified by the Village, including the requirement for a higher or different standard regardless of the private street classification, as determined on a case-by-case basis through the Planned Development District (PDD) review process or as specified in a Development Agreement required under this section. 
7.  The construction of private streets and the development and use of land that includes private streets shall comply with all zoning, land development and other applicable Village codes and requirements, including but not limited to, the Village's stormwater management regulations. 
(e)  Proposed Streets . (Rltd. Ord. #04-08) Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided or developed unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or development or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. Where an existing dedicated or platted half street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided or developed, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider or developer. 
(f)  Protection and Limited Access . (Rltd. Ord. #04-08) Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to an arterial street or highway, adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage lots, screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or by the use of frontage streets. 
(g)  Stream or Lake Shores . (Rltd. Ord. #04-08) Stream or lake shores shall have a minimum of 60 feet of public access platted to the low water mark at intervals of not more than 1/2 mile as required by §236.16(3), Wis. Stats. 
(h)  Reserve Strips . (Rltd. Ord. #04-08) Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is placed with the Village under conditions approved by the Plan Commission. 
(i)  Alleys . (Rltd. Ord. #04-08) Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas for off-street loading and service access unless otherwise required by the Plan Commission, but shall not be approved in residential districts. Dead end alleys shall not be approved and alleys shall not connect to an arterial street or highway. 
(j)  Street Names . (Rltd. Ord. #04-08) Street names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names on nonconnecting streets elsewhere in the Village and existing street names shall be extended wherever possible. 
(2)  LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY AND RAILROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY TREATMENT. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, the subdivision shall include the following design restrictions: 
(a)  When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-of-way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth. This strip shall be a part of the platted lots, but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "this strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs; the building of structures hereon is prohibited." 
(b)  Commercial and industrial properties fronting on the right-of-way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or railroad shall have provided, on each side of the limited access highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but not less than 200 feet. 
(c)  Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting an arterial street, highway or collector street which crosses said railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
(d)  Minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided and location of minor streets immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways and to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas. 
(3)  PUBLIC STREET AND PUBLIC WAY DESIGN STANDARDS. (Am. Ord. #38-05; Am. Ord. #04-08) The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all proposed public streets and alleys shall be as specified by the comprehensive plan, comprehensive plan component, official map, neighborhood development study; or the standard cross-section adopted by the Village (see Table 2 or Table 2a); or if no width is specified therein, the minimum widths shall be as set forth in Table 2. 
Arterial street sections are for standard arterial streets only. Cross-sections for freeways, expressways and parkways should be based upon detailed engineering studies. In addition all minor streets that are planned and designed to not be extended or connected to another street at the time of development or at any time in the future (i.e., a "dead end" street) shall include a cul-de-sac meeting the following requirements: 
(a)  All non-cul-de-sac streets designed having one end permanently closed, shall not exceed 500 feet in length. Cul-de-sac streets not exceeding 500 feet in length are permitted as a matter of course. 
(b)  Where a cul-de-sac street is designed so that it's bulb right-of-way abuts the subdivision perimeter property line, making future extension of the roadway, or connection to another roadway feasible; the Plan Commission may approve a design of up to 1,200 feet in length. 
(c)  Other cu-de-sac roads may be approved at lengths greater than 500 feet but not exceeding 1,200 feet in length depending upon such factors as: 
1.  The zoning classification and resultant lot size, with larger lots abutting the cu-de-sac street justifying and permitting the approval of a proportionately longer cul-de-sac street; 
2.  The number, and proximity to Village arterials roads, of entry points into the subdivision, including those feasible for extension and connection in the future. 
(d)  Except in section 27-9-20 of the Village, as set forth in Table 2a, all cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 60 feet and a minimum face of curbs radius of 40 feet on urban sections and 40 feet on rural sections (see Table 2). 
(e)  The length of a cul-de-sac shall be defined as the distance from the nearest intersecting right-of-way from the subject cul-de-sac street along the centerline of said cul-de-sac to the point at the bulb right-of-way furthest from the connecting street.

(1)  ALLEY. A special public way affording only secondary and service access to abutting properties. 
(2)  ARTERIAL STREET. A street used, or intended to be used, primarily for fast or heavy interneighborhood or intercommunity through traffic. Arterial street shall include freeways and expressways as well as standard arterial streets, highways and parkways.

(6)  COMMUNITY. A town, incorporated municipality or a group of adjacent towns and/or incorporated municipalities having common social, economic or physical interests or characteristics. 
(7)  COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. An extensively developed plan, also called a master plan, adopted by the Plan Commission and certified to the Village Board pursuant to §62.23, Wis.

Such development may be expected to alter or require the altering of land and land cover and have detrimental impact on the ground and surface waters. Historically, in southeastern Wisconsin, when residential development is concentrated in densities in excess of 0.2 dwelling units per gross acre (or one dwelling unit per 5 acres), the demand of and, in some cases, the requirement for the provision of such urban services and facilities by the local unit of government is initiated by residents of such development.

Historically, in southeastern Wisconsin, when residential development densities are less than 0.2 dwelling units per gross acre (or one dwelling unit per 5 acres), such traditional urban services are not required and the residents of such rural development do not demand such services. In addition, rural development may be expected to result in minimum disturbance of the land and the land cover and, therefore, less impact in the natural environment.

(20)  HIGH GROUND WATER ELEVATION. The highest elevation to which subsurface water rises. This may be evidenced by the actual presence of water during wet periods of the year, or by soil mottling during drier periods. "Mottling" is a mixture of variation of soil colors.

Double frontage lots abutting arterial highways should restrict direct access to the arterial highway by means of a planting buffer or some other acceptable access buffering measure. 
(24)  MINOR STREET. A street used, or intended to be used, primarily for access to abutting properties. 
(25)  MINOR LAND DIVISION. (Am. Ord. #10-98) Any division of land not defined as a subdivision.

23.01 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, TITLE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
(1)  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§61.35 and 62.23 Wis. Stats., for villages and cities; §§59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 Wis. Stats. for counties; and the requirements in §87.30 Wis. Stats 
(2)  FINDING OF FACT. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(3)  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(a)  Protect life, health and property; 
(b)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(d)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(f)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(g)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(h)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(i)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(4)  TITLE. This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village of Germantown, Wisconsin. 
(5)  GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
(a)  Areas to be Regulated . This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(b)  Official Maps and Revisions . The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (see section 23.08 Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator, Village of Germantown, Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
1.  Official Maps. Based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)(Am. Ord. #08-15) 
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) panel number 55131C0268D, 55131C0269D, 55131C0288D, 55131C0290D, 55131C0357D, 55131C0359D, 55131C0376D, 55131C0377D, 55131C0378D and 55131C0379D, dated November 20, 2013; and panel numbers 55131C356E and 55131C0358E, dated October 16, 2015 with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated October 16, 2015 Volume #55131CV001B, #55131CV002B and #55131CV003B 
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA. 
2.  Official Maps . Based on other studies: 
a.  Letters of Map Revision: 
    Case No. 95-05-2144A issued 11/21/1995. 
    Case No. 96-05-2562A issued 10/04/1996. 
    Case No. 99-05-688C issued 01/22/1999. 
    Case No. 99-05-6616A issued 09/19/2000.

    Case No. 06-05-BZ48A issued 01/11/2007. 
(c)  Establishment of Floodplain Zoning Districts . The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
1.  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
2.  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
3.  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
(d)  Locating Floodplain Boundaries . Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection 1. or 2. below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 23.08 Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use/zoning compliance permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 23.07(3)(c) and the criteria in subsections 1. and 2. below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section 23.08 Amendments. 
1.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
2.  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(e)  Removal of Lands From Floodplain . Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section 23.08 Amendments. 
(f)  Compliance . Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated . Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. §13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. §30.2022, applies. 
(h)  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions . 
1.  The ordinance from which chapter is derived supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 61.35, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation . In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(j)  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability . The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter. 
(k)  Severability . Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages . The Washington County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

(a)  No permit or variance shall be issued for a non-residential structure designed to be watertight below the regional flood elevation until the applicant submits a plan certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures will protect the structure or development to the flood protection elevation and submits a FEMA Floodproofing Certificate. 
(b)  For a structure designed to allow the entry of floodwaters, no permit or variance shall be issued until the applicant submits a plan either: 
1.  Certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or 
2.  Meets or exceeds the following standards: 
a.  A minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(c)  Floodproofing measures shall be designed, as appropriate, to: 
1.  Withstand flood pressures, depths, velocities, uplift and impact forces and other regional flood factors; 
2.  Protect structures to the flood protection elevation; 
3.  Anchor structures to foundations to resist flotation and lateral movement; 
4.  Minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters; and 
5.  Minimize or eliminate discharges into flood waters. 
(6)  PUBLIC INFORMATION. 
(a)  Place marks on structures to show the depth of inundation during the regional flood. 
(b)  All maps, engineering data and regulations shall be available and widely distributed. 
(c)  Real estate transfers should show what floodplain district any real property is in. 
(7)  PROCESSING AND REVIEW FEES . All property owners, developers, and other individuals or corporations (hereafter referred to collectively as "applicants") applying, petitioning, or appealing for the review, approval, or issuance of any permit, plan, variance, ordinance text amendment, or ordinance map amendment (hereafter referred to collectively as "permit application") pursuant to this chapter shall pay fees necessary to defray the total direct and indirect costs incurred by any and all Village department staff, elected officials and appointed commissions, legal counsel, consultants, and other representatives or professionals employed or otherwise retained by the Village to process, review, inspect, record, or take any other administrative or enforcement action pertaining to or resulting from the disposition of such permit application (hereafter referred to collectively as "processing costs"). 
The processing costs associated with each permit application may include, but are not limited to, the cost of time spent by Village department staff to meet with and otherwise communicate with applicants, review plans and process permits, prepare staff reports and recommendations, site and/or compliance inspections, document recording and copying costs, public hearing notice publishing and posting costs, etc. 
Because the processing costs associated with each permit application can vary, the Village will require each applicant to submit a flat fee and/or fee deposit in an amount deemed reasonable and necessary by the Village to cover the Village's processing costs for each permit application. Fees and fee deposits shall be submitted when a permit application is submitted to the Village. Fee deposits shall be made into a non interest-bearing "escrow account" from which the Village may make periodic withdrawals to defray processing costs as they are accrued during the course of processing and reviewing each permit application. 
Flat fees and the hourly rates used in the determination of costs associated with Village department staff time shall be established by resolution of the Village Board. Processing and review fee "escrow account" deposit amounts for each permit application required under this section shall be determined by the Village Planner/Zoning Administrator. In the event that the processing costs for a particular permit application are expected to (or have) exceeded a fee deposit prior to final disposition of a permit application, an additional escrow account fee deposit in an amount to be determined by the Village Planner/Zoning Administrator may be required prior to any further processing of said permit application at the discretion of the Village. Fee deposits, or portions thereof, that remain in a permit application escrow account after said permit application has been processed or withdrawn shall be returned to the applicant.

(71)  REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
(72)  START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(73)  STRUCTURE. Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.

State Law reference- Zoning of wetlands in shorelands, Wis. Stats. § 61.351. 

24.01 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND TITLE. 
(1)  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§61.35, 61.351, 87.30 and 144.26, Wis. Stats. 
(2)  FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the pollution of the navigable waters of the Village of Germantown would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to: 
(a)  Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. 
(b)  Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands. 
(c)  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters. 
(d)  Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat. 
(e)  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area. 
(f)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth-moving activities. 
(3)  TITLE. The title of this chapter shall be the "Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Code for the Village of Germantown, Wisconsin". 
24.02 - GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
(1)  COMPLIANCE. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the Village shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, State or Federal regulations, subject to the provisions of section 24.05 of this chapter, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a building permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter. 
(2)  MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if §13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of State highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when §30.12(4)(a), Wis. Stats., applies. 
(3)  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. 
(a)  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §61.35 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(4)  INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Village and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wis. Adm. Code NR 117, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Adm. Code NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(5)  SEVERABILITY. Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(6)  ANNEXED AREAS. The Washington County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of any future annexation shall remain in effect and be administered by the Village for all areas annexed by the Village after May 7, 1982. The Washington County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this subsection and are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator.

24.04 - SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING DISTRICT. 
(1)  SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING MAPS. The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this chapter and are on file in the office of the Village Clerk. 
(a)  Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Maps stamped "FINAL" on July 1, 1987. 
(b)  Floodplain Insurance Study Maps dated May 3, 1982. 
(c)  Zoning maps titled "Village of Germantown Zoning Maps" and dated January 15, 1988. 
(2)  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. 
(a)  The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the Village which are 5 acres or more and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made a part of this chapter and which are: 
1.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. lakes, ponds and flowages in the Village shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the Department publication, "Surface Water Resources of Washington County," or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. 
2.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in subsection (1) above shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
(b)  All wetlands shown on the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map (with a revised date of 4/23/2003) and other maps in subsection (1) above that are less than 5 acres where the location and extent are field verified with an appropriate wetland boundary determination approved by the Department of Natural Resources or Army Corps of Engineers using DNR-approved procedures. (Cr. Ord. #23-07) 
(c)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. (Rltd. Ord. #23-07) 
(d)  Exemptions. (Cr. Ord. #16-11) When the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) determines that a wetland is an "artificial wetland" and exempt from State and Federal wetland permits, the following artificial wetlands are exempt from the provisions of this section unless the DNR determines that the artificial wetland has significant functional values or uses pursuant to NR 103.03(1)(e), (f) or (g), Wis. Adm. Code: 
1.  Sedimentation and stormwater detention basins and associated conveyance features operated and maintained only for sediment detention and flood storage purposes. 
2.  Active sewage lagoons, cooling ponds, waste disposal pits, fish rearing ponds and landscape ponds. 
3.  Actively maintained drainage and roadside ditches. 
4.  Wetlands within active nonmetallic mining operations. 
(e)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary shown on the Official Zoning Maps and actual field conditions at the time the Maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary, as mapped, is in error. If the Department staff concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. Wetlands shown on the maps in subsection (1) above shall be prima facie evidence as to the existence, location and type of such wetlands. The presence or absence of a wetland on said official maps does not represent a definitive determination as to whether or not a wetland subject to the provisions of this Code is present. Wetlands identified during site specific delineation activities conducted pursuant to proposed site development and/or land divisions as required by the Village but that do not appear on the official maps are still subject to the provisions of this Code. (Rltd. and Am. Ord. #23-07; Rltd. Ord. #16-11)

Within 10 days a certified copy of the minutes of the Village Board meeting and a copy of the permit including conditions imposed, if granted, shall be sent to the appropriate district office of the Department. 
(5)  PROCESSING AND REVIEW FEES. (Am. Ord. #34-89; Am. Ord. #39-04; Am. Ord. #03-07) All property owners, developers, and other individuals or corporations (hereafter referred to collectively as "applicants") applying, petitioning, or appealing for the review, approval, or issuance of any permit, plan, variance, ordinance text amendment, or ordinance map amendment (hereafter referred to collectively as "permit application") pursuant to this chapter shall pay fees necessary to defray the total direct and indirect costs incurred by any and all Village department staff, elected officials and appointed commissions, legal counsel, consultants, and other representatives or professionals employed or otherwise retained by the Village to process, review, inspect, record, or take any other administrative or enforcement action pertaining to or resulting from the disposition of such permit application (hereafter referred to collectively as "processing costs"). 
The processing costs associated with each permit application may include, but are not limited to, the cost of time spent by Village department staff to meet with and otherwise communicate with applicants, review plans and process permits, prepare staff reports and recommendations, site and/or compliance inspections, document recording and copying costs, public hearing notice publishing and posting costs, etc. 
Because the processing costs associated with each permit application can vary, the Village will require each applicant to submit a flat fee and/or fee deposit in an amount deemed reasonable and necessary by the Village to cover the Village's processing costs for each permit application. Fees and fee deposits shall be submitted when a permit application is submitted to the Village. Fee deposits shall be made into a non interest-bearing "escrow account" from which the Village may make periodic withdrawals to defray processing costs as they are accrued during the course of processing and reviewing each permit application. 
Flat fees and the hourly rates used in the determination of costs associated with Village department staff time shall be established by resolution of the Village Board. Processing and review fee "escrow account" deposit amounts for each permit application required under this section shall be determined by the Village Planner/Zoning Administrator. In the event that the processing costs for a particular permit application are expected to (or have) exceeded a fee deposit prior to final disposition of a permit application, an additional escrow account fee deposit in an amount to be determined by the Village Planner/Zoning Administrator may be required prior to any further processing of said permit application at the discretion of the Village. Fee deposits, or portions thereof, that remain in a permit application escrow account after said permit application has been processed or withdrawn shall be returned to the applicant. 
(6)  RECORDING. Where a building permit or a conditional use permit is approved, an appropriate record shall be made by the Zoning Administrator of the land use and structures permitted. 
(7)  REVOCATION. Where the conditions of a building permit or conditional use permit are violated, the permit shall be revoked by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Village Board, respectively. 
(8)  BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS. 
(a)  Membership . See section 1.30 of this Code. 
(b)  Powers and Duties . For the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals: 
1.  Shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
2.  May authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the dimensional terms of this chapter as shall not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions unique to a property, a literal enforcement of the chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, as defined in section 24.03(15) of this chapter. In the issuance of a variance, the purpose of the chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. The granting of a variance shall not have the effect of granting or extending any use of property which is prohibited in that zoning district by this chapter. 
(c)  Appeals to the Board . Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the Village affected by any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other administrative official. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the official whose decision is in question, and with the Board of Zoning Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the reasons for the appeal. The Zoning Administrator or other official whose decision is in question shall transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record on the matter appealed. 
(d)  Public Hearings . 
1.  Before making a decision on an appeal or application, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, within a reasonable period of time, hold a public hearing. The Board shall give public notice of the hearing by publishing a Class 2 notice under Ch. 985, Wis. Stats., specifying the date, time and place of the hearing and the matters to come before the Board. At the public hearing, any party may present testimony in person, by agent or by attorney. 
2.  A copy of such notice shall be mailed to the parties in interest and the appropriate district office of the Department at least 10 days prior to all public hearings on issues involving shoreland-wetland zoning. 
(e)  Decisions . 
1.  The final disposition of an appeal before the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be in the form of a written decision, made within a reasonable time after the public hearing and signed by the Board Chairperson. Such decision shall state the specific facts which are the basis of the Board's determination and shall either affirm, reverse or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed, in whole or in part, dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction or prosecution, or grant the application for a conditional use. 
2.  A copy of such decision shall be mailed to the parties in interest and the appropriate district office of the Department within 10 days after the decision is issued. 
24.07 - AMENDING SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING REGULATIONS.

(3)  In order to insure that this chapter will remain consistent with the shoreland protection objectives of §144.26, Wis. Stats., the Village Board may not rezone a wetland in a shoreland-wetland zoning district, or any portion thereof, where the proposed rezoning may result in a significant adverse impact upon any of the following wetland functions: 
(a)  Storm and flood water storage capacity; 
(b)  Maintenance of dry season stream flow or the discharge of groundwater to a wetland, the recharge of groundwater from a wetland to another area or the flow of groundwater through a wetland; 
(c)  Filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
(d)  Shoreline protection against erosion; 
(e)  Fish spawning, breeding, nursery or feeding grounds; 
(f)  Wildlife habitat; or 
(g)  Areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific interest, including scarce wetland types and habitat of endangered species. 
(4)  Where the district office of the Department determines that a proposed rezoning may have a significant adverse impact upon any of the criteria listed in subsection (3) above, the Department shall so notify the Village of its determination either prior to or during the public hearing held on the proposed amendment. 
(5)  The appropriate district office of the Department shall be provided with: 
(a)  A copy of the recommendation and report, if any, of the Plan Commission on a proposed text or map amendment within 10 days after the submission of those recommendations to the Village Board.

(2)  DESIGNATION. Historic status shall not be imposed on any property unless the owner is in agreement. For property owners choosing to pursue historic status, the Commission shall have the power, subject to section 26.06 of this chapter, to designate historic structures and historic sites and to recommend designation of historic districts within the Village limits. Such designations shall be made based upon criteria designated in section 26.04 of this chapter. All historic designations, including individual structures, sites and districts, shall be approved by the Village Board. Once designated, such historic structures, sites and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  REGULATION OF CONSTRUCTION, RECONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION AND DEMOLITION OF PROPERTIES WITH HISTORIC STATUS. 
(a)  No owner or person in charge of a historic structure, historic site or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the Historic Preservation Commission. Unless such certificate has been granted by the Commission, the Building Inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
(b)  Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the Commission, the Commission shall approve the application unless: 
1.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the improvement or site upon which said work is to be done. 
2.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district. 
3.  In the case of any property located in a historic district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district. 
4.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the Village. 
5.  The building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced without great difficulty and/or expense. 
6.  Whether retention of the building or structure would promote the general welfare of the people of the Village or State by encouraging the study of American history, architecture or design, or by developing an understanding of American culture and heritage. 
7.  In the case of a request for the demolition of a deteriorated building or structure, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to maintain the property in good repair. Provided, however, that the Commission shall approve the application if, in case of a request for a demolition permit, the denial of the permit would result in the loss of all reasonable and beneficial use of or return from the property. 
(c)  In addition, in determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the following standards: 
1.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
2.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
3.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
4.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
5.  Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
6.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence. 
7.  Chemical or physical treatment, such as sand-blasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken, using the gentlest means possible. 
8.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
9.  New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
10.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(d)  If the Commission determines that the application for a certificate of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or district and with the above guidelines, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. Upon issuance of such certificate, the building permit shall then be issued by the Building Inspector. The Commission shall make this decision within 45 days of the filing of the application. 
(e)  Agencies of the Village and all public utility and transportation companies undertaking projects affecting historic structures, historic sites or historic districts shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences, structures and buildings on property, easements or streets owned or franchised by the Village. 
(f)  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the Village. A building permit or other municipal permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the preservation of the certificate of appropriateness required for the proposed work. Insofar as they are applicable to a historic structure, historic site or improvement in a historic district designated under this chapter, any provision of the plumbing, electrical, building or housing codes of the Village shall apply unless waived by the appropriate State or Village officials. The Commission may support or propose such waivers before the appropriate State or Village appeals body. 
(g)  Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be started within 12 months after the issuance of the certificate and the work shall conform to the provisions of the certificate. The Village may inspect the work during and after construction in order to assure compliance. Failure to comply with a certificate of appropriateness or failure to obtain a certificate shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition to other penalties and remedies, the Village shall issue a stop work order and all work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. 
(h)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit. 
(4)  RECOGNITION OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES, SITES AND DISTRICTS. (Am. Ord. #22-08) At such time as a historic structure, site or district has been properly designated, the Commission will provide a suitable plaque declaring that such property is a historic structure, site or district. Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible. 
(5)  OTHER DUTIES. In addition to those duties already specified in this chapter, the Commission shall: 
(a)  Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the historical heritage of the Village and the historic properties designated under the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Cooperate with the State Historic Preservation Officer and the State Preservation Review Board in attempting to include such properties hereunder designated as landmarks or landmark sites or historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places and the State Register of Historic Places. 
(c)  As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the special Village account for such purposes. 
(6)  APPEAL PROCEDURE. 
(a)  Should the owner of a property dispute the actions of the Commission, the owner may appeal to the Village Board within 30 days. 
(b)  Should the Commission fail to issue a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant, within 30 days, may appeal such decision to the Village Board. In addition, if the Commission fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate within the guidelines of this chapter. 
(7)  APPLICATION FEE. (Am. Ord. #22-08; Am. Ord. #19-09) 
(a)  Upon submission of the application, an accompanying fee shall be paid to the Village by the property owner. 
(b)  Waiver of Permit Fes. After such a time that a historic structure or site has been properly designated, waiver of building permit fees shall be limited to the repair and restoration of the original exterior structure or site as long as the historic status is maintained. For new construction, all permit fees shall apply.

The Board shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses and records as deemed necessary. The Board may authorize an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission. 
c.  Within 10 working days after the close of the public hearing, the Board may designate the property as either a historic structure or historic site or recommend its inclusion in a historic district or rescind historic designation. Approval shall require a super-majority ( 2/3 ) vote. After designation or rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to the property owner. Notification shall also be given to the Village Clerk, the Building Inspector, the Planner and the Village Assessor. (Am. Ord. #22-08) 
(2)  ZONING OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES. Any historic structure, historic site or historic district zoned HD for historic preservation purposes shall be included as such on the Village Zoning Map. The HD zoning shall be in addition to the existing underlying land use Zoning. 
(3)  CREATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS. 
(a)  [ Criteria for Designation of Historic Districts .] For preservation purposes, the Historic Preservation Commission shall select geographically defined areas within the Village to be designated as historic districts and shall, with the assistance of the Planning Department, prepare a historic preservation plan in ordinance form for each area. A historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the Village which: 
1.  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, State or community; or 
2.  Is identified with historic personages or with important events in national, State or local history; or 
3.  Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of architectural types or specimens inherently valuable for the study of a period or periods, styles, methods of construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or 
4.  Is representative of the noticeable works of master builders, designers or architects who influenced their age. Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the Historic Preservation Commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development and a statement of preservation objectives. 
(b)  [ Guideline Criteria in Development of Historic District Plans .] Guideline criteria to be considered in the development of historic district plans are as follows: 
1.  All new structures shall be constructed to a height visually compatible with the building and environment with which they are visually related. 
2.  The gross volume of any new structure shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
3.  In the street elevation of a building, the proportion between the width and height in the facade should be visually compatible with the building and environment with which it is visually related. 
4.  The proportions and relationships between doors and windows in the street facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
5.  The rhythm of solids to voids, created by openings in the facade, should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
6.  The existing rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them should be preserved. 
7.  The materials used in the final facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
8.  The texture inherent in the facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
9.  Colors and patterns used on the facade (especially trim) should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
10.  The design of the roof should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
11.  The landscape plan should be sensitive to the individual building, its occupants and their needs. Further, the landscape treatment should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
12.  The street facade should blend with other buildings via directional expression. When adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or vertical expression, this expression should be carried over and reflected.

(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life: control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
(3)  Control exceedances of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
27.02 - AUTHORITY. (Am. Ord. #07-14) 
(1)  This chapter is adopted by the Village of Germantown under the authority granted by §61.354, Wis. Stats., for villages. This chapter supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under §61.35, Wis. Stats., that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in §61.354, Wis. Stats., §61.35, Wis. Stats., applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body. 
(3)  The Village of Germantown shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  The requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: (Am. Ord. #22-10)

(b)  Ch. 13, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. 
27.03 - FINDINGS OF FACT. (Am. Ord. #07-14) 
The governing body finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(6)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(7)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.

The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that location. 
i.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, 10 feet. 
j.  Notwithstanding pars. "a" to "i", the greatest protective area width shall apply where rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands are contiguous. 
2.  Best management practices such as green infrastructure, filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area. 
3.  Other regulations, such as Ch. 30, Wis. Stats., and Wis. Adm. Code NR Chs. 103, 115, 116 and 117, and their associated review and approval process may apply in the protective area. 
4.  This paragraph does not apply to: 
a.  Structures constructed in accordance with §59.692(1v), Wis. Stats. 
(e)  Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance Areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the State contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
1.  A combination of the following BMPs may be used: oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup materials, or any other structural or nonstructural method of preventing or treating petroleum in runoff. 
(f)  Swale Treatment for Transportation Facilities. 
1.  Applicability. Except as provided in subparagraph 2., transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal meet all of the requirements of this section, if the swales are designed to the maximum extent practicable to do all of the following: 
a.  Be Vegetated. However, where appropriate, nonvegetative measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams. It is preferred that tall and dense vegetation be maintained within the swale due to its greater effectiveness at enhancing runoff pollutant removal. 
b.  Carry runoff through a swale for 200 feet or more in length that is designed with a flow velocity no greater than 1.5 feet per second for the peak flow generated using either a 2-year, 24-hour design storm or a 2-year storm with a duration equal to the time of concentration as appropriate. If a swale of 200 feet in length cannot be designed with a flow velocity of 1.5 feet per second or less, then the flow velocity shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. Check dams may be included in the swale design to slow runoff flows and improve pollutant removal. Transportation facilities with continuous features such as curb and gutter, sidewalks or parking lanes do not comply with the design requirements of this paragraph. However, a limited amount of structural measures such as curb and gutter may be allowed as necessary to account for other concerns such as human safety or resource protection. 
2.  Exemptions. The Village may, consistent with water quality standards, require other provisions of this section be met on a transportation facility with an average daily travel of vehicles greater than 2,500 and where the initial surface water of the State that the runoff directly enters is any of the following: 
a.  An outstanding resource water. 
b.  An exceptional resource water. 
c.  Waters listed in §303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act that are identified as impaired in whole or in part, due to nonpoint source impacts. 
d.  Waters where targeted performance standards are developed under Wis. Adm. Code NR §151.004, to meet water quality standards. 
(g)  Snow Storage Areas. Site plans shall designate snow storage areas. Snow storage shall be prohibited upon green infrastructure BMPs and prohibited upon all areas used for runoff infiltration. 
(4)  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ON-SITE AND OFF-SITE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT MEASURES. The following considerations shall be observed in managing runoff: 
(a)  Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this section. 
(b)  Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be provided to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream property or public safety. 
(c)  Private Drainage Easements. Private easements shall overlay all private storm sewers, ditches, and swales. All private drainage easements shall be labeled as "Private Drainage Easements" on plats of survey, site plans, and as-built drawings. 
(d)  Public Drainage Easements. Public easements shall overlay all public storm sewers, ditches, and swales not situated in Village-owned right-of-way. All public drainage easements shall be labeled as "Public Drainage Easements" on plats of survey, site plans, and as-built drawings. 
(5)  LOCATION AND REGIONAL TREATMENT OPTION. 
(a)  The BMPs may be located on-site, or off-site only as part of a regional stormwater device, practice or system, intended to serve a common entity. 
(b)  All commonly owned BMPs, (residential development, business or commercial districts, or other similar development where separate owners share a BMP), shall be located in an outlot. No BMP facilities and/or runoff from multiple properties may be directed or placed on any noncollectively owned private property or properties, except in cases in which easements and maintenance agreements are authorized by the Village Engineer and recorded at the Washington County Register of Deeds. 
(c)  Post-construction runoff within a water of the State that flows into a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not required to meet the performance standards of this chapter. Post-construction BMPs may be located in nonnavigable surface waters, provided all requirements of this chapter and Municipal Ord. No. 24 are met. 
(d)  Except as allowed under paragraph (e), post-construction runoff from new development shall meet the post-construction performance standards prior to entering a water of the State. 
(e)  Post-construction runoff from any development within a water of the State that flows into a BMP is not required to meet the performance standards of this chapter if: 
1.  The BMP was constructed prior to the effective date of this chapter and the BMP either received a permit issued under Ch. 30, Wis. Stats., or the BMP did not require a Ch. 30, Wis. Stats., permit; and 
2.  The BMP is designed to provide runoff treatment from future upland development. 
(f)  Runoff from existing development, redevelopment and in-fill areas shall meet the post-construction performance standards in accordance with this paragraph. 
1.  To the maximum extent practicable, BMPs shall be located to treat runoff prior to discharge. 
2.  Post-construction BMPs for such runoff may be located in a water of the State if allowable under all other applicable federal, state and local regulations such as Wis. Adm. Code NR Ch. 103, and Ch. 30, Wis. Stats. This allows the location of BMPs in waters of the State where necessary to augment management practices upstream of the navigable surface water to meet the performance standards. 
(g)  The discharge of runoff from a BMP, such as a wet detention pond or green infrastructure, or after a series of such BMPs is subject to this chapter. This section does not supersede any other applicable Federal, State or local regulation such as Wis. Adm. Code NR Ch. 103 and Ch. 30, Wis. Stats. 
(h)  The Village may approve off-site management measures provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The Village determines that the post-construction runoff is covered by a stormwater management plan that is approved by the Village and the MMSD, and that contains management requirements consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
2.  The off-site facility meets all of the following conditions: 
a.  The facility is in place. 
b.  The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the performance standards of this chapter. 
c.  The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and maintenance, and a corresponding Maintenance Declaration.

The Administering authority may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administering authority that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Administering authority within 72 hours of receipt of the prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(4)  SUSPENSION DUE TO ILLICIT DISCHARGES IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. The Administering authority may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the State. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Administering authority may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(5)  SUSPENSION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF ILLICIT DISCHARGE. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Administering authority will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Administering authority for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the Administering authority. 
28.15 - PENALTIES.
