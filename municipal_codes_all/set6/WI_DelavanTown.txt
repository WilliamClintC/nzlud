the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed
sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested

request for a record without a reasonable limitation
as to subject matter or length of time represented by
the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A
request may be made orally, but a request must be in
writing before an action to enforce the request is
commenced under Section 19.37, Wisconsin Statutes.
Except as provided below, no request may be refused
because the person making the request is unwilling to
be identified or to state the purpose of the request.
No request may be refused because the request is
received by mail unless prepayment of the fee is
required under Section 2.04 5) (iv) (vi) above. A

identification whenever the requested record is kept
at a private residence or whenever security reasons or
Federal law or regulations so require.

soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the
request or notify the requester of the authority’s
determination to deny the request, in whole or in
part, and the reasons therefore. If the legal
custodian, after conferring with the Town Attorney,
determines that a written request is so general as to
be unduly time consuming, the party making the request
may first be required to itemize his/her request in a
manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
3) LIMITATIONS
(a) A request for a record may be denied as provided in
Section 2.06 below. If a request is made orally, the
Revised 5/13/2019 12:33:00 PM
request may be denied orally unless a demand for a
written statement of the reasons denying the request
is made by the requester within five (5) business days
of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in
whole or in part, the requester shall receive a
written statement of the reasons for denying the
request. Every written denial of a request shall
inform the requester that the request for the record
was made in writing that the determination is subject
to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under
Section 19.37(1), Wisconsin Statutes or upon
application to the Attorney General or a district
attorney.

Revised 5/13/2019 12:33:00 PM
(a) In responding to a request for inspection or copying
of a legal record which is not specifically exempt
from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring
with the Town Attorney, may deny the request, in whole
or in part, only if he/she determines that the harm to
the public interest resulting from disclosure would
outweigh the public interest in full access to the
requested record. Examples of matters for which
disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited
to, the following:
i. Records obtained under official pledges of
confidentiality which were necessary and given in
order to obtain the information contained in them.

disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial
adverse effect upon the reputation of any person
referred to in such history or data.

and any officer, agent or employee of the Town when
advice is being rendered concerning strategy with

Revised 5/13/2019 12:33:00 PM
public and information that may not be made public,
the custodian of the record shall provide the
information that may be made public and delete the
information that may not be made public from the
record before release. The custodian shall confer
with the Town Attorney prior to releasing any such
record and shall follow the guidance of the Town
Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If,
in the judgment of the custodian and the Town
Attorney, there is no feasible way to separate the
exempt material from the nonexempt material without
unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt
material, the entire record shall be withheld from
disclosure.

3.04 TAX EXEMPT PROPERTY REGISTRATION
1) PURPOSE
(a) This ordinance sets forth procedures concerning
administration of the tax exempt property registration
system for reports.
2) DUTIES
(a) By July 1 of each even numbered year, the Town Clerk
must complete and deliver a Taxation District Summary
Report to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. This
report should summarize information provided by the
tax exempt property owners, with their report due
March 31 each even numbered year. The Clerk will make
a reasonably diligent effort to ensure that all tax
exempt property owners are sent the registration form,
and have returned the same. When said form has not
been received by the Clerk by March 31, said Clerk
shall send the property owner(s) a notice, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, stating that
Revised 1.3.2020
the property for which the form is required will be
appraised at the owner’s expense, and a forfeiture
imposed, if a completed form is not received by the
Clerk within thirty (30) days after the notice is
sent. The Clerk is responsible for form distribution
and review.
3) FEES
(a) Since administration time of an elected official, and
possibly other Town officer (Deputy Clerk) or
employees to whom duties are delegated by the Clerk is
involved, and since such workload is due to the
existence of tax exempt property within the Town, the
Town Board affirmatively states that it is fair and
logical to charge a fee, as authorized under state
law. After consideration of the administration time
involved, the number of parcels per tax exempt entity,
and expenses to the Town, such as postage, copies,
etc., the Board believes the following fee is
reasonable, to be charged per tax exempt entity per
parcel as follows:
i. Fifteen ($15) dollars when paid by March 31 of the
registration year
ii. Ten ($10) dollars late fee if not remitted by the
March deadline
4) LICENSING
(a) Prompt payment of fees shall be a condition of
receiving or renewing any license issued by the Town
to the tax exempt property owner, when applicable.
Timely submission of the required report is likewise a
licensing condition, and requires accurate
information.
5) FORFEITURE
(a) Since prompt and timely submission of these reports to
the Clerk is essential to the efficient operation of
this system, and compliance with state standards, a
forfeiture of twenty ($20) to two-hundred ($200)
dollars may be imposed by a court for failure to
submit the Report to the Town Clerk by the deadline
Revised 1.3.2020
set forth in Subsection 2) above. Enforcement may be
by use of the citation procedure separately adopted by
the Town ordinance. Pursuant to Section 70.337(6),

the expense of the owner.

(a) PURPOSE
i. The Town of Delavan has previously adopted a room
tax ordinance on December 18, 1984. It is the
intent of the Town Board that this ordinance not be
considered to be a new room tax, but rather, an
increase to an existing tax. Pursuant to Section
66.0615 (1m) (a), Wisconsin Statutes, the Town of
Delavan will allocate seventy percent (70%) of the
increase in room tax towards the promotion and
development of tourism. These funds shall be spent

(b) IMPLEMENTATION AND ALLOCATION OF ROOM TAX

tax is hereby imposed on the privilege of
furnishing, at retail, rooms or lodging to
transients by hotelkeepers, motel operations, and
other persons furnishing accommodations to the
public, irrespective of whether membership is
required for the use of accommodations. Such tax
shall be at the rate of eight (8%) percent of the
total room charges from such retail furnishing of
rooms or lodging. Such tax shall not be subject to
the selective sales tax imposed by Section 77.52(2)
(a) (1), Wisconsin Statutes. The proceeds of such
tax collected shall be apportioned as follows:

for purposes other than tourism promotion and
tourism development pursuant to Section
66.0615 (1m)(dm), Wisconsin Statutes.
2. From the amount retained by the Town of
Delavan for purposes other than tourism
promotion and tourism development, Eighty-nine
percent (89%) shall be allocated to the
Delavan Lake Water Quality Improvement Fund.

within the Town on or before the same date on which such tax
is due and payable. Every person required to file a quarterly
return shall also file an annual return on or before January
31 for the preceding calendar year.
4) The annual return shall summarize the quarterly returns,
reconcile and adjust for errors in the quarterly returns, and

permit for each place of business. Each application for a
permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the Town Board.
At the time of making an application the applicant shall pay
the Treasurer a fee of ten ($10) dollars for each permit.

place of business within the Town. Such permit is not

conspicuously displayed at the place for which it is issued.
Said permit shall not be issued until the applicant has
Revised 1.3.2020
complied with Subsection 4) and 12) herein.
7) When any person fails to comply with this section, the
Treasurer may, upon ten (10) days notification and after

his/her permit shall not be revoked; revoke or suspend any or
all of the permits held by such person under this ordinance.

issuance of a permit which has been previously suspended or
revoked.
9) If any person liable for any amount of tax under this
ordinance sells out his business, stock, goods or quits the
business, his successors or assigns shall be responsible for
any unpaid tax due under this ordinance.
10) The Treasurer may determine the tax required to be paid
to the Town or the refund due to any person under this
section. This determination may be made upon the basis of the
facts contained in the return being audited or on the basis of
any other information within the Treasurer’s possession.
11) If any person fails to file a return as required by this
ordinance, the Treasurer shall make an estimate of the amount
of his/her total room charges under Subsection 2). Such
estimate shall be made for the period for which such person
failed to make a return and shall be based upon state sales
tax records and memoranda. On the basis of this estimate, the
Treasurer shall compute and determine the amount required to
be paid to the Town.
12) All unpaid taxes under this ordinance shall bear interest
at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the due
date of the return until paid.

dollars late filing fee. In addition, the entire tax finally
determined shall be subject to a penalty of up to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the tax, exclusive of any interest or other
penalties. If a person fails to file a return when due or
files a false or fraudulent return with the intent in either
case to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this ordinance, a
penalty of fifty percent (50%) shall be added to the tax
required to be paid, exclusive of interest and other
penalties.

(b) Officers or agent of the Town as may be necessary to
enforce collection, provided, however, this section
shall not be construed to preclude an action at law or

operations or information obtained by an investigation of
records of any person upon whom a tax is imposed by this

expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or
disclosed in any return, or to permit any return or copy
thereof to be seen or examined by any persons, except as
provided in Subsection 13).
17) Any person who is subject to the tax imposed by this
section who fails to obtain a permit as required by Section
14, or who fails or refuses to permit the inspection of
his/her records by the Town Treasurer after such inspection
has been duly requested by the Town Treasurer, or who fails to
file a return as provided in this section, or who violates any
other provision of this section, shall be subject to the
penalties as set forth in Section 25.04 of the Municipal Code
of the Town of Delavan. Each day, or portion thereof, that
such violation continues is hereby deemed to constitute a
separate offense.

clause, phrase, or portion of this ordinance is for

such amount and manner as to allow a fire to develop
15 Revised 10.17.19
by any willful act or natural means in other than a
controlled manner. Residential, commercial,
agricultural and industrial storage and use areas
under supervised control and management where
combustible material are stored in the course of the
use of the premises and in keeping with good sound
fire-protection practices shall not be deemed a fire
hazard.
(e) Ground-level growth
i. In the further interests of general health, safety
and public welfare, the Town Board does hereby
ordain that the allowing of grass, weeds and other
natural, ground-level growth to grow to an
excessive height creates a hazard leading to
conditions constituting a fire hazard.
ii. Any owner and/or occupant of land located in the
Town who allows grass, weeds and other natural,
ground-level growth to grow to an excessive height
shall be required to cut same down to a height of
not more than 6 inches and, in the event of the
failure of such owner and/or occupant to cut such
growth, the Town, by its designated representatives
and/or agent, may enter upon the premises to cut
such grass, weeds and ground-level growth to such
height and to levy against the land on which this
is done all costs incurred by the Town for the
cutting required.
iii. In the event the owner and/or occupant is engaged
in a lawful enterprise requiring such plant life to
grow to an excessive height, it shall be the duty
of the owner and/or occupant to so advise the Town
and procure from it a letter of permission allowing
such excessive growth. The issuance of a letter of
permission shall in no means or manner absolve the
owner and/or occupant from complying with any and
all other regulations and ordinances of the Town or
laws of the state.
iv. The provisions of this section as set forth in
Subsection € I, ii and iii shall not be deemed to
affect the raising of agricultural crops on
agricultural lands of the growing of such plant
life as a part of any lawful commercial or
16 Revised 10.17.19
industrial enterprise.
(f) Without limiting the effect or application of any
other provision contained herein, the Town Board
and/or the Fire Chief may declare a fire emergency
when, in their discretion, they determined that
conditions occasioned by weather, continuous drought
or the presence of highly combustible or explosive
materials within the Town are such that any burning
may create an unreasonable risk of fire spreading out
of control or may otherwise present an unreasonable
risk of harm to persons or property. Under such
declaration of emergency, all outside fires of nay
type shall be prohibited. Upon declaring a fire
emergency, the Town Board and/or Fire Chief shall take
such measures as they deem best suited to communicate
the state of fire emergency to the public, including,
but not by way of limitation, posted notices and
newspaper, television and radio announcements.
(g) Any person violating the conditions of a state of fire
emergency declared under Subsection (f) above shall be
subject to a penalty as provided in section 5.16 for
each violation.

Town. The petition shall be heard by the Highway
Committee, which shall grant or deny such petition.
The Highway Committee may consider the following
factors in determining whether to grant or deny such
petition:
(b) EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
i. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or
unusual circumstances applying to the lot or
parcel that does not apply generally to other
properties in the Town and the granting of
variance would not be of such a general or
recurrent nature as to suggest that the driveway
specifications herein should be changed.
(c) ABSENT OF DETERMINT
i. The variance will not create substantial
detriment to any adjacent property and will not
materially impair or be contrary to the purpose
and spirit of this ordinance or the public
interest.
(d) UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP
i. The applicant must demonstrate that literal
enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance
will result in unnecessary hardship to the
applicant; and the hardship is due to special
Revised 10/3/2018
conditions unique to the property. No variance
shall be granted solely on the basis of economic
gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships will not be
considered as adequate grounds for the granting
of a variance.
(e) SAFETY TO PUBLIC OR GOVERNMENTAL PERSONNEL
i. The degree, to which the variance will affect the
safety of the public or of governmental
personnel, or the ability of governmental
personnel, especially police, fire and rescue
personnel, to execute their duties.
5) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Highway
Committee may appeal to the Town Board, within thirty (30)

10.22 CHILD SAFETY ZONES
1) Purpose; findings
This section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the
health and safety of children in the Town of Delavan form the
risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations
where children are present and tend to congregate. The Town
finds and declares the sex offenders are a serious threat to
public safety. When convicted sex offenders re-enter society,
they are much more likely than any other type of offender to
be re-arrested for a new sexual assault. Given the high rate
of recidivism of sex offenders and that reducing opportunity
and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of
recidivism, there is a need to protect children where they
congregate or play in public places in addition to the
protections afforded by state law near schools, day-care
centers and other places frequented by children. The Town
finds and declares that in addition to schools and day-care
centers, children congregate or play at public parks.

Revised
3) DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF LANDS
(a) STREETS, HIGHWAYS, AND DRAINAGEWAYS
i. Whenever a tract of land to be divided within the
jurisdiction of this Ordinance encompasses all or
any part of an arterial or collector street,
drainageway, or other public way which has been
designated on a duly adopted Town or regional
comprehensive plan or comprehensive plan component,
said public way shall be made a part of the plat and
dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the
locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or
component and as set forth in Section 9 of this
Ordinance.
ii. Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided, developed
by condominium or planned development embraces all
or any part of a proposed public playground, park,
school site, open space site, or other public land,
other than streets, highways, drainageways, other
public ways or public access to navigable lakes or
streams designated in the adopted regional and County
comprehensive plans or adopted plan components of
Walworth County, or other adopted Town of Delavan
plan, these proposed public lands shall be made a
part of the plat, condominium or planned development.
The subdivider or developer shall reserve such
proposed public lands for a period not to exceed three
(3) years, unless extended by mutual agreement, for
acquisition by the public agency having jurisdiction.
iii. Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided, developed
as a condominium or planned development embraces any
part of existing floodlands, such floodlands shall
be made a part of the plat, condominium or planned
development. Floodlands included within a
subdivision plat shall be included within lots, or
reserved for acquisition as provided above, or if
approved by the Town Plan Commission, shall be
reserved in perpetuity for the recreational use of
the future residents of the land to be divided or
developed.
4) IMPROVEMENTS
(a) Before final approval of any plat, condominium or
planned development located within the jurisdictional
limits of this Ordinance, the subdivider shall install
Revised
street and utility improvements as hereinafter provided.
If such improvements are not installed as required at
the time that the final plat or plan is submitted for
approval, the subdivider shall, before the recording
of the plat, enter into a contract with the Town agreeing
to install the required improvements and shall file with
said contract a bond or letter of credit meeting the
approval of the Town Attorney or a certified check in
an amount equal to the estimated cost of the
improvements--said estimate to be made by the Town Plan
Commission after review and recommendation by the Town
Engineer--as a guarantee that such improvements will
be completed by the subdivider or his subcontractors
not later than one (1) year from the date of recording
of the plat and as a further guarantee that all
obligations to subcontractors for work on the
development are satisfied. In addition:
i. Contracts and contract specifications for the
construction of street and utility improvements on
dedicated street right-of-way, as well as the
contractors and subcontractors providing such work
shall be subject to the approval of the Town Board.
ii. Governmental units to which these bond and contract
provisions apply may file, in lieu of said contract
and bond, a letter from officers authorized to act
on their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions
of this section.

within the Town, the subdivider shall install survey
monuments placed in accordance with the requirements
of Chapter 236.15 of the Wisconsin Statutes, and as
may be required by the Town Engineer.
5) VARIANCES
(a) Where, in the judgment of the Town Plan Commission, it
would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions
of Sections 9.0 and Appendix B of this Ordinance because
exceptional or undue hardship would result, the Town
Plan Commission may waive or modify any requirement to
the extent deemed just and proper. No variance to the
provisions of this Ordinance shall be granted unless
the Town Plan Commission finds by the greater weight
of the evidence that all the following facts and
conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its
proceedings:
Revised
i. EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: There are exceptional,
extraordinary, or unusual circumstances or
conditions where a literal enforcement of the
requirements of this Ordinance would result in severe
hardship. (Such hardship should not apply generally
to other properties or be of such a recurrent nature
as to suggest that the Land Division Ordinance should
be changed).
ii. PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS: That such variance
is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property rights possessed by other
properties in the same vicinity.
iii. ABSENCE OF DETRIMENT: That the variance will not
create substantial detriment to adjacent property
and will not materially impair or be contrary to the
purpose and spirit of this Ordinance or the public
interest.
(b) A simple majority vote of the entire membership of the
Town Plan Commission shall be required to grant any
modification of this Ordinance.
(c) The Town Board may waive the placing of monuments,
required under Sec. 236.15(1)(b), (1)(c), and (1)(d),
for a reasonable time on condition that the subdivider
execute a surety bond to insure the placing of such
monuments within the required time limits established
by the Town.
6) LAND SUITABILITY
(a) No land shall be subdivided, developed as a condominium
or planned development for any use which is determined
to be unsuitable for such use by the Town Plan Commission
for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse
soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any
other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety,
or welfare of the future residents of the proposed
subdivision, condominium, or planned development or of
the Town. In addition:

natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into
building sites to be served by onsite soil absorption
sewage disposal systems.

natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into
building sites to be served by on-site soil absorption
sewage disposal systems.
vii. Lands covered by soils having a percolation rate
slower than sixty (60) minutes per inch or faster
than ten (10) minutes per inch shall not be divided
into building sites to be served by onsite soil
absorption sewage disposal systems.

of this section, shall in writing recite the particular
facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land
is unsuitable for any use and afford the subdivider an
opportunity to present evidence in rebuttal to such
finding of unsuitability if they so desire. Thereafter
the Town Plan Commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw
Revised
its determination of unsuitability.

failure to approve a plat may appeal such objection or
failure to approve as provided in Sections 236.13(5)

or objecting agency is arbitrary, unreasonable or
discriminatory.

subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these
regulations, the comprehensive plan, comprehensive plan
components, neighborhood plans, and duly adopted plan
implementation devices of the Town and to otherwise
assist the subdivider in planning his development. In
so doing, both the subdivider and planning agency may
reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program
and objectives of the proposed development and its
possible adverse effects on the neighborhood and
community. The subdivider will gain a better
understanding of the subsequent required procedures.
2) CONCEPTUAL PLAN
(a) It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an

development and its possible adverse effects on the
adjacent neighborhood and community.
3) PRELIMINARY PLAT REVIEW
(a) Before submitting a Final Plat for approval, the
subdivider shall prepare a Preliminary Plat with
supporting data and a letter of application. The

within their jurisdiction. Their recommendations shall
be transmitted to the Town Plan Commission within 20
days from the date the Plat is filed. The Preliminary
Plat and supporting data shall then be reviewed by the
Town Plan Commission and Town Engineer for conformance
with this Ordinance and all ordinances, rules,
regulations, comprehensive plans and comprehensive plan

Commission shall then recommend approval, conditional
approval or rejection of the Preliminary Plat to the
Town Board.
4) PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL

and if approved conditionally or rejected, a letter
setting forth the conditions of approval or the
reasons for rejection shall accompany the Plat. One
(1) copy each of the Plat and letter shall be placed
in the Town Board's permanent file.
ii. Failure of the Town Board to act within ninety (90)
days or within the time as extended by agreement with
the subdivider shall constitute an approval of the
Plat as filed.
iii. Approval or conditional approval of a Preliminary
Plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the
Final Plat, except that if the Final Plat is submitted
within three (3) months of preliminary plat approval
and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat
layout as indicated in Section 236.11(1)(b) Wisconsin
Statutes, the Final Plat shall be entitled to approval
with respect to such layout. The Preliminary Plat
and supporting data shall be deemed an expression

1.14 WAIVER OF DESIGN STANDARDS
1) Where conditions so warrant; the Town Plan Commission of the
Town of Delavan may consider waiving any of the requirements
found in these standards upon appeal by the Subdivider, per
Section 2.5 of the Land Division Ordinance.
SECTION 2.0 EROSION CONTROL
2.1 INTRODUCTION
1) Project construction required in connection with a development
often occurs in or adjacent to areas with existing surface or
underground improvements. The intent of this Section 2 is to
specify Town requirements relative to construction affecting
existing and future improvements. Drawings and specifications
presented for Town approval shall provide for the
implementation of the requirements of this Section.
2.2 EROSION CONTROL
1) Erosion and sediment control due to run off, equipment leaving
and entering a construction site, wind, etc., are required for
all construction. Site engineering or grading plans for
projects shall either contain specific provisions for erosion
control or a separate erosion control plan. The provisions or
plan will follow accepted techniques and details as delineated
by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Walworth
County Land Use and Resources Management Office, or as
directed by the Town Engineer.
2) For Erosion Control measures during building construction, see
Town of Delavan Municipal Code, Ordinance No. 23.
3) Steep slopes (exceeding 4:1) are to be avoided whenever
possible. As much natural vegetation as possible; should be
retained especially next to lakes, creeks, or other natural
water sources.
4) The erosion control plan should indicate the location of soil
stockpiles that are to remain onsite longer than four (4)
weeks.
5) Erosion control measures should be used which include but are
not limited to sediment traps, sediment basins, diversion
channels, gravel access roads at all construction entrances
and pavement cleaning operations, storm drain inlet
protection, silt fences, straw bales, and any other measures
necessary or as directed by the Town Engineer.
6) All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical
sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one
time.
7) Water pumped from the site shall be treated in temporary
sedimentation basins, or by other appropriate practices as
indicated in the "Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management
Handbook”.
8) All waste and unused building materials including garbage,
debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or
hazardous materials shall be properly disposed of and not be
allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or
storm sewer system.
2.3 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
1) On-site sediment control measures shall be constructed and
functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping,
excavating or fill activities on the site, meeting the
requirements of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,
Walworth County Land Use & Resource Management Office, and the
Town Engineer including:
(a) Filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales,
or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed
to control all off-site runoff. Vegetated filter
strips, with a minimum width of twenty-five (25’)
feet, may be used as an alternative only where runoffs
in sheet flow is expected. Silt filter fences and
straw bales shall be inspected weekly and after
rainfall events for repair or replacement. Straw
bales shall be replaced as a minimum, every three (3)
months.
(b) Sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be
constructed at the down slope point of the disturbed
area.
(c) Temporary sediment basin or equivalent control measure
shall be constructed at the down slope point of the
disturbed area.
2) Sediment basin design shall provide for both detention storage
and sediment storage. The sediment basin shall be designed as
specified by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
Walworth County Land Use & Resource Management Office and the
Town Engineer.
3) Disturbed areas shall be stabilized within seven (7) days with
any of the temporary or permanent measures defined in this
section.
4) Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the
site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical.
Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not
erode the conveyance and receiving channels, or neighboring
properties.
5) Any required disturbance of stream channels shall be restabilized
within forty-eight (48) hours of disturbance.
2.4 MAINTENANCE OF CONTROL MEASURES
1) All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to
meet the requirements of this ordinance shall be maintained
periodically by the applicant or subsequent land owner during
the period of land disturbance and development of the site in
a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance.
2) At the completion of any project, the storm sewers, culverts,
gutters, etc., will be inspected by the Town Engineer to
determine if removal of trapped sediment is required.
3) Once all disturbed areas have been vegetated, the erosion
control measures shall be removed. Temporary sedimentation
basins shall be removed at the time of project completion and
as directed by the Town Engineer.
2.5 INSPECTION
1) The Town shall make periodic inspections and shall either
approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the
permittee wherein the work fails to comply with erosion and
sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for grading,
stripping, excavating, and filling work approved by the Town
shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work.
Inspections can take place during any or all of the following:
(a) Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff
control measures (including perimeter controls and
diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth
disturbance or grading;
(b) After stripping and clearing;
(c) After rough grading;
(d) After final grading;
(e) After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and
(f) After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to
removal of sediment controls.
2.6 SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
1) If at any stage of the grading of any development site the
Town determines by inspection that the nature of the site is
such that further work authorized by an existing permit is
likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake,
wetland, or drainage structure, the Town may require, as a
condition of allowing the work to be done, that such
reasonable special precautions to be taken as is considered
advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special
Precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, a more
level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing,
installation of plant materials for erosion control, and
recommendations of a soils engineer which may be made
requirements for further work.
2) Where it appears that storm damage may result because the
grading on any development site is not complete, work may be
stopped and the permittee required to install temporary
structures or take such other measures as may be required to
protect adjoining property or the public safety. In large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the
Town may specify the time of starting of grading and time of
completion or may require that the operations be conducted in
specific stages so as to insure completion of protective
measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
2.7 PROTECTION OF PROPERTY AND SURFACE STRUCTURES
1) Trees, shrubbery, fences, poles and all other property and
surface structures shall be protected during construction
operations. Any fences, poles or other man made surface
improvements which are moved or disturbed shall be restored to
their original condition, after construction is completed. A
tree preservation plan may be required for all areas of a
project that will be affected by the development activity.
The plan shall show the location and trunk diameter of all
trees of a diameter breast height of ten (10”) inches and
larger. The plan shall be taken to the extent practicable to
preserve healthy trees over ten (10”) inches DBH. Any trees,
shrubbery or other vegetation which are approved for removal
shall be removed completely, including stumps and roots.
2) Where trees which are to remain, proper care should be taken
during excavation operations. Do not machine excavate in the
"Root Protection Zone" defined as a circle around the tree
with a radius equal to one (1’) foot for every inch of tree
diameter. Roots encountered outside this zone which are over
two (2”) inch diameter shall not be cut unless approved by the
Town Engineer. Tree tunneling, where necessary, shall be
determined by the Town Engineer. Shrub and tree limbs shall
be tied back to prevent loss or damage. Any damaged limbs and
branches shall be pruned and sealed. Spoil banks shall be
removed by hand from around trees to prevent damage to trunks
by construction machinery.
3) Trees and shrubs which cannot be protected or are damaged
during construction shall be replaced in kind or replace four
(4’) inch diameter and larger trees with one(1) four (4”) inch
diameter size tree for each six (6”) inch of original tree
diameter or fraction thereof. Replacement species shall be
approved by the Town.

SECTION 5.0 STORM WATER DRAINAGE
5.1 INTRODUCTION
1) All developments, regardless of size within limits or under
the control of the Town, shall include provisions for the
construction of storm water drainage facilities designed in
accordance with this Section. The design of all storm water
drainage facilities proposed for construction as independent
projects under the control of the Town shall also meet the
technical requirements of this Section.
2) Storm water drainage improvements shall also comply with the
requirements of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,
Walworth County Land Use & Resource Management Office, and the
Town Engineer.
5.2 GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1) SURFACE FLOW
(a) Surface swales/ditches described in Section 5.4(3),
shall be encouraged for use as designed in accordance
with the requirements of this Section. Swales shall
be constructed on rear and side lot lines to intercept
and transport storm waters so as to reduce the impact
on adjacent lots and lands. Natural swales and
depressional storage areas shall be incorporated into
storm water facilities design wherever practicable.
Swales and ditches, together with any underground
storm sewer system, shall provide an adequate outfall
for runoff from the one-hundred (100) year frequency
twenty-four (24) hour duration rainstorm. In areas
where swales/ditches can not be provided, the
underground storm sewer system shall be designed for
the one-hundred (100) year storm condition.
2) STORM SEWER
(a) Where allowed or required by the Town Engineer, storm
sewers may be constructed to drain the development and
any contiguous drainage area.
3) STORM WATER DETENTION
(a) Storm water detention facilities are required for all
subdivisions, condominiums or planned developments.
(b) Storm water detention for residential subdivisions
with individual lot sizes of three (3) acres or more
may not be required to provide storm water detention
if such development will not result in exceeding the
capacities of downstream existing drainage ways,
endanger downstream properties, or degrade the quality
of downstream waters, as determined by the Town.
(c) Detention facilities shall be installed after all
necessary erosion control measures have been provided
and prior to any land disturbing activities.
4) DRAINAGE BASIN DIVIDES
(a) The design of storm water drainage systems shall not
result in the inter-basin transfer of drainage, unless
no reasonable alternative exists and there is no legal
restraint to prevent such transfer.
5) LOT GRADING
(a) The proposed finished yard grade, rear and side yard
swales, and the location and top of foundation
elevation for all proposed structures shall be shown
on a lot grading plan. Generally, the top of
foundation of any structure must be constructed at
least eight (8”) inches above the proposed finished
yard grade and approximately eighteen (18”) inches
above the centerline (or back of curbs) of the
abutting street. Where foundations are lower than the
street centerline, or in the case of depressed
driveways, alternate means of surface drainage
diversion must be shown to avoid structure flooding.
Sufficient finished grade elevations must be shown on
the drawings to ensure positive drainage away from
each structure.
5.3 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER DETENTION
1) GENERAL
(a) In concept, a detention basin shall have a high water
level, with one (1’) foot of freeboard, based on a
one-hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design
storm and shall have an outlet which allows runoff no
greater than that for the land in its natural state
prior to development.
2) RELEASE RATES
(a) The allowable release rates for the two (2) year, ten
(10) year, and one hundred (100) year frequency,
twenty-four (24) hour duration rainstorms shall be no
greater than that for the land in its natural state
prior to development.
3) DESIGN CALCULATIONS
(a) The design of storm water detention facilities shall
be based on runoff hydrographs from the two (2) year,
ten (10) year and one hundred (100) year frequency,
twenty-four (24) hour duration rainstorms. The
modified rational formula shall not be used for
development of hydrographs. All design rainfall
events shall be based on the “Point Rainfall
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Relationships for
Milwaukee, Wisconsin”, as prepared by “Southeastern
Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission”. All design
computations which do not rely on continuous
accounting of antecedent soil moisture conditions
shall assume "Wet" conditions.
(b) Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the site
shall be considered in the equations for the design of
the project site's drainage system. If the tributary
areas are undeveloped or do not meet release rate
requirements, the subdivider may bypass all tributary
area flows around rather than through the storage
facility. Runoff calculations for all undeveloped
tributary land shall assume a reasonable fully
developed land cover based on anticipated zoning.
4) WATER QUALITY DESIGN
(a) Detention basins shall be designed to provide for the
reduction of sediments. Design shall meet Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources and Walworth county
requirements, and the design standards herein.

(a) The use of wet-bottom detention basins shall be
encouraged and designed to be safe, aesthetically
pleasing, and available for recreational use. Wet
bottom basins shall be at least three feet (3') deep,
excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish
habitat is provided, at least twenty-five percent
(25%) of the basin bottom shall be a minimum of ten
(10') feet deep. Wet bottom basins shall be designed
to remove storm water pollutants and sediments and
designed in such a manner to reduce nuisance problems
such as embankment erosion and algae. Embankments
above normal water levels shall be either terraced or
sloped at a maximum of 4:1. A safety ledge is
required no greater than two feet six inches (2'-6")
below the normal water level. Such ledges shall be no
less than six (6’) feet wide and shall back pitch
toward the basin embankment.
(b) Dry bottom detention basins shall be designed to be
safe, aesthetically pleasing and available for
multiple uses. Dry bottom detention basins shall be
designed and sized such that a minimum of eighty
percent (80%) of the bottom area shall have standing
water no longer than seventy-two (72) hours for the
one-hundred (100) year frequency storm. The basin
shall have a minimum slope of one percent (1%), and a
maximum embankment slope of twenty percent (20%).
6) OUTLET
(a) All concentrated storm water discharges leaving a site
must be directed into a well defined receiving channel
or pipe with adequate capacity for safe conveyance of
flows from all design events.
(b) Single pipe outlets shall have a minimum inside
diameter of twelve (12”) inches. If design release
rates call for smaller outlets, structures such as
perforated risers, flow control orifices, etc., shall
be used.
5.4 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR SURFACE SWALES AND STORM SEWERS
1) STORM SEWER
(a) When storm sewer construction is permitted or
required, storm sewers shall be designed to flow full,
using “Manning's Formula” with an appropriate
roughness coefficient based on pipe material. If a
storm sewer is designed with a constantly submerged
outfall, the sewer shall be designed using the
"Hydraulic Gradient" with the maximum allowable water
level an elevation one (1”) foot below centerline of
pavement.
(b) The rational method shall be employed when computing
storm runoff. The storm system shall be designed with
"Positive Street and Swale Drainage" such that storm
water runoff will be directed overland to the storm
water detention area in a manner to minimize property
damage due to flooding.
(c) Storm sewers shall be designed for a minimum five (5)
year storm event flowing full and have a maximum
velocity not to exceed ten (10') feet per second.
(d) In areas where curb and gutter and storm sewers are
approved, inlets shall be installed so that the
distance between each inlet shall not exceed four
hundred (400') feet and each inlet drains a maximum
street gutter length of four hundred (400') feet.
Where the inlet is located at a low point, additional
inlets may be required by the Town Engineer. No more
than two (2) inlets shall be interconnected. Inlets
shall be so located those storm water runoffs will not
"Pond" greater than the top of the street curbs.
Depressed street crowns to facilitate drainage will
not be permitted.
(e) Rear lot drainage should not drain over the curb.
Yard inlets shall be placed where approved or as
required by the Town Engineer.
(f) The minimum size storm sewer or inlet connection shall
be twelve (12") inches in diameter.
(g) Unless otherwise approved by the Town Engineer, storm
sewers shall be reinforced concrete pipe conforming to
ASTM C76 minimum Class III with O-ring joints
conforming to ASTM C443. All inlet connections shall
be concrete sewer pipe, ASTM C14 for extra strength
pipe.
(h) Minimum cover shall be generally three (3') feet for
all storm sewers unless special precautions are taken
to protect the pipe, as approved by the Town Engineer.
(i) All manholes, inlet manholes, inlets and catch basins,
and headwalls shall be designed in accordance with the
standard details of the Town.
(j) Connections to sanitary sewers or existing
agricultural drainage systems (tiles) will not be
permitted for any new developments. All developments
will utilize separate drainage systems to avoid
disruption or overloading of the existing agricultural
tile drainage system. Any field tile systems cut
during the process of land development must be
reconnected. Connection of existing agricultural
drain tiles to new storm water management systems may
be approved if proper allowance for flows from said
tiles is incorporated in the new design system.

5) DETAILED ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS
(a) To implement the purposes set forth in Section 22.02,
the following architectural criteria and review
guidelines are established:
i. BUILDING FACADES
1. For retail business, service, residential and
offices uses all building exteriors shall be
brick, decorative masonry, glass panel, or
other appropriate finished facade as may be
approved by the Plan Commission and Town
Board. Colors need to be shown and material
samples need to be submitted as requested by
the Town Planner, Plan Commission or Town
Board.
2. For industrial and warehouse use all building
exteriors facing a street or approved way
shall have fifty percent (50%) of the street
face constructed with brick, decorative
masonry, glass panel or other appropriate
finished facade as may be approved by the Plan
Commission and Town Board. Such brick,
masonry, glass, or other decorative facing
shall extend for a distance of at least
twenty-five (25’) feet along the sides of the
structure from the street face.
(b) OVERHEAD DOORS
i. No overhead doors in a business, industrial, or
public district shall face a public street. The
Plan Commission may permit overhead doors to face a
public street when it has made a finding that there
is no feasible alternative location for such doors.
(c) HEATING, AIR CONDITIONING AND VENTILATING EQUIPMENT
i. HVAC equipment shall be located in a manner to be
unobtrusive and screened from view. Landscaping to
be used to screen equipment.
(d) STORAGE OF GARBAGE CANS
Revised 9.23.2019
i. All garbage cans, trash containers, and other
storage devices situated on any lot shall be in
closed containers with lids and shall be concealed
or suitably screened from public view. Fencing or
landscaping shall be used to totally obstruct
vision into the storage areas by the alternatives
set forth in Figure 1 or their equivalent.
(e) OTHER ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS
i. The Plan Commission and Town Board may impose other
architectural standards deemed appropriate such as;
but not limited to: building material samples,
building color samples, roof pitch designs and
architectural breaks in walls over seventy-five
(75’) feet in length. Except for flat roofs, the
minimum pitch shall be 2:12. The Plan Commission
and Town Board may allow a roof pitch less than
2:12 when it has made a finding that there is no
feasible alternative to meet the 2:12 roof pitch.
6) LANDSCAPING
(a) ON-SITE LANDSCAPEING AND SCREENING
i. The following landscape standards are to be
utilized in preparing landscaping plans to be
submitted with site plans. The Plan Commission and
Town Board will review each landscape plan to
determine if it conforms to the intent of these
Standards.
(b) LANDSCAPEING POINT SYSTEM AND MINIMUM INSTALLATION
SIZES FOR PLANTS
i. On-site landscaping shall be required for all
development. All landscaping standards are stated
in terms of the number of landscaping points. The
number of landscaping points is dependent upon the
size of the development. A different number of
points are awarded for each plant, depending upon
its typical growth rate, its mature height, and
whether it is a deciduous or evergreen species. A
minimum installation size is required for each of
these plant categories. These recommendations are
per Table A.
Revised 9.23.2019
(c) DEPICTION OF SAMPLE LANDSCAPING SCHEMES
i. Illustrations A, B, C & D shown on the following
pages, depicts sample landscaping schemes that may
be used for building foundations, developed lots,
street frontages and paved areas. In general,
landscaping schemes similar to Illustration A are
best for building foundations, Illustration B are
best for developed lots, Illustration C are best
for street frontages and Illustration D are best
for paved areas (including parking lots, walkways
and plazas).
(d) MEASUREMENT FOR LANDSCAPING RECOMMENDATIONS
i. A minimum amount of landscaping points are required
for the linear feet of building foundations, the
gross floor area of buildings on developed lots,
the linear feet of street frontage and the total
combined area of paved areas.
(e) LANDSCAPING STANDARDS FOR BUILDING FOUNDATIONS
i. New Buildings and additions shall be accented by a
minimum amount of landscaping placed within a
minimum depth of seven (7’) feet from the building
foundation.
ii. Landscaping for building foundations shall be
placed so that at maturity, the plant’s drip line
is located within ten (10’) feet of the building
foundation. Such landscaping shall not be located
in those areas required for landscaping as street
frontages or paved areas. See Illustration A, for
a suggested scheme. Landscaping shall not impede
vehicle or pedestrian visibility.
iii. For each one-hundred (100’) feet of building
foundation perimeter, forty (40’) landscaping
points shall be provided on a prorated basis, and
installed and permanently maintained.
iv. The intent of this section is to require a visual
screen of a minimum of five (5’) feet in height for
all exterior appurtenances (such as HVAC/electrical
transformers, utility boxes, standpipes, storm
water discharge pipes and other pipes).
7) LANDSCAPING STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPED LOTS
Revised 9.23.2019
(a) This section shall apply to already developed lots
when building additions or remodels with improvements
of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assessed
value of the structure are proposed.
(b) Landscaping for developed lots shall be placed away
from those areas required for landscaping as building
foundations, street frontages, and paved areas. See
Illustration B, for a suggested landscape scheme.
Landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian
visibility.
(c) For each one-thousand (1,000) square feet of gross
building floor area, ten (10) landscaping points shall
be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and
permanently maintained.
(d) The intent of this section is to provide yard shade
and to require a visual screen of a minimum of five
(5) feet in height for all detached exterior
appurtenances (such as HVAC/electrical transformers,
utility boxes, standpipes, storm water discharge pipes
and other pipes).
8) LANDSCAPING STANDARD FOR STREET FRONTAGE
(a) Street frontages for new buildings and additions shall
contain a minimum amount of landscaping in those areas
that abut the right-of-way of a public street.
(b) Landscaping for street frontages shall be located
within ten (10’) feet of the public right-of-way. In
no instance shall such landscaping be located within a
public right-of-way. Landscaping shall not impede
vehicle or pedestrian visibility.
(c) For each one-hundred (100’) linear feet of street
frontage where a developed lot abuts a public street
right-of-way, forty (40) landscaping points shall be
provided on a prorated basis, and installed and
permanently maintained.
(d) Shrubs shall not be used to meet this requirement. A
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of all points shall be
devoted to tall and maintain deciduous trees and a
minimum of thirty percent (30%) of all points shall be
devoted to medium and low Evergreen trees.
9) LANDSCAPING FOR PAVED AREAS
(a) Paved areas for new buildings and additions shall
contain a minimum amount of landscaping with ten (10’)
Revised 9.23.2019
feet of the paved area. The intent of this subsection
is to provide a visual screen of the parking lot from
abutting properties that breaks up the parking lot
look and separates the parking lot stalls providing
shade trees within the parking lot. The screening
around the perimeter of the parking lot shall have
minimum height of forty (40”) inches.
(b) A minimum of two-hundred seventy (270) square feet of
landscaped area, which shall be located in the parking
lot for every ten (10) linear stalls of the paved
area. The landscape island shall take up one and onehalf
(1 ½) parking stalls. See Illustration D, for a
suggested landscaping scheme. Plants used to fulfill
the perimeter requirement should provide fifty percent
(50%) solid screening of the parking, loading and
circulation areas from view from public streets.
Plants used for landscape islands shall be tall and
medium deciduous trees and low shrubs.
(c) All landscaping areas located adjacent to paved areas
shall be separated from the paved area by a continuous
minimum four (4”) inch tall curb which is constructed
of concrete, asphalt, timber or like material approved
by the Plan Commission or Town Board.
(d) For every twenty (20) off-street parking stalls
located in a development, one (1) landscape island a
minimum of two-hundred-seventy (270) square feet shall
be installed and permanently maintained. Each island
shall have a minimum of eighty (80) landscaping points
and devoted to tall or medium deciduous trees and
shrubs.
(e) A ten (10’) foot wide green buffer shall be provided
around the perimeter of all lots excluding areas for
driveway connections to the public street or approved
way.

required landscaping materials shall be a requirement
of these Standards and Guidelines and shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property on which
said materials are required. This requirement shall
run with the property and is binding upon all future
property owners. Development of any and all property
following the effective date of these Standards and

property owner to comply with the provisions of these
Standards and Guidelines. Upon failure to comply with
the provisions of these Standards and Guidelines, upon
failure to comply with these provisions, the Town may
enter upon the property for the purpose of evaluating
and maintaining all required landscaping materials,

side yard could be used if the Plan Commission
determines rear yard is not a practical
location with screening of the side yard.
2. Storage area shall not be visible from any
public right-of-way.
3. Storage area shall be enclosed with a six (6’)
foot high wooden fence or a chain link fence
Revised 9.23.2019
with Evergreen plantings on the street side at
the height of the fence at planting to
screen/break up the view of the fence from the
public.

and displayed in a neat and orderly condition
at all times so that the premises will not
detract from the neighboring premises.
18) MODIFYING AND/OR TERMINATION OF SITE PLAN OR PLAN OF
OPERATION
(a) If any item of the site plan or plan of operation does
not continue in conformance with the approved plan or
operation, the use and site plan approval may be
modified and/or terminated by action of the Town
Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any
decision made by the Town Board which would result in
the modification and/or termination of the use and
site plan as previously approved, the property owner
shall be given written notice of the proposed action
to be taken by the Town Board, and shall be afforded
an opportunity to present evidence and be heard by the
Town Board prior to any final action being taken by
the Town Board which could result in the modification
or termination of the use and site plan.

22.18 MINIMUM PROPERTY MAINTENANCE STANDARDS
1) POLICY, PURPOSE AND SCOPE
(a) POLICY
i. There exist in the Municipality, structures,
residential yards, vacant areas or combinations
thereof which are, or may become, unhygienic,
dilapidated or unsafe with respect to structural
integrity, equipment or maintenance and as such
constitute a menace to the health, safety and
welfare of the public. Lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration of certain properties
have the further effect of creating blighted area
conditions and, if such conditions are not
curtailed and removed, the expenditure of large
amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same will be necessary. Timely regulation and
restriction to contain and prevent blight is
necessary thereby maintaining the desirability and
amenities as well as property values of the
neighborhoods in the Municipality.
(b) PURPOSE
i. The purpose of this Chapter is to protect public
health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum
property maintenance standards. This Chapter does
not replace or modify standards otherwise
established by other portions of this Code of
Ordinances for construction, repair, alteration or
use of buildings. This Chapter is meant to be
remedial and this Chapter shall be liberally
construed to effectuate the purposes stated herein.
Violation of the minimum standards set forth in
this Chapter shall be deemed to be a public
nuisance.

a residential zoned area and to all structures and
sites used for residential purposes but zoned for
other uses.

22.21 REGULATIONS FOR MOVING BUILDINGS
1) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
(a) No person shall move any building or structure greater
than two hundred (200) square feet upon any of the
public ways of the Town without first obtaining a
permit therefore from the Building Inspector and upon
the payment of the required fee. Every such permit
issued by the Building Inspector for the moving of a
building shall designate the route to be taken, the
conditions to be complied with and shall limit the
Revised 9.23.2019
time during which said moving operations shall be
continued.
(b) A report shall be made by Town employees with regard
to possible damage to trees. The estimated cost of
trimming, removal and replacement of public trees, as
determined by the Town, shall be paid to the Town
Clerk prior to issuance of the moving permit.
(c) Issuance of a moving permit shall further be
conditioned on approval of the moving route by the
Town Board.
2) MOVING DAMAGED BUILDINGS
(a) No building shall be repaired, altered, or moved
within, or into, the Town that has deteriorated or has
been damaged by any cause (including such moving and
separation from its foundation, garage, and service
connections in case of moved buildings) forty percent
(40%) or more of its fair market value, and no permit
shall be granted to repair, alter, or move such
building within, or into, the Town. Furthermore, in
the event the fair market value of the building
proposed to be moved within, or into, the Town will
not, after the building has been moved and
improvements completed, equal or exceed the fair
market value of those properties immediately adjoining
and contiguous to the property on which the building
has been moved, and no permit shall be granted to move
the building within, or into, the Town.
3) CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT
(a) The movement of buildings shall be a continuous
operation during all the hours of the day and at
night, until such movement is fully completed. All of
such operations shall be performed with the least
possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No building
shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street
crossing or intersection, or so near thereto as to
prevent easy access to a fire hydrant or any other
public facility. Lights shall be kept in conspicuous
places at each end of the building during the night.
4) STREET REPAIR
(a) Every person receiving a permit to move a building
shall, within one (1) day after said building reaches
Revised 9.23.2019
its destination, report that fact to the Building
Inspector, inspect the streets, highways and curbs and
gutters over which said building has been moved and
ascertain their condition. If the removal of said
building has caused any damage to any street or
highway, the person to whom the permit was issued
shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they
were before the permit was granted. On the failure of
the said permittee to do so within ten (10) days
thereafter to the satisfaction of the Town Board, the
Town shall repair the damage done to such streets and
hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties
on his/her bond responsible for the payment of same.
5) CONFORMANCE WITH CODE
(a) No permit shall be issued to move a building within or
into the Town and to establish it upon a location
within the said Town until the Building Inspector has
made an investigation of such building at the location
from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from
such investigation that said building is in a sound
and stable condition and of such construction that it
will meet the requirements of this Building Code in
all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs,
improvements and remodeling with reference to such
building shall be submitted to the Building Inspector,
and he/she shall make a finding of fact to the effect
that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling are
in conformity with the requirements of this Building
Code and that, when the same are completed, the
building as such will so comply with said Building
Code. In the event a building is to be moved from
the Town to some point outside the boundaries thereof,
the provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans
and specifications for proposed alterations to such
building may be disregarded.
6) BOND
(a) Before a permit is issued to move any building public
way in the Town, the party applying therefore shall
give a cash deposit to the Town in a sum to be
recommended by the Building Inspector and which shall
not be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), to
be approved by the Town Board or conditioned upon,
among other things, the indemnification to the Town
Revised 9.23.2019
for any costs or expenses incurred by it in connection
with any claims for damages to any persons or
property, and the payment of any judgment together
with the costs and expenses incurred by the Town in
connection therewith arising out of the removal of the
building for which the permit is issued.
(b) Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation,
shall find it to be a fact that the excavation exposed
by the removal of such building from its foundation
shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as to
permit the accidental falling therein of travelers or
the location, nature and physical characteristics of
the premises and the exposed excavation, such as to
make intrusion upon the premises and the falling into
such excavation of children under twelve (12) years of
age unlikely, the deposit required by Subsection
(6)(a) shall be further conditioned upon the permittee
erecting adequate barriers and within forty-eight (48)
hours, filling in such excavation or adopting and
employing such other means, devices or methods
approved by the Building Inspector and reasonably
adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences set
forth herein.
7) INSURANCE
(a) The Building Inspector shall require, in addition to
the said bond above indicated, public liability
insurance covering injury to one (1) person in the sum
of not less than one-million dollars ($1,000,000) and
for one accident, aggregate not less than five-million
dollars ($5,000,000), together with property damage
insurance in a sum not less than one-million dollars
($1,000,000), or such other coverage as deemed
necessary.
8) TOWN BOARD APPROVAL
(a) No such permit shall be issued unless it has been
found as a fact by the Town Board of the municipality
by at least a majority vote, after an examination of
the application for the permit which shall include
exterior elevations of the building and accurate
photographs of all sides and views of the same and in
case it is proposed to alter the exterior of said
building, plans and specifications of such proposed
Revised 9.23.2019
alterations and after a view of the building proposed
to be moved and of the site at which it is to be
located, that the exterior architectural appeal and
functional plans of the building to be moved or moved
and altered, will not be so at variance with either
the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan
of the buildings already constructed or in the course
of construction in the immediate neighborhood or in
the character of the applicable district established
by the zoning ordinances or any ordinance amendatory
thereof or supplementary thereto, as to cause a
substantial depreciation of the property values of
said neighborhood within said applicable district. In
case the applicant proposed to alter the exterior of
said building after moving the same, he/she shall
submit, with his/her application papers, complete
plans and specifications for proposed alterations.
Before a permit shall be issued for a building to be
moved and altered, the applicant shall give a cash
deposit to the Town Clerk, which shall not be less
than five-thousand dollars ($5,000) to be executed in
the manner provided in subsection hereof to the effect
that he/she will, within a time to be set by the Town
Board, complete the proposed exterior alterations to
said building in the manner set forth in his/her plans
and specifications. This cash deposit shall be in
addition to any other cash deposit, bond or surety
which may be required by other applicable ordinances
of the Town. No occupancy permit shall be issued for
said building until the exterior alterations proposed
to be made have been completed.
(b) Upon application being made to the Building Inspector,
he/she shall request a meeting of the Town Board to
consider application for moving permits which he/she
has found comply, in all respects, with all other
ordinances of the Town. The Town Board may, if it
desires, hear the applicant for the moving permit in
question and/or the owner of the lot on which it is
proposed to locate the building in question, together
with any other persons, either residents or property
owners, desiring to be heard. The Town Board shall,
in writing, approve, conditionally approve or deny the
application required by this ordinance hereof and file
it in the office of Town Clerk, who shall send a copy
of it to the Building Inspector.

described in Subsection 1).
(b) SIDE DEWATERING
i. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand
filters, up-flow chambers, hydro-cyclones, swirl
concentrators or other appropriate controls
designed and used to remove particles of onehundred (100) microns or greater for the highest
dewatering pump rate. If the water is demonstrated
to have no particles greater than one-hundred (100)
microns during dewatering operations, then no
control is needed before discharge, except as
determined by the Building Inspector. Water may not
be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of
the site or receiving channels.
(c) WASTE AND MATERIAL DISPOSAL
i. All waste and unused building materials including
garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic
materials or hazardous materials shall be properly 
Revised
disposed of and not allowed to be carried by runoff
into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.
(d) TRACKING
i. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives
and parking areas of sufficient width and length to
prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or
private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or
private road shall be removed by street cleaning
(“Not Flushing”) before the end of each workday.
(e) DRAIN INLET PROTECTION
i. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a
straw bale, filter fabric or equivalent barrier
meeting accepted design criteria, standards and
specifications.
(f) SITE EROSION CONTROL
i. The following criteria apply only to land
development or land disturbing activities that
result in runoff leaving the site:
1. Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing
through the site shall be diverted around
disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the
channel shall be protected as described below
in Section 23.07 2) (f) (i) (3)(c). Sheet flow
runoff from adjacent areas greater than tenthousand (10,000) square feet in area shall
also be diverted around disturbed areas,
unless shown to have resultant runoff
velocities of less than one-half (1/2) foot
section across the disturbed area for the set
of one (1) year design storms. Diverted runoff
shall be conveyed in a manner that will not
erode the conveyance and receiving channels.
2. All activities on the site shall be conducted
in a logical sequence to minimize the area of
bare soil exposed at any one (1) time.
3. Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the
site shall be controlled by satisfying both
Subsections a and b or a and c.
Revised
a. All disturbed ground left inactive for
seven (7) or more days shall be
stabilized by seeding or sod (only
available prior to September 15th) or by
mulching, covering or other equivalent
control measure.
b. For sites with ten (10) or more acres
disturbed at one (1) time or if a channel
originates in the disturbed area, one (1)
or more sedimentation basins shall be
constructed. Each sedimentation basin
shall have surface area of at least one
percent (1%) of the area draining to the
basin and at least three (3’) feet of
depth and constructed in accordance with
accepted design specifications. Sediment
shall be removed to maintain a depth of
three (3’) feet. The basin shall be
designed to trap sediment greater than
fifteen (15) microns in size, based on
the set of one (1) year design storms
having durations from one-half to twenty
four (0.5 to 24) hours. The basin
discharge rate shall also be sufficiently
low as to not cause erosion along the
discharge channel or the receiving water.
c. For sites with less than ten (10) acres
disturbed at one (1) time, filter fences,
straw bales or equivalent control
measures shall be placed along all side
slopes and down slope sides of the site.
If a channel or area of concentrated
runoff passes through the site, filter
fences shall be placed along the channel
edges to reduce sediment reaching the
channel.
4. Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more
than ten (10) cubic yards of material shall
not be located with a down slope drainage
length of less than twenty-five (25’) feet
from a roadway or drainage channel. If
remaining for more than seven (7) days, they
shall be stabilized by mulching, vegetative
cover, traps or other means. Erosion from
piles which will be in existence for less than 
Revised
seven (7) days shall be controlled by placing
straw bales or filter fence barriers around
the pile. In street utility repair or
construction soil or dirt storage piles
located closer than twenty-five (25’) feet
from a roadway or drainage channel must be
covered with tarps or suitable alternative
control, if exposed for more than seven (7)
days and the storm drain inlets shall be
protected with straw bales or other
appropriate filtering barriers.

(15)	To preserve prime agricultural land by concentrating housing on lands that have low agricultural potential; 
(16)	To provide commonly-owned open space areas for passive and/or active recreational use by residents of the development and, where specified, the larger community; 
(17)	To provide a diversity of lot sizes, housing choices and building densities to accommodate a variety of age and income groups; 
(18)	To provide buffering between residential development and non-residential uses; 
(19)	To meet demand for housing in a rural setting; 
(20)	To provide an opportunity to create an interconnected network of protected lands; 
(21)	To protect the quality and abundance of ground water resources; and

Minimum required open space: 60 percent of the net buildable area consistent with the prioritized list of resources to conserve and other design consideration of section 11.9A of the County subdivision ordinance. The Zoning Agency may modify the required open space and/or setback requirements of conservation development design on a site specific basis during the conditional use review if the developer can demonstrate that the requirement cannot be met due to unique shape or characteristic of the property. The district open space and/or setback standards for conservation development design may be modified provided that the average intensity and density of land use shall be no greater than that permitted for the district in which it is located. Conservation developments, which are approved with a modification to the open space and/or setback requirements of conservation development design standards, shall not qualify for a density bonus. Modification of the open space and or setback requirements shall be limited to the minimum necessary. Open space shall not be modified greater than 20 percent of the minimum open space percentage requirement of the conservation development design standard. Setbacks shall not be modified below the conventional design standards for the district. Setbacks which are specifically listed as smaller than the conventional design standards by conservation development design standards shall not constitute a modification (i.e. buildings housing animals as specified by conservation development design may be reduced to 25 feet from interior lot lines and not constitute a modification. Setbacks from subdivision roads as listed by conservation design that are less than specified by conventional design shall not constitute a modification). 
A-3 Land holding district. The primary purpose of this district is to preserve for a limited time period in agricultural and related open-space land uses those lands generally located adjacent to existing incorporated urban centers within Walworth County where urban expansion is planned to take place on the adopted regional land use plan and adopted municipal land use plans that refine and detail the regional land use plan. It is the intent that urban development be deferred in such areas until the appropriate legislative bodies concerned determine that it is economically and financially feasible to provide public services and facilities for uses other than those permitted in the district. It is intended that the status of all areas in this district be reviewed by the appropriate planning bodies no less frequently than every five years in order to determine whether, in light of current land development trends, there should be a transfer of all or any part of such areas to some other appropriate use district. Any such review will consider the need for permitting other uses on such land, the nature of the use or uses to be permitted, and the cost and availability of the public services and facilities which will be necessitated by such new use or uses.

C-3 Conservancy-residential district. The primary purpose of this district is essentially the same as that of the C-2 district, namely the protection and preservation of environmentally significant uplands. It is intended that this district be applied to those upland environmental corridors which already have been divided into relatively small parcels or which, because of their proximity to urban areas, have a very high residential value potential. It is thus intended that this district recognize and attempt to balance man's need for shelter locations with his need to protect and restore the natural environment. Because of its residential character and smaller lot area minimum, farming and commercial recreation uses are not permitted.

Sec. 74-59. Review and approval of conditional uses.
The Committee shall review the site, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring land and water uses, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, waste disposal, water supply systems, and the effects of the proposed use, structure, operation and improvement upon flood damage protection, water quality, shoreland cover, natural beauty and wildlife habitat, and shall hold a public hearing after publishing a Class 2 notice thereof under Wis. Stats. ch. 985. A recommendation from the appropriate township must be received before a public hearing may be held. Township recommendations must be submitted by the applicant to the department no later than one week prior to the scheduled hearing. An applicant may be charged a re-notice fee if the recommendation of the township is not received one week prior to the scheduled hearing. 
The Committee may authorize the County Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit after review and public hearing, provided that such conditional uses and structures are in accordance with the purpose and intent of this ordinance as outlined in Sections 74-28 and 74-29 of same, and are found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive, or otherwise adverse to the environmental quality, water quality, shoreland cover, or property values in the County and its communities. Written notice of the proposed conditional use shall be submitted to the Department of Natural Resources ten days prior to said hearing. 
Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, light, fencing, location, size and number of signs, water supply and waste disposal systems, higher performance standards, street dedication, certified survey maps, floodproofing, ground cover, diversions, silting basins, terraces, streambank protection, planting screens, operational control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards, or additional parking may be required by the Committee upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this ordinance, the State Water Resources Act of 1965, and to meet the provisions of the State floodplain and shoreland management programs. 
Compliance with all other provisions of this ordinance, such as lot width and area, yard, site regulations, height, parking, loading, traffic, highway access, and performance standards shall be required of all conditional uses, unless specifically permitted to be modified by the Committee in the conditional uses division. Variances and special exceptions shall only be granted as provided in division 10. 
It is a violation of this ordinance to begin conducting a use identified as a conditional use in any designated zoning district after the effective date of this ordinance without first obtaining the required zoning and conditional use permits. Furthermore, it is a violation of this ordinance to operate a conditional use activity in violation of the conditions of a conditional use permit approved by the Committee. 
Decisions. The Committee may make a decision on conditional use applications at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee. 
Amendments. The Committee may make a decision to amend a conditional use decision if the Committee finds the amendment is in keeping with the purpose and intent of the original conditional use decision and receives town approval. Any reconstruction, structural alteration, parking change or signage change that is consistent with the conditional use permit and does not cause an increase of intensity may be reviewed by staff. Any use of the site not capable of being discerned by staff as consistent with the conditional use is subject to additional Committee review. Any addition or alteration to structures or improvements which exceed 25 percent of the structure size or increase by 25 percent or more of the intensity of use shall be subject to a new conditional use process. 
Appeals. All appeals regarding conditional uses shall be made to the Walworth County Circuit Court via certiorari. Appeals must be commenced seeking the remedy available by certiorari within 30 days after the filing of the decision by the Committee. 
Existing uses. All uses existing at the effective date of this ordinance which would be classified as conditional uses in the particular zoning district concerned if they were to be established after the effective date of this ordinance, are hereby declared to be conforming conditional uses. Any proposed change to the existing use, shall be subject to the conditional use procedures as if such use were being established anew. Also, any addition or alteration to existing structures or improvements which exceed 25 percent of the prior structure size or increase by 25 percent or more prior intensity of use shall be subject to the conditional use procedures as if such use were being established anew. Other than as above restricted, additions, alterations, or extensions to existing structures or improvements are not prohibited provided such changes do not result in a change in the existing use or otherwise violate any provision of the applicable zoning ordinances of Walworth County, Wisconsin. Campgrounds; salvage, wrecking, junk, demolition, and scrap yards; mineral extraction and related uses; and sanitary landfill uses shall be, unless a waiver is granted by the Administrator, additionally subject to the registration regulations set forth in section 74-62, 74-65, 74-67 and 74-68 respectively.

Sec. 74-63. Residential and related uses.
Except where specifically permitted as a principal use in division 3 the following residential and quasi-residential uses shall be conditional uses and may be permitted as specified. In approving or disapproving the location of a conditional use, the Committee shall view the proposed site or sites and shall consider such evidence as may be presented at the public hearing bearing upon the general purpose and intent of this ordinance set forth in sections 74-28 and 74-29 and upon the particular land use problems related to development of the site or sites as proposed. 
(1)	Conservation development design. 
a.	Applicability. Conservation development design may be used on a voluntary basis for all residential developments with five or more dwellings in the A-2, C-2, C-3, R-1, R-2, R-2A and R-3 zoning districts and requires conditional use approval. 
b.	Intent. 
1.	To conserve conservation land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodlands and wetlands, by protecting them from development. Where applicable, conservation land shall be laid out in general accordance with the wide, open space networks advocated by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, to encourage protection of an interconnected system of conservation lands. 
2.	To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs and the amount of paving required for residential development. 
3.	To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation, and by minimizing development on steep slopes. 
4.	To provide for a diversity of lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and residential preferences, so that the community's population diversity may be maintained. 
5.	To conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the adopted County Land Use Plan. 
6.	To create neighborhoods with direct access to open land, with amenities in the form of conservation land. 
7.	To provide for the conservation and maintenance of conservation land within the County to achieve the above-mentioned goals and for active or passive recreational use by residents. 
8.	To provide multiple options for landowners in order to minimize impacts on environmental resources (sensitive lands such as wetlands, floodlands, and steep slopes) and disturbance of natural or cultural features (such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic buildings, and fieldstone walls. 
9.	To provide standards that preserve the unique characteristics of individual properties so that their special or noteworthy features may be designed around and conserved. 
10.	To encourage the protection of the elements of the county's beauty and rural character. 
c.	General regulations for conservation development design: The design of all new subdivisions and other development projects using conservation design shall be governed by the following requirements for the A-2, C-2, C-3, R-1, R-2, R-2A, and R-3 districts: 
1.	Conservation development application, procedure, and approval process: The developer/applicant must follow the conservation development application, procedure, and approval process as identified in section 4.11 of the county subdivision control ordinance. 
2.	Site design. A site context map, existing resources and site analysis map, and sketch plan overlay sheet shall be prepared, as required by sections 5-A., 5-A.1, 5-A.2, and 5-A.3 of the county subdivision control ordinance. All conservation-design development projects shall use the four-step design process for conservation subdivision set forth in section 5-A.4 of the subdivision control ordinance. 
3.	The calculation of site capacity, or the number of dwelling units permitted on a site, shall be based on net buildable area (NBA). The site capacity shall be obtained by dividing the net buildable area within each district by the residential density allowed in the district. Fractional dwelling yield totals may not be combined between different zoning district. The applicant shall determine the net buildable area (NBA) using the following method, substantiated by sufficient plans and data to verify the calculations: 
Gross tract area: _____ acres 
From the gross tract area, subtract the following: 
All lands located within existing and proposed street rights-of-way: _____ acres 
All wetland areas: _____ acres 
All of the area located within a pond, lake, or stream channel: _____ acres 
The result is the net buildable area (NBA): _____ acres 
Note: Where two or more categories overlap, the overlapping acreage shall be counted only once, using the most restrictive classification.

The endowment fund may also be used to cover the cost of any insurance required of the holder of the conservation easement. This density bonus is only considered when a conservation easement is held on undivided conservation land. A density bonus can not be considered when a conservation easement is obtained on an individual subdivision lot or lots. The county and the local unit of government shall review any maintenance agreement and endowment fund established by the subdivider and the nonprofit conservation organization or public agency. 
12.	A five percent density bonus shall be allowed for providing for the reuse or preservation of historical structure(s) located on a site.

Sec. 74-71.1. Revocation.
Grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit, pursuant to section 74-37 and division 4 of this ordinance, shall be limited to one of the following findings:

(2)	The owner/applicant has failed to comply with the conditions of approval imposed. 
(3)	If the Zoning Agency approved the conditional use for a specified amount of time with a known expiration date then, the conditional use shall be automatically revoked upon passing of the expiration date without implementation of the revocation process. The property owner may petition for an extension of the conditional use prior to the expiration date. 
(4)	Conditional use permits that have not been actively exercised on a yearly basis since issuance may be subject to dismissal without prejudice. Dismissal without prejudice shall occur without implementation of the revocation process. In order to dismiss a conditional use without prejudice the County Zoning Administrator or designee shall provide certified notice to the current property owner indicating dismissal of the conditional use shall occur after 60 days of the notice. The notice shall state that the dismissal is the result of the owner's failure to actively exercise the conditional use activity on a yearly basis. The property owner may contest the dismissal by providing a written request of appeal before the County Zoning Agency within 30 days of the notice issuance. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to verify the continued conditional use activity on a yearly basis before the County Zoning Agency. The owner shall be required to pay an associated review fee as established by the County Zoning Agency. Conditional use permits for livestock operations may be dismissed without prejudice according to the same notice procedure stated above if the permit holder fails to do the following within two years after issuance: begin populating the new or expanded livestock facility; begin construction on all of the new structures proposed by the permit.

(Ord. No. 446-07/07, pt. I, 7-10-07)
 
Sec. 74-110. Rules.
The County Board hereby adopts rules for the conduct of the business of the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. The Board may adopt further rules as necessary. 
(1)	Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairman and shall be open to the public. 
(2)	Minutes of the proceedings and a record of all actions shall be kept by the Board, showing the vote of each member upon each question, the reasons for the Board's determination, and its finding of facts. These records shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. 
(3)	The concurring vote of two members of the Board shall be necessary to take official action; correct an error; grant a variance; make an interpretation; and permit a temporary, unclassified or substituted use. 
(4)	Limitation on applications.

(Ord. No. 591-12/09, pt. XVIII, 12-15-09)
 
Sec. 74-111. Powers.
The Board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
(1)	Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator. 
(2)	Variances. To hear and authorize appeals for variances where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. Such variance shall not be contrary to the public interest and shall be so conditioned that the spirit and purposes of this ordinance shall be observed and the public health, safety, and welfare preserved, and substantial justice done. 
(3)	No variance shall have the effect of permitting any use in a district that is prohibited in that district. 
(4)	Interpretations. To hear and decide applications for interpretations of the zoning regulations and the location of the boundaries of the zoning district, floodlands, and shorelands after the County Park and Planning commission has made a review and recommendation. Floodland and shoreland boundaries shall be altered by the Board of Zoning Adjustment only when the applicant presents evidence that clearly and conclusively establishes that the location as shown on the zoning map is incorrect. 
(5)	Substitutions. To hear and grant applications for the substitution of more or equally restrictive nonconforming uses for existing nonconforming uses provided no structural alterations are to be made and the County Zoning Administrator has made a review and recommendation. Whenever the Board permits such a substitution, the use may not thereafter be changed without application.

The permit shall be temporary, may continue only as long as disabled persons reside on the parcel and shall be removed not more than 30 days after the disabled person vacates the parcel. The Board of Adjustment may require the filing of a deed restriction in the register of deeds office to assure removal of the structure in accordance with the stipulation of the approval. A structure no larger than is necessary to allow the disable person to get in and out of the building, would not significantly undermine the basic purpose of the zoning ordinance, especially since they are temporary. 
b.	The Board of Adjustment may hear and grant special exception applications for a substitution in the use of an existing structure that is substandard because it does not conform with the required yards when: 
1.	The substitution requires a change in the zone district of the parcel to a district that allows generally less intense use(s), and; 
2.	Provided the proposed district or use requires lesser or equal setback requirements than the existing district. 
(8)	Temporary uses. To hear and grant applications for temporary uses, in any district provided that such uses are of a temporary nature, do not involve the erection of a substantial structure, and are compatible with the neighboring uses and the County Zoning Administrator has made a review and recommendation. To hear and grant applications for temporary living quarters beyond those permitted in section 74-38/74-165 for a period not to exceed 12 months, due to unique circumstances and provided the request is compatible with the neighboring uses. The permit shall be temporary, revocable, subject to any conditions required by the Board of Adjustment, and shall be issued for a period not to exceed 12 months. Compliance with all other provisions of this ordinance shall be required. 
(9)	Permits. The Board may reverse, affirm wholly or partly or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made. 
(10)	Assistance. The Board may request assistance from any other County officers, departments, commissions, and boards. 
(11)	Oaths. The Chairman may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
(Ord. No. 466-11/07, pt. XII, 11-13-07; Ord. No. 560-06/09, pt. II, 6-9-09; Ord. No. 575-09/09, pt. III, 9-8-09; Ord. No. 591-12/09, pt. XXIX, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 613-05/10, pt. IV, 5-11-10; Ord. No. 1171-06/19, pt. XVII, 6-11-19)
 
Sec. 74-112. Appeals and applications.
Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any persons aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the County or municipality affected by the decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeals shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator within 30 days after the date of written notice of the decision or order of the Zoning Administrator. Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land, or water to be affected at any time and shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeals and application shall include the following: 
(1)	Name and address of the appellant or applicant and all abutting opposite property owners of record. 
(2)	Plat of survey prepared by a registered land surveyor in the State of Wisconsin or other map drawn to scale and approved by the County Zoning Administrator showing all of the information required under section 74-119 for a zoning permit. 
(3)	Additional information required by the Deputy Zoning Administrator, County Zoning Administrator, Board of Adjustment or County Zoning Agency. 
(4)	Fee receipt from the Zoning Administrator. 
 
Sec. 74-113. Hearings.
The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time and place for the hearing, publish a class two notice thereof and shall give due notice of the parties in interest, the Zoning Administrator, and the County Zoning Agency. At the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney. The Board of Adjustment may grant continuances or adjourn hearings from time to time. 
 
Sec. 74-114. Findings.
No variance to the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings. 
(1)	Preservation of intent. No variance shall be granted that is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the district in which the development is located. No variance shall have the affect of permitting a use in any district that is not a stated principal use, or conditional use where a conditional use permit has been granted. 
(2)	Unnecessary hardship. Unnecessary hardship exists when compliance would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. Consideration shall be given to the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance, its effects on the property, and the short-term, long-term and cumulative effects of granting the variance on the neighborhood, the community and on the public interests. Self-imposed or self-created hardships shall not be considered as grounds for the granting of a variance. Economic or financial hardship does not justify a variance. The property bears the burden of proving unnecessary hardship exists. The Board shall consider the property as a whole rather than a portion of the parcel when determining unnecessary hardship. 
(3)	Unique property limitations. Unique physical limitations of the property must be physical limitations such as steep slopes, or wetlands that are not generally shared by other properties must prevent compliance with the ordinance. The circumstances of an applicant (growing family, need for a larger garage, etc) are not a factor in deciding variances. Nearby ordinance violations, prior variances or lack of objections from neighbors do not provide a basis for granting a variance. 
(4)	No harm to public interests. A variance may not be granted which results in harm to public interests. In applying this test, the Board must consider the impacts of the proposal and the cumulative impacts of similar projects on the interests of the neighbors, the entire community and the general public. These interests are listed in the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance and may include public health, safety and welfare, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, natural scenic beauty, minimization of property damages, provision of efficient public facilities and utilities, achievement of eventual compliance for nonconforming uses, structures and lots, and other public interest issues. 
(Ord. No. 591-12/09, pt. XXX, 12-15-09)
 
Sec. 74-115. Decision.
The Board of Adjustment shall decide all appeals and applications within 30 days after the final hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the Board's decision to the appellant or applicant and the Zoning Administrator. 
(1)	Conditions may be placed upon any zoning permit ordered or authorized by the Board. 
(2)	Variances, substitutions, or use permits granted by the Board shall expire within 12 months unless substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant.

Sec. 74-173. Floodplain overlay regulations.
(a)	Areas to be regulated. This ordinance regulates all unincorporated areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(b)	Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of the floodplain district are designated as floodplains or as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 zones on the maps, based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below and revisions listed in section 74-264 (floodplain appendix). Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA, through the letter of map change process before it is effective. No change to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the Land Use and Resource Management office, Walworth County, Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.

The building addition must also be permitted under NR 116.13 of the State Administration Code that regulates floodplain use and its management. 
(f)	Conditional uses. Uses not prohibited or those uses listed below are conditional uses provided the use is also permitted in the zoning district and the applicant can meet the requirements and conditions of 74-187: 
(1)	Wetland restoration projects: The applicant must demonstrate that the project restores or improves functional values, by the installation of best management practices, including increasing flood and storm water storage, maintaining groundwater recharge-discharge, enhanced fisheries and wildlife habitat, improved filtration or storage of sediments, nutrients, and toxins, improved shoreline protection against erosion and any additional wetland functional values. Any damages occurring from wetland restoration will be the responsibility of the applicant(s). Legal arrangements must be made with all affected landowners prior to construction by applicant(s). This is not a mitigation policy, allowing filling of wetlands, but a restoration policy. 
(2)	Water course alterations subject to written notification to all adjacent municipalities, the Department of Natural Resources and FEMA regional offices. The applicant is further required to secure all necessary State and Federal permits. The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.

The applicant shall apply for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process. 
(3)	Maintenance of existing driveway located in the floodplain, that was legally installed prior to the adoption of floodplain maps, if emergency services can be provided during the regional flood. 
(4)	For nonconforming structures that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming structure may be permitted in the footprint and envelope by the Committee in compliance with section 74-187 in order to restore it after the nonflood disaster, provided that the nonconforming structure will meet all the minimum requirements under applicable FEMA regulations (44 CFR Part 60), or the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
(5)	Nonconforming historic structure, not designed for human habitation, on the historic registry may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure, if flood resistant materials are used and if construction practices and floodproofing methods are used. 
(6)	Low flood hazard potential structures such as industrial, commercial and park loading areas, parking areas, boat ramps, and airport landing strips provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the structure has low flood damage potential, the structure is associated with permanent open space uses or are functionally dependent on a waterfront location and the structure will not obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map. 
(7)	Flood storage district development may only be permitted by the Committee if compatible with the land use plan and the zoning district, is contiguous to other lands lying outside the floodplain, streets servicing the property shall be located outside the floodplain, and if an equal volume of storage, as defined by the ground surface and the regional flood elevation, shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, the development shall not affect the conveyance capacity by causing an obstruction to flow or storage capacity of the floodplains, such that it causes any increase in the regional flood height or discharge. Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered as providing an equal volume of storage. If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed. Any structure or building used for human habitation (seasonal or permanent) which is to be erected in a flood storage district which is to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, structurally altered or moved into the flood storage district shall be placed on fill with the finished surface of the lowest floor, excluding basement or crawlway, at or above the flood protection elevation. Fill shall be at least one foot above the regional flood elevation and shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of any structure or building erected thereon and dryland access shall be provided. If any such structure or building has a basement or crawlway, the surface of the floor of the basement or crawlway shall be at or above the regional flood elevation and shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in accordance with NR 116.16. No variance may be granted to allow any floor below the regional flood elevation. 
(8)	Any structure or improvement not prohibited in this floodplain overlay district are conditional uses requiring review and approval by the Committee. 
(g)	Discrepancies. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection (1) and (2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 74-259 amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a zoning permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. When the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section 74-259 amendments. 
(1)	If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(2)	Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(h)	Hydraulic and hydrologic studies. All hydraulic and hydrologic studies shall be completed under the direct supervision of a professional engineer registered in the State. The study contractor shall be responsible for the technical adequacy of the study. All studies shall be reviewed and approved by the DNR.

viii.	Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices. 
ix.	The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet.

In compliance with NR115 the following Shoreland Zoning Standards shall control the use of shorelands to afford the protection of water quality as specified in NR 102, NR 103 and Wis. Stats. ch. 281. In addition to any other applicable general use, site, permitting requirements or sanitary regulations, the following shoreland restrictions and regulations shall apply to: 
A).	Areas to be regulated.
1.	All unincorporated land lying within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the unincorporated areas of Walworth County shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources publication "Surface Water Resources of Walworth County" or are shown on the United States geological survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps. 
2.	All unincorporated lands lying within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or the landward side of the floodplain, whichever is greater. Rivers and streams in Walworth County shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps referenced in section 74-177 of this ordinance. If evidence to the contrary is presented; the County Zoning Administrator shall make the initial determination whether or not the river or stream in question is navigable under laws of this State. The County Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district DNR office for a determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. Flood hazard boundary maps, or flood insurance study maps (or soil maps or other existing County maps used to delineate floodplain areas which have been adopted by Walworth County) shall be used to determine the extent of the floodplain of rivers or streams in Walworth County.

An expansion of a structure beyond the existing footprint is permitted if the expansion is necessary to comply with applicable state or Federal requirements. Property owners, builders and contractors are responsible for compliance with the terms of this ordinance. 
C).	Vegetation. To protect natural scenic beauty, fish and wildlife habitat, water quality and to promote preservation and restoration of native vegetation. The purposes of the regulations shall be to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structure and land uses and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. The County has established the following standards and requirements that consider sound forestry and soil conservation practices and the effect of vegetation removal on water quality, including soil erosion, and the flow of effluents, sediments and nutrients. 
All vegetation removal activities shall be conducted so as to prevent erosion and sedimentation, and preserve the natural scenic beauty of the County. Natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable and, where removed, it shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and preserving natural beauty. Natural vegetation, especially woody cover, in the area closest to the water is crucial for fish and riparian wildlife. The vegetation regulations do not apply to the removal of dead, diseased or dying trees or shrubbery within 35' shore yard setback, if verified and approved by the County. 
Vegetation removal shall be conducted in accordance with the County's conservation standards and shall require a County-approved conservation plan and permit, subject to the dimensional requirements listed below. County conservation standards are technical standards disseminated by the Department of Natural Resources under NR151 and include the Wisconsin Field Office Technical Guide, Section IV, Conservation Standards and Construction Standards, and other standards approved by the Land Conservation Committee. In addition, the County Zoning Administrator may, where appropriate, require an applicant to furnish a surety to enable the County to carry out land restoration work in the event of default by the applicant in carrying out an approved conservation plan. The amount of such surety shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator, and the form and type of all sureties shall be approved by the Committee. The County Zoning Administrator may, as appropriate, request a review of the proposed vegetation removal or earth movement activity by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, or other appropriate agency, and await their comments and recommendations before issuing a permit but not to exceed 30 days. 
1.	On those lands within 35 feet of the OHWM (ordinary high water mark) vegetation removal is prohibited (no touch zone), with the following exceptions subject to a County approved conservation plan and permit: 
a.	Vegetation removal for the creation of a view/access corridor. In the strip of land 35 feet wide inland from the ordinary high water mark a view/access corridor is permitted provided the combined width of all access and viewing corridors on a riparian lot or parcel does not exceed 35 percent of the shoreline frontage on a parcel. A view/access corridor is permitted to run contiguously for the entire maximum width of shoreline frontage on a parcel. 
b.	Vegetation removal for the location of those structures permitted within the shore yard; 
c.	For those shoreline protection projects authorized by a DNR permit provided that erosion control measures are designed to remedy significant and existing erosion problems; 
d.	Vegetation removal along a farm drainage ditch provided the removal is part of drainage ditch maintenance work that is conducted consistent with the requirements of Wis. Stats. ch. 88 and if the land conservation division determines that soil and water conservation practices are sufficient and no pollution is occurring on the site. Land adjacent to farm drainage ditches shall be vegetated and maintained with ground layer vegetation, such as turf grass; 
e.	Selective removal of exotic, invasive, damaged vegetation or vegetation that must be removed to control disease or poses an imminent safety hazard provided that any vegetation removed be replaced by replanting with vegetation approved by the Land Conservation Division, in the same area as soon as practicable; 
f.	For the removal of trees and shrubs in the vegetative buffer zone on a parcel with ten or more acres of forested land consistent with "generally accepted forestry management practices" as defined in S. NR 1.25 (2) (b), and described in Department publication "Wisconsin Forest Management Guidelines" (publication FR-226), provided that vegetation removal be consistent with these practices. 
g.	Additional vegetation management activities for mitigation in the vegetative buffer zone. The permit issued under this section shall require that all management comply with detained plans approved by the County and designed to control erosion by limiting sedimentation into the waterbody, to improve the plant community by replanting in the same area, and to maintain and monitor the newly restored area. The permit also shall require an enforceable restriction to preserve the newly restored area. 
h.	Prescribed burns on greater than 150 linear feet of shoreline with a plan approved by the land conservation division provided the project cannot be accomplished by selective removal in accordance with subsection e. above and further provided it is done in a manner designed to minimize erosion, sedimentation and impairment of fish and wildlife habitat and preserves the natural shoreline beauty. 
i.	Routine maintenance of vegetation. 
2.	A special vegetation removal plan allowing greater vegetation removal than that permitted in 1. above, may be permitted by the Committee by issuance of a conditional use permit, pursuant to section 74-187. An application for such a permit shall include a survey of the lot providing the following information; location of parking, topography of the land, existing vegetation, proposed cutting, and proposed replanting. The Committee may grant such a permit only if it finds that such special vegetation removal plans: 
a.	Will not cause undue erosion or destruction of scenic beauty; and 
b.	Will provide substantial visual screening from the water of dwellings, accessory structures and parking areas. Where the plan calls for replacement plantings, the Commission may require the submission of a bond which guarantees the performance of the planned tree or shrubbery replacement by the lot owner, and 
c.	Will provide a public good. 
3.	Beyond the 35-foot strip, which can be accomplished using accepted forest management and soil conservation practices which protects water quality with a County approved conservation plan and permit shall be required for projects within 300 feet of the OHWM (ordinary high water mark) and which are either: 
a.	On slopes of more than 20 percent: 
b.	Larger than 1,000 square feet on slopes of 12—20 percent; or 
c.	Larger than 2,000 square feet on slopes less than 12 percent. 
D).	Earth movements. To protect natural scenic beauty, fish and wildlife habitat, water quality and to promote preservation and restoration of native vegetation, the County has established the following standards and requirements that consider sound forestry and soil conservation practices and the effect of vegetation removal on water quality, including soil erosion, and the flow of effluents, sediments and nutrients. 
1.	All earth movement activities within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark shall be limited to minimal grade changes and only if it is done in a manner designed to minimize erosion, sedimentation and impairment of fish and wildlife habitat and preserves natural shoreline beauty. Earth movement shall not create level living space in the shore yard.; 
2.	Earth movements involving stream course changing, waterway construction or enlargement, channel clearing, removal of stream or lake bed materials, are conditional uses requiring review, public hearing, and approval by the Committee in accordance with division 4. However, such earth movements having a DNR approval under Wis. Stats. ch. 30 are exempt from this provision. 
a.	All earth movement activities shall be conducted as to minimize erosion and sedimentation, and preserve the natural scenic beauty of the County. Natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable and, where removed, it shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and preserving natural beauty. Natural shorelines, especially woody cover, in the area closest to the water are crucial for fish and riparian wildlife. 
b.	Earth movements shall be conducted in accordance with the County's conservation standards and shall require a County-approved conservation plan and permit, subject to the dimensional requirements listed below. County conservation standards are technical standards adopted by the Land Conservation Committee and include the Wisconsin Field Office Technical Guide, Section IV, Conservation Standards and Construction Standards, the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Handbook, Wisconsin Storm Water Manual and other standards approved by the Land Conservation Committee. In addition, the County Zoning Administrator may, where appropriate, require an applicant to furnish a surety to enable the County to carry out land restoration work in the event of default by the applicant in carrying out an approved conservation plan. The amount of such surety shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator, and the form and type of all sureties shall be approved by the Committee. The County Zoning Administrator may, as appropriate, request a review of the proposed earth movement activity by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, or other appropriate agency, and await their comments and recommendations before issuing a permit but not to exceed 30 days. 
E).	Impervious surfaces.
1.	Impervious surface standards are established to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat and protect against pollution of navigable waters. Impervious surface standards shall apply to the construction of any impervious surface that increases the percent of impervious surface that is or will be located within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of any navigable waterway on any of the following: 
a.	A riparian lot or parcel. 
b.	A nonriparian lot or parcel that is located entirely within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of any navigable waterway. 
2.	Calculation. Percentage of impervious surface shall be calculated by dividing the surface area of the existing and proposed impervious surfaces on the lot or parcel by the total surface area of that lot or parcel, and multiplying by 100. Treated impervious surfaces (described in 9 below) may be excluded from the calculation where the property owner can show that the runoff from the impervious surface is treated by devices such as storm water ponds, constructed wetlands, infiltration basins, rain gardens, bioswales or other engineered systems, or that the runoff discharges to internally drained pervious area that retains the runoff on or off the parcel to allow infiltration into the soil. If an outlot lies between the ordinary high water mark and the developable lot or parcel and both are in common ownership, the lot or parcel and the outlot shall be considered one lot or parcel for the purposes of calculating the percentage of impervious surfaces. For properties that have been "condominiumized" the impervious surface calculations apply to the entire property. The property is still under one legal description and the proposed expansion to a unit is not the only impervious surface calculated since the regulation states lot or parcel and not a unit. Mitigation applies to the property as a whole and not just to the portion of the frontage that might be in front of the unit impacted. 
3.	General impervious surface standards. 
a.	General standard. Except as allowed below and except for those lawfully existing impervious surfaces, a lot or parcel is allowed up to 15% impervious surface as calculated above. 
b.	Maximum general impervious surface. A property may exceed the impervious surface standards under (3.a) above provided, more than 15% impervious surface but not more than 30% impervious surface may be allowed with a County approved permit and mitigation plan and measures implemented by the property owner by the date specified in the permit. 
AND 
4.	Impervious surface standards on highly developed shorelines identified as: 
a.	Highly developed shoreline standard. A lot or parcel on a DNR approved highly developed shoreline (SEE 74-265), is allowed up to 30 percent impervious surface for residential land uses or up to 40 percent impervious surface for commercial, industrial or business land uses, as calculated above. A map of highly developed shorelines approved by DNR per NR115.05(1)(e)2m.b. are adopted and made part of this ordinance in digital format developed with geographic information systems software and are available to the public in the office of the County Zoning Administrator or on the County website. 
b.	Maximum impervious surface. A property may exceed the impervious surface standards under (4.a.) above provided, more than 30 percent but not more than 40 percent impervious surface on the lot or parcel for properties that have a residential land use, or more than 40 percent impervious surface but not more than 60 percent impervious surface for properties that have a commercial, industrial or business land use with a County approved mitigation plan and measures implemented by the property owner by the date specified in the permit. 
5.	Existing impervious surfaces. (also see 74-174 (G)) Existing impervious surfaces that were legally constructed but that do not comply with the impervious surface standards in subds 3 and 4 above, are permitted to do the following (without mitigation) as long as the percentage of impervious surface that existed lawfully on the effective date of the ordinance is not increased: 
a.	Maintain and repair all impervious surfaces.

8.	Mitigation plan. For lots or parcels that exceed the impervious surface standard, but do not exceed the maximum impervious surface standard, the County may issue a complete permit that requires a mitigation plan reviewed and approved by the County Zoning Division and Land Conservation Division (if applicable) and implemented by the property owner by the date specified in the permit. The application shall include the following: 
a.	A site plan that describes the proposed mitigation measures. The site plan shall be designed and implemented to restore natural functions lost through development and human activities. 
b.	The mitigation measures shall be proportional in scope to the amount and impacts of the impervious surface being permitted to establish or maintain measures adequate to offset the impacts of the impervious surface on water quality, near-shore habitat, upland wildlife habitat and natural scenic beauty. 
c.	The mitigation plan shall include an implementation schedule and enforceable obligations on the property owner to establish and maintain the mitigation measures. 
d.	The obligations of the property owner under the mitigation plan shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds. 
9.	Treated impervious surfaces; The impervious surface calculation may exclude any existing or proposed impervious surface where the property owner can show the County that runoff from the impervious surface is treated by existing or proposed devices such as storm water ponds, constructed wetlands, infiltration systems, rain gardens, bioswales or other engineered systems, or that the runoff discharges to internally drained pervious area that retains the runoff on or off the parcel to allow infiltration into the soil. If a property owner or subsequent property owner fails to maintain the treatment system, treatment device or internally drained area, the impervious surface is no longer exempt under this ordinance. 
a.	For smaller sites, such as those usually associated with shoreland areas, hydrologic modeling is not necessary if the landowner simply infiltrates or treats the first ½ inch of runoff discharging from the existing and planned impervious surfaces. This method shall demonstrate how the infiltration system and/or best management practice(s) will result in the exceedance of the following storm water discharge standards: 
1.	Capture 80% of the total suspended solids (i.e. sediment/water quality standard); 
2.	Infiltrate 90% of the predevelopment runoff volume (i.e. runoff volume standard). 
b.	The County may exclude an impervious surface from the impervious surface calculation provided the property owner can demonstrate that one or more of the following general standards apply, and the existing or proposed infiltration system or best management practice(s) conform to County Conservation Standards or the applicable technical standards: 
1.	One-half inch of runoff from the area of impervious surface is treated by a storm water BMP, complying with the County Conservation Standards, or 
2.	One-half inch of runoff from the surface is discharged to an internally drained pervious area that retains the runoff on or off the parcel to allow infiltration into the soil. 
c.	A storm water management plan and permit must be approved by the County, pursuant to the Walworth County Storm Water Management Ordinance, Chapter 26, Walworth County Code of Ordinances. 
F).	Height. To protect and preserve wildlife habitat and natural scenic beauty, the height restrictions stated elsewhere in this ordinance shall be limited that no construction shall result in a structure taller than 35 feet within 75 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of any navigable waters. 
G).	Substandard structures. Substandard (nonconforming structure per NR 115) shore yard setback for a principal structure. Section 74-219 may be modified to permit the vertical expansion of a substandard shore yard setback for a principal structure to a height of 35 feet. An existing principal structure that was legally constructed but that does not comply with the required shore yard setback requirement shall comply with all of the following requirements: 
1.	The height is limited to 35 feet if any part of the structure is located less than 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
2.	Maintenance, repair, replacement, restoration, rebuild, removal, remodeling or vertical expansion of substandard principal structure. An existing principal structure that was lawfully placed when constructed but that does not comply with the required shore yard setback may be maintained, repaired or replaced on the property provided all of the following requirements are met: 
a.	Shall be located in the footprint. 
b.	May permit a vertical expansion to a height of 35 feet. 
c.	An expansion to the footprint is only permitted if the expansion is necessary for the structure to comply with applicable state or Federal requirements. 
d.	A mitigation plan is not required solely for activity under this paragraph but may be required under E.) Impervious surface.

The height is limited to 35 feet if any part of the structure is located less than 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
4.	A one-time lateral expansion is limited to a maximum of 200 square feet over the life of the structure provided the existing principal structure is at least 35 feet from the ordinary high water mark. No portion of the expansion may be any closer to the ordinary high water mark than the closest point of the existing principal structure. The County may issue a permit for a lateral expansion that requires a mitigation plan approved by the County and implemented by the property owner by the date specified in the permit. 
a.	The existing principal structure is at least 35 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
b.	The County shall issue a permit for a lateral expansion that requires a mitigation plan approved by the County and implemented by the property owner by the date specified in the permit. 
c.	The mitigation plan shall include enforceable obligations of the property owner to establish or maintain measures adequate to offset the impacts of the impervious surface on water quality, near-shore habitat, upland wildlife habitat and natural scenic beauty. 
d.	The mitigation measures shall be proportional to the amount and impacts of the impervious surface. The obligations of the property owner under the mitigation plan shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds. 
e.	The height is limited to 35 feet if any part of the structure is located less than 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
f.	All other provisions of the shoreland zoning ordinance shall be met.

The obligations of the property owner under the mitigation plan shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds. 
e.	The height is limited to 35 feet if any part of the structure is located less than 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
f.	All other provisions of the shoreland ordinance shall be met. 
6.	Expansion of substandard principal structure beyond setback. An existing principal structure that was legally constructed but that does not comply with the required shore yard setback requirement may be expanded horizontally, landward or vertically provided that the expanded area meets the shore yard setback requirements and that all other provisions of the shoreland ordinance are met. A mitigation plan is not required solely for activity under this paragraph but may be required under E.) Impervious surface. The height is limited to 35 feet if any part of the structure is located less than 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
7.	Maintenance, repair, replacement or vertical expansion of structures that were authorized by variance. (Wis. Stats. § 59.692(1k)(a)2. and (a)4.) A structure of which any part has been authorized to be located within the shoreland setback area by a variance granted before July 15, 2015 may be maintained, repaired, replaced, restored, rebuilt or remodeled if the activity does not expand the footprint of the authorized structure. Additionally, the structure may be vertically expanded unless the vertical expansion would extend more than 35 feet above grade level. An expansion of a structure beyond the existing footprint is permitted if the expansion is necessary to comply with applicable state or Federal requirements. 
8.	All other provisions of the shoreland zoning ordinance shall be met. 
H).	Waste materials.

A-3 Land holding district. The primary purpose of this district is to preserve for a limited time period in agricultural and related open-space land uses those lands generally located adjacent to existing incorporated urban centers within Walworth County where urban expansion is planned to take place on the adopted regional land use plan. It is the intent that urban development be deferred in such areas until the appropriate legislative bodies concerned determine that it is economically and financially feasible to provide public services and facilities for uses other than those permitted in the district. It is intended that the status of all areas in this district be reviewed by the appropriate planning bodies no less frequently than every five years in order to determine whether, in light of current land development trends, there should be a transfer of all or any part of such areas to some other appropriate use district. Any such review will consider the need for permitting other uses on such land, the nature of the use or uses to be permitted, and the cost and availability of the public services and facilities which will be necessitated by such new use or uses.

C-3 Conservancy-residential district. The primary purpose of this district is essentially the same as that of the C-2 district, namely the protection and preservation of environmentally significant uplands. It is intended that this district be applied to those upland environmental corridors which already have been divided into relatively small parcels or which, because of their proximity to urban areas, have a very high residential value potential. It is thus intended that this district recognize and attempt to balance man's need for shelter locations with his need to protect and restore the natural environment. Because of its residential character and smaller lot area minimum, farming and commercial recreation uses are not permitted.

C-4 Shoreland Wetland district. The district is created to maintain safe and healthful conditions, to prevent water pollution, to protect fish spawning grounds and wildlife habitat. The primary purpose of this district is to preserve, protect, and enhance the lakes, streams, and wetland areas in Walworth County in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland. The proper regulation of these areas will serve to maintain and improve water quality, both ground and surface; prevent flood damage; protect wildlife habitat; prohibit the location of structures on soils which are generally not suitable for such use; protect natural watersheds; preserve shore cover; preserve natural beauty; and protect the water based recreational resources of the County. 
(1)	Designation. The C-4 district includes shorelands wetlands in the jurisdiction of this ordinance which are designated as wetlands on the current Shoreland Zoning Map-Walworth County, Wisconsin and actual field delineations. The most recent version of the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory as depicted on the Department of Natural Resources Surface Water Data Viewer (SWDV) is incorporated into this ordinance as a reference in determining the location of wetlands. 
(2)	Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted, subject to general shoreland zoning regulations in section 74-173 and 74-174 of this ordinance, the provisions of Wis. Stats. ch. 30 and 31, and the provisions of other State and Federal laws, if applicable:

2.	Dike and dam construction and ditching for the purpose of growing and harvesting cranberries; and 
3.	Ditching, tiling, dredging, excavating or filling done to maintain or repair existing agricultural drainage systems only to the extent necessary to maintain the level of drainage required to continue the existing agricultural use. This includes the minimum filling necessary for disposal of dredged spoil adjacent to the drainage system provided that dredged spoil is placed on existing spoil banks where possible; 
4.	The construction or maintenance of fences for the pasturing of livestock, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such construction of maintenance; 
5.	The construction or maintenance of piers, docks or walkways built on pilings, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such construction and maintenance; and 
6.	The maintenance, repair, replacement or re-construction of existing town and County highways and bridges including limited excavating and filling necessary for such maintenance, repair, replacement or reconstruction.

DIVISION 4. CONDITIONAL USES
 
Sec. 74-185. Application.
Pre-application requests. A pre-application meeting shall be required prior to the submittal of any conditional use request for subdivisions, condominiums or campgrounds of five or more units, or any conditional use request in the A-4, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, M-1, M-2, M-3, or M-4 zone district with buildings 10,000 square foot or greater, or any conditional use requests for land restoration on sites two acres or greater, or any conditional use request for a solar energy system over one megawatt, or upon applicant's request. The pre-application process shall include a sketch plan prepared by a registered land surveyor and the applicable fee. The plans submitted shall be reviewed in a meeting scheduled by the County. The plans shall be reviewed for issues related to, but not limited to, platting, zoning, sanitation, storm water, highway and parks. If a pre-application meeting is held during the changes and amendment (rezone) process, a pre-application meeting is not required during this process. 
Application for conditional use permits and amendments shall be made to the County Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by the Administrator and shall include the following where pertinent and necessary for proper review by the Committee: 
(1)	Name and addresses of the applicant, owner of the site, architect, professional engineer, contractor, and all opposite and abutting property owners of record. 
(2)	Description of the subject site by lot, block, and recorded subdivision or by metes and bounds; address of the subject site; type of structure; proposed operation or use of the structure or site; number of employees; and the zoning district within which the subject site lies. 
(3)	Plat of survey prepared by a land surveyor registered in Wisconsin or other map drawn to scale and approved by the County Zoning Administrator, showing the location, property boundaries, dimensions, elevations, uses, and existing and proposed easements, streets, and other public ways; off-street parking, loading areas and driveways; existing highway access restrictions; existing and proposed street, side and rear yards. In addition, the plat of survey shall show the location, elevation, and use of any abutting lands and their structures within 40 feet of the subject site; soil mapping unit lines; mean and historic highwater lines, on or within 40 feet of the subject premises, and existing and proposed landscaping. 
(4)	Additional information as may be required by the Committee, County Zoning Administrator, County Land Conservation or County Sanitarian, such as ground surface elevations, basement and first floor elevations, utility elevations, historic and probable future floodwater elevations, areas subject to inundation by floodwaters, depths of inundation, floodproofing measures, soil type, slope, storm water consistent with the storm water management ordinance and boundaries, and plans for proposed structures giving dimensions and elevations pertinent to the determination of the hydraulic capacity of the structure of its affects and flood flows. 
(5)	Applications. A party shall not initiate action for a conditional use permit affecting the same land more than twice every 12 months. The 12 months to be calculated from the date of the conclusion of the first County Planning, Zoning, and Sanitation Committee public hearing. If a change in a County zoning ordinance or State statute affects the subject matter of the permit request, the party may apply again even if there have been two actions on the same land within the 12-month period. 
(6)	Submission to township. A party shall submit a copy of the same application for a conditional use permit to the township where the parcel is located. An applicant shall receive a recommendation from the appropriate township concerning all conditional use applications. 
(7)	Applications for conditional use permits and amendments for a livestock facility shall follow the procedures and standards as established in section 74-186.1 and ATCP 51.30; ATCP 51.32; and ATCP 51.34. 
(Amd. of 1-11-05; Ord. No. 419-03/07, pt. III, 3-13-07; Ord. No. 466-11/07, pt. XX, 11-13-07; Ord. No. 740-09/12, pt. XXIX, 9-6-12; Ord. No. 879-09/14, pt. XX, 9-4-14; Ord. No. 1049-06/17, pt. XXXVIII, 6-13-17; Ord. No. 1171-06/19, pt. XXIX, 6-11-19)
 
Sec. 74-186. Review and approval of conditional uses.
The Committee shall review the site, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring land and water uses, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, waste disposal, water supply systems, and the affects of the proposed use, structure, operation, and improvement upon flood damage protection, water quality, shoreland cover, natural beauty and wildlife habitat, and shall hold a public hearing after publishing a class 2 notice thereof under Wis. Stats. ch. 985. A recommendation from the appropriate township must be received before a public hearing may be held. Township recommendations must be submitted by the applicant to the Department no later than one week prior to the scheduled hearing. An applicant may be charged a re-notice fee if the recommendation of the township is not received one week prior to the scheduled hearing. 
The Committee may authorize the County Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit after review and public hearing, provided that such conditional uses and structures are in accordance with the purpose and intent of this ordinance as outlined in Sections 74-153 and 74-154 of same, and are found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive, or otherwise adverse to the environmental quality, water quality, shoreland cover, or property values in the County and its communities. Written notice of the proposed conditional use shall be submitted to the Department of Natural Resources ten days prior to said hearing. 
Conditions, such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, location, size and number of signs, water supply and waste disposal systems, higher performance standards, street dedication, certified survey maps, floodproofing, ground cover, diversions, silting basins, terraces, streambank protection, planting screens, operational control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards, or additional parking may be required by the Committee upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this ordinance, the State Water Resources Act of 1965, and to meet the provisions of the Wisconsin Floodplain and Shoreland Management Programs. 
Compliance with all other provisions of this ordinance, such as lot width and area, yard, site regulations, height, parking, loading, traffic, highway access, and performance standards, shall be required of all conditional uses, unless specifically permitted to be modified by the Committee in the conditional uses division. Variances and special exceptions shall only be granted as provided in division 10. 
It is a violation of this ordinance to begin conducting a use identified as a conditional use in any designated zoning district after the effective date of this ordinance without first obtaining the required zoning and conditional use permits. Furthermore, it is a violation of this ordinance to operate a conditional use activity in violation of the conditions of a conditional use permit approved by the Committee. 
Existing uses. All uses existing at the effective date of this ordinance which would be classified as conditional uses in the particular zoning district concerned if they were to be established after the effective date of this ordinance, are hereby declared to be conforming conditional uses. Any proposed change to the existing use, shall be subject to the conditional use procedures as if such use were being established anew. Also, any addition or alteration to existing structures or improvements which exceed 25 percent of the prior structure size or increase by 25 percent or more prior intensity of use shall be subject to the conditional use procedures as if such use were being established anew. Other than as above restricted, additions, alterations, or extensions to existing structures or improvements are not prohibited provided such changes do not result in a change in the existing use or otherwise violate any provision of the applicable Zoning Ordinances of Walworth County, Wisconsin. Campgrounds; salvage, wrecking, junk, demolition, and scrap yards; mineral extraction and related uses; and sanitary landfill uses shall be, unless a waiver is granted by the Administrator, additionally subject to the registration regulations set forth in sections 74-189, 74-192, 74-194 and 74-195 respectively. 
A copy of all conditional use permits shall be transmitted to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources within 10 days after the issuance of the decision. 
Decisions. The Committee may make a decision on conditional use applications at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee. 
Amendments. The Committee may make a decision to amend a conditional use decision if the Committee finds the amendment is in keeping with the purpose and intent of the original conditional use decision and receives town approval. Any reconstruction, structural alteration, parking change or signage change that is consistent with the conditional use permit and does not cause an increase of intensity may be reviewed by staff. Any use of the site not capable of being discerned by staff as consistent with the conditional use is subject to additional Committee review. Any addition or alteration to structures or improvements which exceed 25 percent of the structure size or increase by 25 percent or more of the intensity of use shall be subject to a new conditional use process. 
Appeals. All appeals regarding conditional uses shall be made to the County Circuit Court via certiorari. Appeals must be commenced seeking the remedy available by certiorari within 30 days after the filing of the decision by the Committee. 
(Amd. of 1-11-05; Amd. of 8-9-05; Ord. No. 591-12/09, pt. XLIV, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 613-05/10, pt. VI, 5-11-10; Ord. No. 740-09/12, pt. XXX, 9-6-12; Ord. No. 819-12/13, pt. V, 12-10-13; Ord.

Sec. 74-186.1. Reserved.
Editor's note(s)—Ord. No. 1194-11/19, adopted November 12, 2019, amended the Code by repealing former § 74-186.1, which pertained to livestock facility siting, and derived from Ord. No. 879-09/14, adopted September 4, 2014. 
 
Sec. 74-187. Shoreland and floodplain uses.
In approving or disapproving a conditional use in the floodplain, the Committee shall deny any permit if it is determined (Hydraulic and Hydrologic Analyses) that the proposed request will obstruct flow or storage capacity of the floodplains, such that it causes an increase in the regional flood height 0.00 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, whichever is more restrictive. No floodplain use shall obstruct flow, defined as use which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other use, increasing regional flood height or increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.00 foot. The Committee shall consider the purpose and intent of this ordinance and such evidence as a cross-section elevation view of the proposal, perpendicular to the watercourse, showing if the proposed use will obstruct flow or any analysis calculating the effects of this proposal on regional flood height. Any structure shall have their lowest floor and their heating, electrical, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other vital utility facilities constructed at or above the flood protection elevation. Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the Zoning Administrator and shall consist of a plan or document certified by a registered engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood pressures, depths, velocities, uplift and impact forces and other regional flood factors associated with the 100-year recurrence interval flood. 
Wetland restoration projects shall also provide evidence that no material is deposited in a navigable channel unless a permit is issued by the Department of Natural Resources pursuant to Wis. Stats. ch. 30, and a permit pursuant to sec. 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1344 has been issued, if applicable, and the other requirements of this section are met. Any fill or material will be protected against erosion and shall not include any solid or hazardous material. A project to restore a wetland area by the installation of best management practices, the applicant must demonstrate that the project restores or improves functional values including increasing flood and storm water storage, maintaining groundwater recharge-discharge, enhanced fisheries and wildlife habitat, improved filtration or storage of sediments, nutrients, and toxins, improved shoreline protection against erosion and any additional wetland functional values. Any damages occurring from wetland restoration will be the responsibility of the applicant(s). Legal arrangements must be made with all affected landowners prior to construction by applicant(s). This is not a mitigation policy, allowing filling of wetlands, but a restoration policy. 
Water course alterations subject to written notification to all adjacent municipalities, the Department of Natural Resources and FEMA regional offices. The applicant is further required to secure all necessary State and Federal permits. The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation, and pursuant to div. 12, the applicant shall provide the Zoning Administrator with the appropriate technical or scientific data in accordance with NFIP guidelines for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process. 
Nonconforming structures that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster shall also comply with the following: limit the repair or reconstruction of any such structure to the footprint and envelope of the structure. If a compliant location exists, the structure should be moved to the compliant location to the greatest extent possible. The structure must not obstruct flow of flood waters or cause any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the regional flood. Contiguous dryland access must be provided. The structure must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The structure shall be floodproofed, by means other than fill, to an elevation at or above the 100 year recurrence interval floodplain. Floodproofing measures, by means other than filling, shall be designed to withstand flood pressures, depths, velocities, uplift and impact forces and other regional flood factors, protect structures to the flood protection elevation, anchor structures to foundations to resist flotation and lateral movement, and insure that structural walls and floors are watertight to the flood protection elevation, and the interior remains completely dry during flooding without human intervention. Floodproofing measures could include reinforcing walls and floors to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or adding mass or weight to prevent flotation, placing essential utilities above the flood protection elevation, installing surface or subsurface drainage systems to relieve foundation wall and basement floor pressures, constructing water supply wells and waste treatment systems to prevent the entry of flood waters, or putting cutoff valves on sewer lines or eliminating gravity flow basement drains. 
Nonconforming historic structure, not designed for human habitation, shall also comply with the following: A non-conforming historic structure on the historic registry may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure, if flood resistant materials are used, if construction practices and floodproofing methods, other than filling, are used. Floodproofing measures, by means other than filling, shall be designed to withstand flood pressures, depths, velocities, uplift and impact forces and other regional flood factors, protect structures to the flood protection elevation, anchor structures to foundations to resist flotation and lateral movement, and insure that structural walls and floors are watertight to the flood protection elevation, and the interior remains completely dry during flooding without human intervention. Floodproofing measures could include reinforcing walls and floors to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or adding mass or weight to prevent flotation, placing essential utilities above the flood protection elevation, installing surface or subsurface drainage systems to relieve foundation wall and basement floor pressures, constructing water supply wells and waste treatment systems to prevent the entry of flood waters, or putting cutoff valves on sewer lines or eliminating gravity flow basement drains. 
Low flood hazard potential structures such as industrial, commercial and park loading areas, parking areas, boat ramps, and airport landing strips provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the structure has low flood damage potential, the structure is associated with permanent open space uses or are functionally dependent on a waterfront location and the structure will not obstruct flow of flood waters or cause any increase in flood elevations upstream or downstream based on a cross-section elevation view of the proposal, perpendicular to the watercourse, showing if the proposed development will obstruct flow or an analysis calculating the effects of this proposal on regional flood height. 
Flood storage district development may only be permitted by the Committee if compatible with the land use plan and the zoning district, is contiguous to other lands lying outside the floodplain, streets servicing the property shall be located outside the floodplain, and if an equal volume of storage, as defined by the ground surface and the regional flood elevation, shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, the development shall not affect the conveyance capacity by causing an obstruction to flow or storage capacity of the floodplains, such that it causes any increase in the regional flood height or discharge. Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered as providing an equal volume of storage. If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed. Any structure or building used for human habitation (seasonal or permanent) which is to be erected in a flood storage district which is to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, structurally altered or moved into the flood storage district shall be placed on fill with the finished surface of the lowest floor, excluding basement or crawlway, at or above the flood protection elevation. Fill shall be at least one foot above the regional flood elevation and shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of any structure or building erected thereon and dryland access shall be provided. If any such structure or building has a basement or crawlway, the surface of the floor of the basement or crawlway shall be at or above the regional flood elevation and shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in accordance with NR116.16. No variance may be granted to allow any floor below the regional flood elevation. 
Floodplain uses not prohibited in section 74-173 are conditional uses and shall also comply, provided the use is also permitted in the zoning district and the use shall be floodproofed by means other than filling to an elevation at or above the 100 year recurrence interval flood. 
The Committee shall request a review of each such floodplain use by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and await their recommendations before taking final action, but not to exceed 60 days. A copy of the Committee's decision on such application shall be forwarded by the Zoning Administrator to the Department within ten days of each decision. 
Shoreland special vegetation removal plan allowing greater vegetation removal than that permitted for the view/access corridor in section 74-174 shall require a conditional use permit after public hearing by the Committee. Applicant shall include a survey of the lot providing the following information: location of parking, topography of the land, existing vegetation, proposed cutting, and proposed replanting.

Sec. 74-188. Agricultural and related uses.
Except where specifically permitted as a principal use in division 3, the following agricultural and related uses shall be conditional uses and may be permitted as specified. All conditional uses in the A-1 district (farmland preservation district) are limited to those where the use and its location are consistent with the purposes of the farmland preservation zoning district; the use and its location in the farmland preservation zoning district are reasonable and appropriate, considering alternative locations, or are specifically approved under State or Federal law; the use is reasonably designed to minimize conversion of land at and around the site of the use, from agricultural use or open space use; the use does not substantially impair or limit the current or future agricultural use of surrounding parcels of land that are zoned for or legally restricted to agricultural use; and construction damage to land remaining in agricultural use is minimized and repaired, to the extent feasible.

Sec. 74-190. Residential and related uses.
Except where specifically permitted as a principal use in division 3, the following residential and quasi-residential uses shall be conditional uses and may be permitted as specified. In approving or disapproving the location of a conditional use, the Committee shall view the proposed site or sites and shall consider such evidence as may be presented at the public hearing bearing upon the general purpose and intent of this ordinance set forth in section 74-153 and 74-154, and upon the particular land use problems related to development of the site or sites as proposed. 
(1)	Conservation development design. 
a.	Applicability. Conservation development design may be used on a voluntary basis for all residential developments with five or more dwellings in the A-2, C-2, C-3, R-1, R-2, R-2A and R-3 zoning districts and requires conditional use approval. 
b.	Intent. 
1.	To conserve conservation land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodlands and wetlands, by protecting them from development. Where applicable, conservation land shall be laid out in general accordance with the wide, open space networks advocated by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, to encourage protection of an interconnected system of conservation lands. 
2.	To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs and the amount of paving required for residential development. 
3.	To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation, and by minimizing development on steep slopes. 
4.	To provide for a diversity of lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and residential preferences, so that the community's population diversity may be maintained. 
5.	To conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the adopted County Land Use Plan. 
6.	To create neighborhoods with direct access to open land, with amenities in the form of conservation land. 
7.	To provide for the conservation and maintenance of conservation land within the county to achieve the above-mentioned goals and for active or passive recreational use by residents. 
8.	To provide multiple options for landowners in order to minimize impacts on environmental resources (sensitive lands such as wetlands, floodlands, and steep slopes) and disturbance of natural or cultural features (such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic buildings, and fieldstone walls. 
9.	To provide standards that preserve the unique characteristics of individual properties so that their special or noteworthy features may be designed around and conserved. 
10.	To encourage the protection of the elements of the county's beauty and rural character. 
c.	General regulations for conservation development design: The design of all new subdivisions and other development projects using conservation design shall be governed by the following requirements for the A-2, C-2, C-3, R-1, R-2, R-2A, and R-3 districts: 
1.	Conservation development application, procedure, and approval process: The developer/applicant must follow the conservation development application, procedure, and approval process as identified in section 4.11 of the county subdivision control ordinance. 
2.	Site design. A site context map, existing resources and site analysis map, and sketch plan overlay sheet shall be prepared, as required by sections 5-A., 5-A.1, 5-A.2, and 5-A.3 of the county subdivision control ordinance. All conservation-design development projects shall use the four-step design process for conservation subdivision set forth in section 5-A.4 of the subdivision control ordinance. 
3.	The calculation of site capacity, or the number of dwelling units permitted on a site, shall be based on net buildable area (NBA). The site capacity shall be obtained by dividing the net buildable area within each district by the residential density allowed in the district. Fractional dwelling yield totals may not be combined between different zoning district. The applicant shall determine the net buildable area (NBA) using the following method, substantiated by sufficient plans and data to verify the calculations: 
Gross tract area: _____ acres 
From the gross tract area, subtract the following: 
All lands located within existing and proposed street rights-of-way: _____ acres 
All wetland areas: _____ acres 
All of the area located within a pond, lake, or stream channel: _____ acres 
The result is the net buildable area (NBA): _____ acres 
Note: Where two or more categories overlap, the overlapping acreage shall be counted only once, using the most restrictive classification. 
d.	Uses for the A-2, C-2, C-3, R-1, R-2, R-2A, and R-3 districts: 
1.	All residential accessory structures are permitted subject to limitations of division 2.

The endowment fund may also be used to cover the cost of any insurance required of the holder of the conservation easement. This density bonus is only considered when a conservation easement is held on undivided conservation land. A density bonus can not be considered when a conservation easement is obtained on an individual subdivision lot or lots. The County and the local unit of government shall review any maintenance agreement and endowment fund established by the subdivider and the nonprofit conservation organization or public agency. 
12.	A five percent density bonus shall be allowed for providing for the reuse or preservation of historical structure(s) located on a site.

(Ord. No. 446-07/07, pt. II, 7-10-07; Ord. No. 575-09/09, pt. XXI, 9-8-09)
 
Sec. 74-239. Rules.
The county board hereby adopts rules for the conduct of the business of the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. The board may adopt further rules as necessary. 
(1)	Meetings. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and shall be open to the public. 
(2)	Minutes to be kept. Minutes of the proceedings and a record of all actions shall be kept by the board, showing the vote of each member upon each question, the reasons for the board's determination, and its finding of facts. These records shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.

The 12 months to be calculated from effective date of the Walworth County Board of Adjustment's decision. 
 
Sec. 74-240. Powers.
The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
(1)	Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator. 
(2)	Variances. To hear and authorize appeals for variances where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. Such variance shall not be contrary to the public interest and shall be so conditioned that the spirit and purposes of this ordinance shall be observed and the public health, safety and welfare preserved and substantial justice done. 
(3)	Limitation on variances. No variances shall have the affect of permitting any use in a district that is prohibited in that district. 
(4)	Boundary disputes. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the floodplain boundary line shall be settled after a review and recommendation by the county zoning agency. 
a.	If a floodplain boundary is established by approximate or detailed floodplain studies, the flood elevations or profiles shall prevail in locating the boundary. The regional or base flood elevation shall govern if there are any discrepancies. Where flood profiles do not exist, other evidence may be examined. 
b.	In all cases, the person contesting the boundary location shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present arguments and technical evidence to the board. 
c.	If the boundary is incorrectly mapped, the board should notify the person contesting the boundary location to petition the governing body for a map amendment according to division 12. 
(5)	Substitutions. To hear and grant applications for substitution of more or equally restrictive nonconforming uses for existing nonconforming uses provided no structural alterations are to be made and the county zoning administrator has made a review and recommendation. Whenever the board permits such a substitution, the use may not thereafter be changed without application. 
(6)	Unclassified uses. To hear and grant applications for unclassified and unspecified uses provided that such uses are similar in character to the principal uses permitted in the district and the Committee and the county zoning administrator have made a review and recommendation. 
(7)	Special exceptions.
a.	The board of adjustment may hear and grant applications in accordance with requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act, the Wisconsin Fair Housing Acts or the Americans with Disabilities Act. Before the board of adjustment may grant permission to construct a deck, patio, walkway or second access to a pier (tram) in a location that would otherwise not be allowed by ordinance, the board of adjustment must find that the request is by disabled persons who reside on the parcel and the applicant would have to show that a structure with smaller dimensions would not be adequate to allow the disabled person access to the residence or pier. The permit shall be temporary, may continue only as long as disabled persons reside on the parcel and shall be removed not more than 30 days after the disabled person vacates the parcel. The board of adjustment may require the filing of a deed restriction in the register of deeds office to assure removal of the structure in accordance with the stipulation of the approval. A structure no larger than is necessary to allow the disable person to get in and out of the building, would not significantly undermine the basic purpose of the zoning ordinance, especially since they are temporary. 
b.	The board of adjustment may hear and grant special exception applications for a substitution in the use of an existing structure that is substandard because it does not conform with the required yards when: 
1.	The substitution requires a change in the zone district of the parcel to a district that allows generally less intense use(s), and; 
2.	Provided the proposed district or use requires lesser or equal setback requirements than the existing district. 
(8)	Temporary uses.

(Ord. No. 575-09/09, pt. XXIII, 9-8-09)
 
Sec. 74-242. Hearings.
The board of adjustment shall determine a reasonable time and place for the hearing, publish a class two notice thereof and shall give due notice to the parties in interest, the zoning administrator, and the county zoning agency. At the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney. The board of adjustment may grant continuances or adjourn hearings from time to time. 
Due notice of all hearings on appeals for text or map interpretations or variances to the floodplain and shoreland provisions of this ordinance shall be given to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ten days prior to such hearing. 
 
Sec. 74-243. Findings.
No variance to the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted by the board unless it finds that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicated such in the minutes of its proceedings: 
(1)	Preservation of intent. No variance shall be granted that is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the district in which the development is located. No variance shall have the affect of permitting a use in any district that is not a stated principal use, or conditional use where a conditional use permit has been granted. 
(2)	Unnecessary hardship. Unnecessary hardship exists when compliance would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. Consideration shall be given to the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance, its effects on the property, and the short-term, long-term and cumulative effects of granting the variance on the neighborhood, the community and on the public interests. Self-imposed or self-created hardships shall not be considered as grounds for the granting of a variance. Economic or financial hardship does not justify a variance. The property bears the burden of proving unnecessary hardship exists. The board shall consider the property as a whole rather than a portion of the parcel when determining unnecessary hardship. 
(3)	Unique property limitations. Unique physical limitations of the property must be physical limitations such as steep slopes, or wetlands that are not generally shared by other properties must prevent compliance with the ordinance. The circumstances of an applicant (growing family, need for a larger garage, etc) are not a factor in deciding variances. Nearby ordinance violations, prior variances or lack of objections from neighbors do not provide a basis for granting a variance. 
(4)	No harm to public interests. A variance may not be granted which results in harm to public interests. In applying this test, the board must consider the impacts of the proposal and the cumulative impacts of similar projects on the interests of the neighbors, the entire community and the general public. These interests are listed in the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance and may include public health, safety and welfare, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, natural scenic beauty, minimization of property damages, provision of efficient public facilities and utilities, achievement of eventual compliance for nonconforming uses, structures and lots, and other public interest issues." 
(5)	Additional requirements in floodplains.
a.	No variance shall be granted where filling and development contrary to the purpose and intent of this ordinance would result. 
b.	The variance may not cause any increase in the regional flood elevation. 
c.	Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, shall be the minimum relief necessary, shall not cause increased risks to public safety or nuisances, shall not increase costs for rescue and relief efforts and shall not be contrary to the purpose and intent of the ordinance. 
d.	Variances can only be granted for lots that are less than one-half acre and are contiguous to existing structures constructed below the RFE. 
e.	Variances shall not grant, extend or increase any use prohibited in the zoning district. 
f.	Variances shall not damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area. 
g.	Variances shall not allow actions without the amendments to this ordinance or map(s) required in division 12. 
h.	Variances shall not allow any alteration of an historic structure, including its use, which would preclude its continued designation as an historic structure. 
i.	When a variance is granted, the board shall notify the applicant in writing that it may increase flood insurance premiums and risks to life and property. A copy shall be maintained with the variance record."

Sec. 74-244. Decision.
The board of adjustment shall decide all appeals and applications within 30 days after the final hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the board's decisions to the appellant or applicant and the zoning administrator. 
(1)	Conditions may be placed upon any zoning permit ordered or authorized by the board. 
(2)	Variances, substitutions, or use permits granted by the board shall expire within 12 months unless substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant. 
(3)	A copy of all decisions interpreting the ordinance, text or maps, or granting or denying a variance to the floodplain and shoreland provisions of this ordinance shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Board to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources within ten days after the issuance of the decision.

3.	LOMCs Superseded 
The modifications effected by the LOMCs listed below have not been reflected on the final revised FIRM panels because they are being superseded by new detailed flood hazard information or the information available was not sufficient to make a determination. The reason each is being superseded is noted below. These LOMCs will no longer be in effect when the revised FIRM becomes effective. 
LOMC 	Case No. 	Date Issued 	Project Identifier 	Reason Determination will be Superseded 
			NO CASES RECORDED 	

1)	Insufficient information available to make a determination. 
2)	Lowest adjacent grade and lowest finished floor are below the proposed base flood elevation. 
3)	Lowest ground elevation is below the proposed base flood elevation. 
4)	Revised hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. 
5)	Revised topographic information. 
4.	LOMC's To Be Redetermined 
The LOMC's in Category 2 above will be revalidated through a single revalidation letter that reaffirms the validity of the determination in the previously issued LOMC. For LOMC's issued for multiple lots or structures where the determination for one or more of the lots or structures has changed, the LOMC cannot be revalidated through this administrative process. Therefore, we will review the data previously submitted for the LOMC requests listed below and issue a new determination for the affected properties after the effective date of the revised FIRM. 
LOMC 	Case No. 	Date Issued 	Project Identifier 	Reason Determination will be Superseded
