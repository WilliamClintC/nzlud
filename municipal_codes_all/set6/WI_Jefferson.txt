A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall bedeemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested.However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length oftime represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request.

Except as provided below, no request may be refused because theperson making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request.

.

If a written request isdenied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons fordenying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the requestfor the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for awrit of mandamus under § 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the Attorney General or adistrict attorney.
§ 81-6. Limitations on right to access.
As provided by § 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt from inspection under thischapter:
Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to beexempted from disclosure by state law.
Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes iffederal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure isa condition to receipt of aids by the state.

Purpose and intent.
This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children inthe City of Jefferson from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations closeto their residences. The City finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat topublic safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely thanany other type of offender to be rearrested for a new sexual assault. Given the high rate ofrecidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important tominimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate orplay in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools, day-care centers and other places children frequent.
It is not the intent of the City to punish sex offenders, but rather to serve the City's compellinginterest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of theCity of Jefferson by creating areas around certain locations where children regularlycongregate in concentrated numbers, wherein, certain sexual offenders are prohibited fromestablishing temporary or permanent residence.

Sewerage service charges. There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land,building, premises or unit having a connection with the wastewater works a sewerage servicecharge based upon the quantity of wastewater discharged, pursuant to § 66.0821, Wis. Stats., asamended or renumbered from time to time. Such sewerage service charges shall be billed to theperson owning, using or occupying the property served. The sewerage service charges, with theexception of residential customers, shall consist of a fixed monthly and a variable charge as setforth in the following sections. Residential-class sewerage service charges shall consist of a fixedcharge only as set forth in the following section.
Fixed charge.
With the exception of residential customers, the fixed monthly charge shall be a minimummonthly charge based, in part, upon the number of meters connected to the wastewaterworks and, in part, upon the size of such meter or meters. Significant contributors shall have aseparately computed fixed charge which will exclude bond depreciation, bond reserveaccount and new debt retirement (other than I/I) components from the fixed charge shown inthe following schedule, such components to be paid for pursuant to §
230-3
of this article.Residential customers will be placed into one of three tiers based on average water use asdescribed in Subsection

Special assessments. Not included in the sewerage service charges above are the costsassociated with providing local collecting facilities to users, which the City may assess by specialassessment, in whole or in part, to the property benefited thereby.
Residential fixed charge. Residential sewer customers shall pay a fixed monthly charge, as setforth in Subsection
B(3)
for all months. The following method for calculating the volume shall beused to determine which of three tiers the residential customer falls:
During the month of May each year, the Water Utility shall calculate the four-month averagewater usage for each residential customer. The four-month average shall be based on theactual water usage during the preceding four-month period (January through April, inclusive).The calculated average shall be used for each respective residential customer's sewer chargeand determine which billing tier the customer will be placed for the next 12 months.
If a residential customer is establishing new service during the year and no average waterusage can be determined, the customer shall be placed into the 301 to 600 cubic feet usagetier.
§ 230-6. Sewer connection fee.
Starting date. The starting date for the connection fees provided for in this section shall commencewith any sewer connections occurring on or after January 1, 2002. Connection fees are due andare based on the date that the building permit for any new sanitary service connection is issued.

§ 230-7. Annual audit.
The City shall conduct an annual audit, the purpose of which shall be to demonstrate the continuedproportionality and sufficiency of the user charges in system operation and maintenance costs,maintain accurate accounting records for the revenue and expenditures of the wastewater treatmentfacility and demonstrate the continued proportionality and sufficiency of the user charges relative tochanges in system operation, maintenance and replacement costs. Any changes in O, M & Rallocations shall be based upon sound engineering and accounting practices and the specific writtenopinion of a certified accountant or consulting engineer. The City shall have its accountants andengineers review the annuity rate and the actual replacement experience and maintenance practicesat the plant no less than once every three years to determine whether the annual revenue addition tothe replacement fund is at an appropriate level. The City may initiate such review at any time. If suchreviews indicate, the City will make appropriate alterations in the amounts of revenue collected for thereplacement fund and charges in treatment plant maintenance practices. Changes in the replacementfund amount shall be preceded by public hearing, and the City shall give express prior written notice ofsuch hearings to the significant contributors to the facility and also provide standard public hearingnotice to the public.
§ 230-8. Significant contributors.
Significant contributors shall be those users of the wastewater works whose discharges exceed, in oneor more parameters (flow, BOD, SS, and NH3-N), 5% of the design value for that particular parameter,on such average or peak basis as the approving authority determines is appropriate.
The City may allocate a portion of capacity in the wastewater treatment facilities to specificsignificant contributors, particularly in the case of new construction, expansion or renovation ofsuch facilities. Significant contributors will then pay capital costs associated with such allocatedcapacity.
Significant contributors will be encouraged to contract with the City as to the amount of suchallocated capacity and as to the payment of associated capital costs. In exchange for a contractualcommitment to pay such capital costs, the City may protect the contracting significant contributorsfrom certain capital cost increases that might otherwise result in the absence of such a contract.
Significant contributors will be requested to advise the City of their best estimate of the level ofusage of the wastewater treatment facilities that they expect to utilize through the remaining useful

life of those facilities. Significant contributors who have provided reasonable projected usagelevels to the City prior to a project of construction, expansion or renovation shall, in the absence ofcontract provision to the contrary, have their fixed charge computed on the basis of reasonableprojected usage levels. The City may change the amount of allocated capacity from theprojections provided by the significant contributors, provided that any opportunity for such changeis made available to all significant contributors.
Significant contributors who connect to the system after any specific construction, expansion orrenovation project may only be allocated capacity in that project to the extent the approvingauthority deems such capacity is available. In no event may capacity allocated to a significantcontributor under a wastewater service with the City be changed in any way without compliancewith the terms of the contract. Significant contributors who do not have a contractual commitmentto pay specific capital charges may have their allocated capacities and associated capital chargesreduced on a prospective basis if, in the judgment of the approving authority, the reallocatedportion of the capacity should be made available to another user.

Plans forinstallation of the control manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall beapproved by the approving authority prior to the beginning of construction.
Metering and sampling of high-strength or toxic wastes.
General. Users designated by the approving authority with high levels of flow or high-strengthdischarge may be required to have monitoring facilities. The approving authority shall make adetermination as to when metering of high levels of flow is needed as well as what frequencyof sampling of high-strength wastewater is needed. Metering and sampling devices shall beinstalled, owned and maintained by the discharger subject to the approval of the approvingauthority. Access to the sampling and metering location shall be granted to the approvingauthority or its duly authorized representative at all times.
Metering. Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater discharge may be required by theapproving authority if the volume cannot otherwise be determined from the metered waterconsumption records.
Sampling. Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to periodicinspections and a determination of character and concentration of such wastes. Samplingshall be conducted in such a manner as to be representative of the composition of the waste.Every care shall be exercised in collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a statecomparable to that at the time the sample was taken. Sampling may be accomplished eithermanually or by the use of mechanical equipment acceptable to the approving authority. Theuse of flow-proportional composite sampling is preferred.
Maintenance. A maintenance schedule shall be accepted by the approving authority. Allmaintenance and equipment repair shall be performed within a reasonable time asdetermined by the approving authority. Failure to perform maintenance within a reasonabletime shall be subject to the same forfeiture and procedural provisions as applied to violationsunder this article. Prior to completion of satisfactory repairs, and for any preceding periodduring which the approving authority determines there existed a malfunction, error or bias inthe metering and sampling, the volume and strength of the wastewater for that perioddischarged by the discharger shall be based on historical data and a reasonable engineeringestimate of flow and strength, taking account of material known production variations, all asdetermined by the approving authority in consultation with the discharger. If prolonged periodsof breakdown are anticipated, approved interim measuring and sampling needs shall beprovided and used to determine the volume and strength of wastewater. Following approvaland installation of permanent or temporary metering or sampling equipment, such equipmentshall not be removed without the consent of the approving authority.

by
Ord. No. 15-07
]
§ 232-1. Purpose; statutory authority.
The City Council finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges drainingto the Rock River watershed and to the Crawfish River watershed is a matter that affects the health,safety and welfare of the City, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. Inaddition, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Wisconsin Department of NaturalResources have implemented new standards for stormwater management that may eventually requiresignificant upgrades to the existing stormwater practices of the City, without any funding to assist incomplying with these new standards. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitarysewer utility operations of the City by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration andinflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause erosion of lands, threatenresidences and businesses with water damage and create environmental damage to the rivers withinand adjacent to the City. A system for the collection and disposal of stormwater provides services to allproperties within the City and surrounding areas, including properties not currently served by thesystems. The cost of operating and maintaining the City Stormwater Management System andfinancing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extentpracticable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. In order to protect thehealth, safety and welfare of the public, the City Council hereby exercises its authority to establish astormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services, adopting andpublishing as required by law the regulations contained in this section. The City is acting pursuant tothe authority granted by Chapters 62 and 66, Wis. Stats., including but not limited to Sections 62.04,62.11, 62.16, 62.175, 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0809, 66.0811 and 66.0821.
§ 232-2. Utility created.
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the City Council hereby exercises itsauthority to establish the Jefferson Stormwater Utility. The management, operation and control of theJefferson Stormwater Utility shall be vested in the City Council. The City Administrator or his/herdesignee will oversee the Utility.
§ 232-3. Applicability; abrogation and greater restrictions;interpretation.
Applicability. This article applies to all parcels within the incorporated boundaries of the City ofJefferson.
Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impairor interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules,regulations, ordinances or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However,wherever this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall govern.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be liberallyconstrued in favor of the City of Jefferson and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of anyother power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.

shall the site's existing sediment control level or trapping efficiency be reduced as a resultof the redevelopment.
Oil and grease control. For all stormwater plans for commercial or industrial developmentsand all other uses where the potential for pollution by oil or grease, or both, exists, the first 0.5inch of runoff will be treated using the best oil and grease removal technology available. Thisrequirement may be waived by the City Engineer only when the applicant can demonstratethat installation of such practices is not necessary.
Runoff rate control, hydrologic calculations. All runoff calculations shall be according to themethodology described in the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Technical Release55, Urban Hydrology For Small Watersheds (commonly known as "TR-55"), or othermethodology approved by the Jefferson County Conservationist. For agricultural land subjectto this section, the maximum runoff curve number (RCN) used in such calculations shall be 51for HSG A, 68 for HSG B. 79 for HSG C and 84 for HSG D. The TR-55 specified curvenumbers for other land uses shall be used. Heavily disturbed sites shall be lowered onepermeability class for hydrologic calculations. Lightly disturbed areas require no modification.Where practices have been implemented to restore soil structure to predeveloped conditions,no permeability class modification is required.
Runoff rate control, design standards. All stormwater facilities shall be designed, installed andmaintained to effectively accomplish the following:
Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm event(2.9 inches over 24 hours' duration).
Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm event(4.2 inches over 24 hours' duration).
Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hourstorm event (six inches over 24 hours' duration).
Outlets. Discharges from new construction sites must have a stable outlet capable of carryingthe designed flow as required in Subsection
B(4)
at a nonerosive velocity. Outlet design mustconsider flow capacity and flow duration. This requirement applies to both the site outlet andthe ultimate outlet to stormwater conveyance or waterbody.
Infiltration.
Design practices to infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that postdevelopment infiltrationvolume shall be at least 90% of the predevelopment infiltration volume, based uponaverage annual rainfall. If, when designing appropriate infiltration systems more than 1%of the site is required to be used as effective infiltration area for residential developmentor more than 2% of the site is required to be used as effective area for nonresidentialdevelopment, the applicant may alternately design infiltration systems and pervioussurfaces to meet or exceed an annual recharge rate of 7.6. inches per year. If thisalternative design approach is taken, at least 1% of the site must be used for infiltration inresidential developments and at least 2% of the site must be used for infiltration innonresidential developments. For redevelopment projects, the infiltration requirementsshall be applied only to the area that was not impervious when the project began.
Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required. The pretreatmentshall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduledmaintenance and to protect groundwater quality. Where appropriate, pretreatment forother runoff constituents that represent a threat of groundwater contamination may berequired.

Areas within 1,000 feet up gradient or within 100 feet down gradient of karstfeatures.
Areas with less than three feet separation distance from the bottom of the infiltrationsystem to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock, exceptthat this provision does not prohibit infiltration of roof runoff.
Areas with runoff from industrial, commercial and institutional parking lots and roadsand residential arterial roads with less than five feet separation distance from thebottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or thetop of bedrock.
Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as specified in § NR811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial andinstitutional land uses or regional devices for residential development.
Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in § NR 720.03(2), Wis. Adm.Code, are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur.
Any area where the soil does not exhibit one of the following characteristics betweenthe bottom of the infiltration system and the seasonal high groundwater and top ofbedrock: at least a three-foot soil layer with 10% fines or greater. This provision doesnot apply where the soil medium within the infiltration system provides an equivalentlevel of protection and does not prohibit infiltration of roof runoff.
Alternate use for runoff. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toiletflushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be given equal credit toward theinfiltration volume required by this section.
Minimizing groundwater pollution. According to Ch. NR 151, Wis Adm. Code, infiltration systemsdesigned in accordance with this section shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible,minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with thepreventative action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Ch. NR 140, WisAdm. Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with the preventionaction limit is not achievable, the infiltration system may not be installed or shall be modified toprevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable in the absolute discretion of the City.Stormwater management goals: The following standards shall be met whenever possible, andproposed design, suggested location and implementation of practice to meet these goals shall beincluded in plans:
For existing development, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 40 microns onthe site (reduction of 20%), resulting from a one-year twenty-four-hour storm event, accordingto approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension.
For street reconstruction, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 20 microns onthe site (reduction of 40%) resulting from a one-year twenty-four-hour storm event, accordingto approved procedures and assuming no sediment resuspension.

§ 277-4. Lead water service lateral replacement program.
[Added
4-18-2017
by
Ord. No. 7-17
]
Lead water service lateral replacement requirement.
Every water service lateral connected to the Jefferson Utility Water System (Utility) should bemade of suitable material as determined by the Jefferson Utility Commission.
Intent and purpose. The Common Council of the City of Jefferson finds that it is in the publicinterest to establish a comprehensive voluntary program for the removal and replacement oflead water laterals in use within both the public Utility and in private systems and to that enddeclares the purposes of this section to be as follows:
To ensure the water quality at every tap of Utility customers meets the water qualitystandards specified under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act;
[1]
and
Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.
To reduce the lead in City drinking water to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)standards and ideally to reduce lead contaminant level to zero in City drinking water forthe health of City residents; and
To eliminate the constriction of water flow caused by mineral rich groundwater flowingthrough lead water service pipes and the consequent buildup of mineral deposits insidelead pipes; and
To meet the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) requirements for localcompliance with the Lead and Copper Rule.
Owner to voluntarily replace lead service. Existing lead water service laterals connected tothe Utility may be replaced with water service laterals made of suitable materials and at theowner's expense. Replacement may be completed either before or in conjunction with thenext water main project servicing the lateral to the affected property.
Affected property owners may contract with a licensed contractor to complete thereplacement. If the property owner selects this option, the lead water service lateralshould be replaced before the Utility replaces the main or during construction; or
If available, affected property owners may have the Utility contractors complete thereplacement.
The Utility may, as part of any water main project, add an alternative to the Utility'scontract requesting unit bid prices for the calculation of the cost for private leadwater service lateral replacement. This will include removing the entire lateral fromthe main to the water meter inside of the dwelling or building and replacing leadpiping with suitable material.
If available and should the property owner select this option, the property owner willbe charged the entire cost of the removal and replacement. In addition, allrestoration on the private property will be the responsibility of the property owner (forexample, top soil, concrete, steps, asphalt, bushes, and porches).

The notification should be at least 60 days prior to thecommencement of the water main construction, and shall be issued by the Jefferson Utilities.
Inspection required. The Jefferson Utilities Manager, or his/her designee, shall inspect allprivate connections to the public water mains for presence of lead or lead causing pipes priorto, if possible, or at the time that the Utility water main is to be reconstructed. If it is unable togain access for inspection, Jefferson Utilities may pursue an inspection warrant. In the eventthe lateral is found to contain lead the Utility Manager, or his/her designee, shall notify theowner, in writing, by United States Mail within 10 working days, of the fact, along withinformation about the City's Lead Water Service Replacement Program. The affected propertyowner may provide proof of arrangements for replacement of the private lead water servicelateral within 90 days of the date of the notification letter.

General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regionalflood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other mapsapproved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the FloodInsurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Otherregulatory zones are displayed as A and AO Zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may bederived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictiveinformation shall apply.
Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE,AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Anychange to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplainor floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed andapproved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (see §
286-8
,Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall beeffective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the City ofJefferson Municipal Building, 317 S. Main Street, Jefferson, Wisconsin 53549.

Official maps. Based on the FIS:
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Panel Nos. 55055C0195E, 55055C0310E, datedJune 2, 2009, and Panel Nos. 55055C0187F, 55055C0189F, 55055C0191F,55055C0193F, 55055C0302F, 55055C0306F, dated February 4, 2015; withcorresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) datedFebruary 4, 2015, Volume Nos. 55055CV001B and 55055CV002B.
Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided intothree districts as follows:
The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of thefloodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and arecontained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and thefloodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) are those areas that may be covered byfloodwater during the regional flood and do not have a BFE or floodway boundarydetermined, including A, AH and AO Zones on the FIRM.

Locating floodplain boundaries.
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual fieldconditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection
E(4)(b)[1]
or
[2]
below. If asignificant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §
286-8
.
Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profileelevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment isrequired. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actualpredevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary wasdetermined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputesbetween the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shallbe settled according to §
286-7C(3)
and the criteria in Subsection
E(4)(b)[1]
and
[2]
below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from aFIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to §
286-8
,Amendments.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine thedistrict boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are anydiscrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall bedetermined by the map scale.
Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not begrounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above theregional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and themap is amended pursuant to §
286-8
, Amendments.
Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be incompliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federalregulations.

Flood Storage District. The Flood Storage District delineates that portion of the floodplain wherestorage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to reduce the regional flooddischarge. The district protects the flood storage areas and assures that any development in thestorage areas will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higherflood elevations.
Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the Flood Storage District(FSD), as shown on the official floodplain zoning maps.
Permitted uses. Any use or development which occurs in a Flood Storage District must meetthe applicable requirements in §
286-4C
.
Standards for development in Flood Storage Districts.
Development in a Flood Storage District shall not cause an increase equal or greaterthan 0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional flood.
No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equalvolume of storage as defined by the predevelopment ground surface and the regionalflood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development tocompensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory storage). Excavationbelow the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage.
If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless theentire area zoned as Flood Storage District - on this waterway - is rezoned to theFloodfringe District. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done forthe waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplainstorage, as per §
286-8
, Amendments, of this chapter.
No area may be removed from the Flood Storage District unless it can be shown that thearea has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other landslying outside of the floodplain.
§ 286-6. Nonconforming uses.
General.
Applicability. If these standards conform with § 59.69(10), Wis. Stats., for counties or§ 62.23(7)(h), Wis. Stats., for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications oradditions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premiseswhich was lawful before the passage of this chapter or any amendment thereto.
The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with theprovisions of this chapter may continue subject to the following conditions:
No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permittedunless they comply with this chapter. The words "modification" and "addition" include, butare not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding orreplacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use.Maintenance is not considered a modification; this includes painting, decorating, panelingand other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement ofexisting private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Anycosts associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not considered maintenance.The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent tothe exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. Theroof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safeingress and egress to the principal structure.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities and 87.30 and281.31, Wis. Stats.
§ 290-2. Finding of fact and purpose.
Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipalitywould adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the taxbase. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments,nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands andother aquatic habitat;
Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover andcontrolling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earthmoving activities.
§ 290-3. Compliance and zoning permit required.
The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the municipality shallbe in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federalregulations. (However, see §
290-12
of this chapter for the standards applicable to nonconforminguses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwiseexpressly excluded by a provision of this chapter.
§ 290-4. Municipalities and state agencies regulated.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to complywith this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if§ 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of statehighways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when § 30.12(4)(a),Wis. Stats., applies.
§ 290-5. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes all provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under § 61.35,62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that whereanother municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shallcontinue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenantsor easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of thischapter shall prevail.

NR 117 standards in effect on the date ofthe adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.
§ 290-7. Annexed areas.
The Jefferson County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effectand shall be administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7,1982. These annexed lands are described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map. The JeffersonCounty shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering thissection and are on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator.
§ 290-8. Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps.
The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this chapter and are on file in the office ofthe City Clerk/Treasurer:

§ 290-9. District boundaries.
The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the municipality which are five acresor more and are shown on the Final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made apart of this chapter and which are:
Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages.Lakes, ponds or flowages in the municipality shall be presumed to be navigable if they areshown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base mapswhich have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter.
Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to thelandward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall bepresumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittentwaterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning basemaps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. FloodplainZoning Maps adopted in §
290-8B
shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas.
Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by theZoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact theappropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinaryhigh-water mark.
When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown onthe Official Zoning Maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the ZoningAdministrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the

Preamble. The City of Jefferson has an inherent interest in maintaining the quality of landdivision and the orderly layout and use of land and preventing undue concentration ofpopulation using private sanitary systems and private wells, so as to protect the groundwaterand the environment and to ensure the best possible environment for human occupation. TheCity is also interested in limiting the potential impact that future development in theextraterritorial areas will have on City-provided services, such as City parks, police servicesand streets. The City has an interest in promoting the wise use, conservation, protection andproper development of the extraterritorial areas soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildliferesources and to attain a proper adjustment of land use and development to the supportingand sustaining of a natural resource base. The Citys interest is to further the ordinary layoutand appropriate use of land and to provide adequate light and air and to prevent theovercrowding of land and to regulate and control urban sprawl and improve the quality ofdevelopment. The City desires to preserve natural vegetation and cover and promote thenatural beauty of the extraterritorial area. It is in the Citys interests to promote the goals andplans as set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, which is incorporated by reference,including preserving quality agricultural lands for that purpose when located in an areadesignated for preservation. The City further seeks to provide the best possible environmentfor human habitation and by encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout theCitys extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction. The City further declares goals to insure thatnew development will not be detrimental to the physical, social and economic well-being ofresidents of the City, to direct new growth to those areas capable of providing a full range ofurban services and facilities, to prevent scattered and noncontiguous development withoutdiscouraging new and desirable development and to discourage new developments in thoseareas that are premature in terms of planning and timing for the provision of adequate publicservices and facilities. Based upon the foregoing, it is necessary, in the interest of publichealth, safety and welfare, to establish minimum lot or parcel sizes for any lot or parcel in theCitys extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction provided for in § 236.10, Wis. Stats.
The minimum lot or parcel size for a lot or parcel to be used for residential purposes shall beone acre with a maximum density of one house per 35 acres. The minimum lot or parcel sizefor a lot or parcel to be used for a commercial, business or industrial use shall be 35 acres. Inorder to meet the minimum lot or parcel size requirements of this subsection, the lot or parcelshall be a single piece of contiguous land undivided by and excluding from area measurementany street, railroad right-of-way or navigable waterway.

Article VIII. Adult-Oriented Establishments

Editor's Note: Former Art. VIII, Signs, as amended, was repealed 5-20-2008 by Ord. No. 6-08. See nowCh.

, Signs.
§ 300-49. Findings of fact.
The Common Council finds that adult-oriented establishments, as defined and otherwise regulatedby the City, require special zoning in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfareof the City.
Based its review of studies conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, Garden Grove, California, LosAngeles, California, Whittier, California, Indianapolis, Indiana, Minneapolis, Minnesota, St. Paul,Minnesota, Cleveland, Ohio, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Amarillo, Texas, Austin, Texas,Beaumont, Texas, Houston, Texas, Seattle, Washington, and the findings incorporated in City ofRenton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Coleman A. Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976), the Common Council finds that there is convincing evidencethat the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments include an increased risk ofprostitution, high-risk sexual behavior, crime, and other deleterious effects upon existingbusinesses and surrounding residential areas, and decreased property values.
The Common Council intends to control the impact of these secondary effects in order to protectthe health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preservethe quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods andareas.
It is not the intent of the Common Council to suppress any speech activities protected by the FirstAmendment, but to enact a content-neutral article which addresses the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments while providing an outlet for First Amendment protected activities.
In order to minimize and control the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments upon theCity, it is the intent of the board to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented establishmentswithin a certain distance of each other and within a certain distance of other specified locationswhich are incompatible with and would suffer from the secondary effects of adult-orientedestablishments.
Based upon its review of materials linking alcohol consumption and high-risk sexual behavior andmaterials linking alcohol consumption and crimes such as sexual assault, the Common Councilfinds that a geographic separation of adult-oriented establishments from alcohol beveragelicensed premises is warranted.
The Common Council defines "adult-oriented establishment" as an adult arcade, adult bath house,adult body painting studio, adult bookstore, adult cabaret, adult motel, adult theater, and any

B(2)
,
(3)
and
(4)
above.
The measurements from a structure shall be taken from the farthest point a structure extends inthe direction of the measurement, including overhanging roofs or similar projections.
For adult-oriented establishments located in conjunction with other buildings and clearly separatefrom other establishments such as in a shopping center, measurements shall be taken from theboundaries of the space occupied by the adult-oriented establishment.
For any adult-oriented establishment located above ground level in a multi-story structure andclearly separate from other establishments within the structure, the distance measurements shallbe taken from the ground floor public entrance/exit nearest the adult-oriented establishment(excluding emergency exits).
A licensed adult-oriented establishment is not disqualified from holding an adult-orientedestablishment license by the location subsequent to the grant or renewal of its license of any ofthe establishments described in §
300-50B
, above, within 500 feet of the licensed premises. Thisprovision applies only to the renewal of an existing license and does not apply when an applicationfor a license is submitted after a license for that location has not been renewed or has beenrevoked.
