EDITOR'S NOTE
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a
codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code, article and section
number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the article
number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the section number is .06. The
code and article numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number
preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the article number being all
digits left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is I, the article number is 113
(or the 13th article within code I), and the section number is.lO.
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future leg isla tion.
Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions
are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the
original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the
event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For
example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede
575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date
and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time, or to its inclusion in
any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that the section contains new
matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified
Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more
sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given article.

be lawful for the Municipal Judge, City Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk, Mayor,
Chief of Police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police headquarters to
admit such person to bail upon the execution of a bond to the City in such an amount
as in the discretion of the officer will secure the prisoner's presence, conditioned
that the accused will appear upon a day named, before the Municipal Judge of the
City, to await trial; and every such bond taken shall be filed as soon as practicable
with the Municipal Court Clerk by the officer approving and taking such bond; and

Subdivision Regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variance shall not have effect of nullifying the
intent and purposes of these Regulations; and further provided the Zoning Board of

unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are
not applicable generally to other property.

chairman of the Commission, all applicants shall be required to
complete, in accordance with the Commission's decision and to
the satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary and
other improvements including lot improvements on the individual
lots of the subdivision as required in these Regulations, specified
in the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission,
and to dedicate same to the City, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus
dedicated.
(2) Escrow deposits for lot improvements.
A. Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, by reason of the
season of the year, any lot improvements required by the
Subdivision Regulations cannot be performed, the Zoning
Inspector may, nevertheless, issue a certificate of
occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety or
general welfare upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an
amount to be determined by the City Engineer for the cost
of such improvements. The performance bond covering such
lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect.

which escrow moneys have been accepted by the Zoning
Officer at the time of issuance of a certificate of
occupancy shall be installed by the developer within a period
of nine months from the date of deposit and issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. In the event that the
improvements have not been properly installed, at the end
of the time period, the Zoning Inspector shall give two
weeks' written notice to the developer requiring him to
install same, and in the event that same are not installed
properly in the discretion of the Zoning Officer, the Zoning
Officer may request the governing body to authorize the
City to proceed to contract out the work for the installation
of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the
amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow moneys
are being deposited with the Zoning Officer, the applicant
shall obtain and file with the Zoning Officer prior to
obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized
statement from the purchaser of the premises authorizing
the Zoning Officer to install the improvements at the end of
the nine-month period in the event that the same have not

67 Subdivision Application and Approval Process 1342.06
(3) Performance bond.
A. The Planning Commission in its discretion may waive the
requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all
public improvements prior to the signing of the subdivision
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond
at the time of application for final subdivision approval in
an amount estimated by the Commission as sufficient to
secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation
and dedication of the incompleted portion of required
improvements. The performance bond shall also secure all
lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as
required in these Regulations.
B. Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory
requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney
as to form sufficiency and manner of execution as set forth
in these Regulations. The period within which required
improvements must be completed shall be specified by the
Planning Commission in the resolution approving the final
subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond and
shall not in any event exceed two years from date of final
approval. Such bond shall be approved by the City as to the
amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
governing body. The Commission may, upon proof of
difficulty, recommend to the governing body extension of
the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum
period of one additional year. The City may at any time
during the period of such bond accept a substitution of
principal or sureties on the bond upon recommendation of
the Commission.
(4) Temporary improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements required by the Commission and
shall maintain same for the period specified by the Commission.
Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvements,
the developer shall file with the City a separate suitable escrow
deposit or bond for temporary facilities, which escrow deposit or
bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly
constructed, maintained and removed.
(5) Cost of improvements. All required improvements shall be made
by the applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by the
City or any improvement district therein.
(6) Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bonds
and contract provisions apply may file in lieu of such contract or
bond a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies
authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply wi th the
provisions of this article.
1342.06 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 68
(7) Failure to complete improvement. For subdivisions for which no
escrow deposit or performance bond has been posted, if the
improvements are not completed within the period specified by
the Commission in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where an escrow
deposit or performance bond has been posted and required
improvements have not been installed within the terms of such
performance bond, the City may thereupon declare the escrow
deposit or bond to be in default and require that all the
improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building
development at the time the escrow deposit or bond is declared to
be in default.
(8) Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks shall be
by ordinance of the City. The approval by the Commission of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the
acceptance by the City of any street, easement or park shown on
such plat. The Commission may require the plat to be endorsed
with appropriate notes to this effect.
(b) Inspection of Improvements.
(I) General procedure and fees. The Commission shall provide for
inspection of required improvements during construction and
insure their satisfactory completion.
The applicant shall pay to the City an inspection fee of two
percent (2%) of the amount of the performance bond or the
estimated cost of required improvements, and the subdivision plat
shall not be signed by the chairman of the Commission unless such
fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be
due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid.
If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
City's construction standards and specifications, the applicant
shall be responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever
the cost of improvements is covered by an escrow deposit or
performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be
severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements
according to specifications.
(2) Release or reduction of performance bond.
A. Certificate of satisfactory completion. The City shall not
accept dedica tion of required improvements, nor release nor
reduce a performance bond, until the City Engineer has
submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until
69 Subdivision Application and Approval Process 1342.06
the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the
City Engineer, through submission of detailed "as-built"
survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location,
dimensions, materials and other information required by the
Commission or City Engineer, that the layout of the line and
grade of all public improvements is in accordance with
construction plans for the subdivision and that a title
insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the
City Attorney indicating that the improvements shall have
been completed, are ready for dedication to the City and
are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances.
Upon such approval and recommendation, the governing
body shall thereafter accept the improvements for
dedication in accordance with the established procedure.
B. Reduction of escrow deposit or performance bond. An
escrow deposit or performance bond shall be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to
the ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to
the total public improvements for the plat. In no event shall
the escrow deposit or performance bond be so reduced below
twenty-five percent (25%) of the principal amount.
(c) Maintenance of Improvements.
(1) The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on
the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on
streets and sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of such
improvements by the City. If there are any certificates of
occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City, the City may on
twelve hours notice plow the street or effect emergency repairs
and charge same to applicant.
(2) The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond wi th
the City, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by
the City Engineer and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney,
in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required
improvements, including all lot improvements on the individual
subdivided lots for a period of one year after the date of their
acceptance by the City and dedication of same to the local
government.
(d) Deferral or Waiver of Required Improvements.
(1) The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of final
approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in
the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare, or
which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of
connecting facilities.
1342.06 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 70
(2) Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Commission to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of
connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay
his share of the costs of the future improvements to the City
prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, or the applicant may
post a bond insuring completion of such improvements upon
demand of the local government.
(e) Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy.
(1) Where an escrow deposit or performance bond has been required
for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in
the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the
improvements and dedication of same to the local government, as
required in the Commission's final approval of the subdivision plat.
(2) The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular
access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire
equipment, prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. The
developer shall at the time of the dedication submit moneys in
escrow to the City in a sum determined by the City Engineer for
the necessary final improvement of the street.
(3) No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent (10%)
of lots in a subdivision, or if ten percent (10%) is less than two,
for the final two lots of a subdivision, until all public
improvements required by the Commission for the plat have been
fully completed and dedicated to the City.
(f) Consumer Protection Legislation and Conflicts of Interest Statutes.
(1) No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or
issued if a developer or his authorized agent has violated any
federal, State or local law pertaining to consumer protection of
real estate land sales, promotion or practices, or any applicable
conflicts of interest legislation with respect to the lot or parcel
of land which is the subject of the permit or certificate, until so
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(2) With respect to such lot or parcel of land, in the event a building
permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or issued, it
shall be subject to revocation by the City until so ordered
otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that in
no event shall the rights of intervening innocent third parties in
possession of a certificate of occupancy be prejudiced by any such
revoca tion.
(3) Any violation of a federal, State or local consumer protection
law, including but not limited to: Postal Reorganization Act of
1970; the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1970; Interstate Land
Sales Full Disclosure Act; the Truth in Lending Act; the Uniform

1343.02 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 72
1343.02 SELF-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS.
If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the
subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning Ordinance or these
Regulations, such restrictions or references thereto are required to be indicated on
the subdivision plat, or the Planning Commission shall require that restrictive
covenants be recorded with the County Clerk in form to be approved by the City
Attorney.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.03 MONUMENTS.
The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision
as required herein and as approved by a registered land surveyor.
(a) Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at street
intersections, angle points of curve and block corners. They shall be
spaced so as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines being
contained wholly within the street limits.
(b) The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented in the
field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than thirty inches in
length, not less than four inches square or five inches in diameter, and
marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron rod or other durable
material securely embedded; or by iron rods or pipes at least thirty
inches long and two inches in diameter. These monuments shall be
placed not more than 1,400 feet apart in any straight line and at all
corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve changes
its radius, at all angle points in any line and at all angle points along the
meander line, such points to be not less than twenty feet back from the
bank of any river or stream, except that when such corners or points
fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shal1 be
placed in the side line of the street.
(c) All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to in
the preceding paragraph shall be monumented in the field by like
monuments as described above. These monuments shall be placed at all
block corners, at each end of all curves, at a point where a river
changes its radius and at all angle points in any line.
(d) The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be monumented
in the field by iron pipes at least thirty inches long and seven-eighths
inch in' diameter or by round or square iron bars at least thirty inches
long. These monuments shall be placed at the point of intersection of
the river or stream lot line, with a meander line established not less
than twenty feet back from the bank of the river or stream.
(e) All such monuments shall be set flush with the ground and planted in
such manner that they wiII not be removed by frost.
(f) All monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a
registered land surveyor prior to the time the Commission recommends

1343.04 CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features which
will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be
subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the Commission, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, to
solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set
aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.05 SUBDMSION NAME.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by
these Regulations. The Commission shall have final authority to designate the name
of the subdivision which shall be determined at sketch plat approval.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.06 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
(a) Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other condi tions, in securing
building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and
Health Regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from
an approved street.
(b) Lot Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum
standards of the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum
required area for the zonirig district, the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where
they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance and these Regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this
rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large
enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback
from both streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercia,! or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
(c) Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.
(I) Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
(2) Access from major and secondarv arterials. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary
street. Where driveway access from a major or secondary street
may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Commission may
require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazards on such street.
1343.07 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 74
Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid
requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major or secondary arterials.
(Ord. 86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.07 SOIL PRESERVATION, GRADING AND SEEDING.
(a) Soil Preservation and Final Grading. No certificate of occupancy shall
be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the approved
final subdivision plat and the lot precovered with soil with an average depth of at
least six inches which shall contain no particles over two inches in diameter over the
entire area of the lot, except that portion covered by buildings or included in
streets, or where the grade has not been changed or natural vegetation seriously
damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but
shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at
least four inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized
by seeding or planting.
(b) Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm draInage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to
avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.
(c) Lawn-Grass Seed and Sod. Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less
than four pounds to each 1,000 square feet of land area. In the spring, the seed shall
be sown between March 15 and May 15; and in the fall, the seed shall be sown
between August 15 and September 30. The seed shall consist of a maximum of ten
percent (10%) rye grass by weight and a minimum of ninety percent (90%) of
permanent bluegrass and/or fescue grass by weight. All seed shall have been tested
for germination within one year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing shall
be on the label containing the seed analysis. All lots shall be seeded from the
roadside edge of the unpaved right of way back to a distance of twenty-five feet
behind the principal residence on the lot. No certificate of occupancy shall be
issued until respreading of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that
between October I and March 15, and between May 15 and August 15, the applicant
shall submit an agreement in writing signed by the developer and the property
owner, with a copy to the Zoning Officer, that respreading of soil and seeding of
lawn will be done during the immediate following planting season as set forth in this
section, and leave · a cash escrow for performance in such amount as shall be
determined by the Zoning Inspector. Sod may be used to comply with any
requirement of seeding set forth herein.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.08 DEBRIS AND WASTE.
No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or other
waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any
lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and removal
of same shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy on a
subdivision. Nor shall any be left or depOSited in any area of the subdivision at the
time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of public improvements,
whichever is sooner.

75 Requirements for Improvements. Reservations and Design 1343.12
1343.09 FENCING.
Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous condition may exist.
The fences shall be constructed according to standards established by the
City Engineer and shall be noted as to height and material on the final plat. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the fence improvements have been
duly installed.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.10 WATER BODIES AND WATERCOURSES.
If a tract being subdivided contains a water body or portion thereof, lot lines
shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the
fees to adjacent lots. The Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed
that it will not become a City responsibility. No more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the minimum area of a lot required under the Zoning Ordinance may be
satisfied by land which is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable
area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for
installation of a culvert or other structure, of design approved by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.11 PERFORMANCE BOND TO INCLUDE LOT IMPROVEMENT.
The performance bond shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all
requirements contained in Section 1342.06 including, but not limited to, soil
preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris and
waste, fencing and all other lot improvements required by the Commission.
Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the expiration
of escrow deposit or the performance bond, the City may enforce the provisions of
the bond where the provisions of this section or any other applicable law, ordinance
or regulation have not been complied with.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.12 STREETS AND ROADS.
(a) General Requirements.
(1) Frontage on improved roads. No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access
from an existing street or:
A. An existing State highway; or
B. A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and
recorded in the County Clerk's office. Such street or
highway shall be suitably improved as required by the
highway rules, regulations, specifica tions or orders, or be
secured by a performance bond required under these
Subdivision Regulations, with the width and right of way
required by these Subdivision Regulations.
(2) Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and
improved and conform to the City construction standards and
specifications and shall be approved as to design and
specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance with the
construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plat
approval.
1343.12 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 76
(3) Topography and arrangement.
A. Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography.
Local roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid
conformity of lot appearance. All streets shall be arranged
so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at,
or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall
conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A
combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
Specific standards are contained in the design standards of
these Regula tions.
B. All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights of
way.
C. All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches and shopping centers; to population densities; and
to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
D. Minor and local streets shall be laid out to conform as much
as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through
traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and
to require the minimum number of streets necessary to
provide convenient and safe access to property.
E. The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not
necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets,
cul-de-sacs or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where
such use will result in a more desirable layout.
F. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of
the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography
or other physical condi tions, or unless in the opinion of the
Commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for
the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts.
G. In business and industrial developments, the streets and
other access ways shall be planned in connection wi th the
grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities and the
provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas,
and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including
pedestrian.
(4) Blocks.
A. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed
block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major
streets, railroads or waterways.
77 Requirements for Improvements. Reservations and Design 1343.12
B. The lengths, width and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development
contemplated, but block lengths in residential areas sha\l
not exceed 2,200 feet or twelve times the minimum lot
width required in the zoning district, nor be less than 400
feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major
arterials and co\lector streets shall be not less than 1,000
feet in length.
C. In long blocks the Commission may require the reservation
of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities,
drainage facilities Of pedestrian traffic.
Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide,
may be required by the Commission through the center of
blocks more than 800 feet long where deemed essential to
provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers, transportation or other community
facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses sha\l be of
such length and width as may be determined suitable by the
Commission for prospective use.
(5) Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission
may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the
following means:
A. The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary
arterial and front onto a para\lel local street; no access
sha\l be provided from the primary arterial, and screening
shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property
line of such lots.
B. A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short loops
entered from and designed genera\ly at right angles to such
a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the major arterial.
C. A marginal access or service road (separated from the
primary arterial by a planning or grass strip and having
access thereto a t suitable points).
(6) Road names. The sketch plat as submitted sha\l not indicate any
names upon proposed streets. The Commission sha\l approve the
name of all roads at the time of preliminary approval. The local
postmaster shaH be consulted by the Commission prior to
rendering its request to the Commission. Names sha\l be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road
names in the City so as not to cause confusion. A road which is or
is planned as a continuation of an existing road sha\l bear the
same name.
1343.12 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 78
(7) Road regulatory signs. The applicant shall deposit with the City
at the time of final subdivision approval the sum of fifty dollars
($50.00) for each road sign required by the City Engineer at all
road intersections. The City shall install all road signs before
issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on the
streets approved. Street name signs are to be placed at all
intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and
location of which to be approved by the City Engineer.
(8) Street lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by
the City Engineer.
(9) Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be
permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to
deny access from adjacent property to such street.
(10) Construction of roads and dead-end roads.
A. Construction of roads. The arrangement of streets shall
provide for the continuation of principal streets between
adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection or
efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street
temporarily, the right of way shall be extended to the
property line. A temporary T - or L- shaped turnabout shall
be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal
street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors whenever the
street is continued. The Commission may limit the length
of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the
design standards of these Regulations.
B. Dead-end road (permanent). Where a road does not extend
the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not
required by the Commission for access to adjoining
property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such
boundary that fifty feet. However, the Commission may
require the reservation of an appropriate easement to
accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic or
utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the
end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City
construction standards and specifica tions.
For greater convenience to traffic and more effective
police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets
shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the
design standards of these Regulations.
79 Requirements for Improvements. Reservations and Design 1343.12
(b) Design Standards.
(I) General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal,
sanitation and road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate
roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue
hardships to adjoining properties, the design standards for roads in
Table I are hereby required. Road classification shall be
determined by the Commission.
(2) Road surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water
utilities have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall
construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or cause to be
surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these Regulations.
All local and minor streets shall be paved with a concrete
pavement of a minimum thickness of seven inches or of asphaltic
concrete or other material of equivalent quality and shall be
provided with an adequate base as determined by accepted
engineering practice. Such surfacing shall be of such character as
is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar
improvements in the surrounding areas. Adequate provision shall
be made for culverts, drains and bridges.
All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and
structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all
construction standards and specifications adopted by the
Commission, City Engineer or City and shall be incorporated into
the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer
for pIa t approval.
(3) Excess right of way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the
standards designated in these Regulations shall be required
whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to
provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess
of three to one.
(4) Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights of way
and limited access highways where so located as to affect the
subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
A. In residential districts, a buffer strip at least twenty-five
feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot
required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the
railroad right of way or limited access highway. This strip
shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on
the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The
placement of structure hereon is prohibi ted".
B. In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial
uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately
parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a
sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for
commercial or industrial sites.
1343.12 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 80
C. Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street
which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent
practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the
railroad right of way. Such distance shall be determined
with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
(5) Intersections.
A. Streets shall . be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new
streets at an angle of less than seventy-five degrees shall
not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at
right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than
two streets shall intersect at anyone point unless
specifically approved by the Commission.
B. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any
existing intersections on the opposite side of such street.
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall
not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either
intersection. Where streets intersect major streets, their
alignment shall be continuous. Intersections of major
streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
C. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets
shall be at least twenty feet; and minimum curb radius at an
intersection involving a collector street shall be at least
twenty-five feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in
alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit
safe vehicular movement.
D. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an
intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not
grea ter than a two percent (2 %) ra te a t a distance of sixty
feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
E. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a
traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut
such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in
connection with the grading of the public right of way to the
extent deemed necessary to provide an adequa te sight
distance.
81 Requirements for Improvements. Reservations and Design 1343.13
F. The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shan
be three percent (3%) or less.
G. Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as
determined by the Commission, shan be constructed at the
full expense of the applicant without reimbursement from
the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as
determined by the Commission, shall be fixed by special
agreement between the City and the applicant. Such cost
shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage
of his land developed and so served.
(c) Road Dedications and Reservations.
(I) New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shan
be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter
half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new
subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may authorize a
new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required street right-of-way width within his own
subdivision boundaries.
(2) Widening and realignment of existing roads. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the Comprehensive Plan,
or Zoning Setback Regulations indicate plans for realignment or
widening a road that would require use of some of the land in the
subdivision, the applicant shan be required to improve and
dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or realignment of
such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved and
dedicated by the applicant at his own expense to the full width as
required by these Subdivision Regula tions. Land reserved for any
road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance whether the land is to be
dedicated to the Municipality fee simple or an easement is
granted to the City.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
134;l.13 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
(a) General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for
approval any plat of subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm
or flood water runoff channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by the Rational Method, or other methods as approved by
the Commission, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with
plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around
any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for
each and every lot and block.
l343.l3 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 82
(b) Nature of Storm Water Facilities.
(1) Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to
carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision.
Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right of way
where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with
the construction standards and specifications.
(2) Accessibility to public storm sewers.
A. Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm water facilities, or if no outlets are within a
reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for
the disposal of stormwaters, subject to the specifications of
the City Engineer. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall
be constructed throughout the subdivisions and be conducted
to an approved outfall. Inspection of facilities shall be
conducted by the City Engineer.
B. If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the
Commission, the developer shall make arrangements for
future storm water disposal by a public utility system at the
time the plat receives final approval. Provisions for such
connection shall be incorporated by inciusion in the
performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
(3) Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage
area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The City Engineer
shall determine the necessary size of the facility, based on the
provisions of the construction standards and specifications
assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
(4) Effect on downstream drainage areas. The City Engineer shall
also study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream
drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be
appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the Commission may withhold
approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the
improvement of such potential condition in such sum as the
Commission determines . No subdivision shall be approved unless
adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage

1343.18 PUBLIC USES.
(a) Parks. Playgrounds and Recreation Areas.
(1) Recreation standards. The Commission shall require that land be
reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreation purposes in
loca tions designa ted on the Comprehensive Plan or otherwise
where such reservations would be appropriate. Each reservation
shall be of suitable size, dimension, topography and general
character and shall have adequate road access, for the particular
purposes envisioned by the Commission. The area shall be shown
and marked on the plat, "Reserved for Park and/or Recreation
Purposes". When recreation areas are required, the Commission
shall determine the number of acres to be reserved on the basis of
providing three acres of recreation area for every 100 dwelling
units. The Commission may refer such proposed reservations to
the City official or department in charge of parks and recreation
for recommendation.
A. The developer shall dedicate all such recreation areas to the
local government as a condition of final subdivision plat
approval.
B. Multi-family and high-density residential. The Planning
Commission shall determine the acreage for reservation
based on the number of dwelling units per acre to occupy
the site as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Minimum size of park and playground reservations. In no case
shall an area of less than two acres be reserved for recreation
purposes if it will be impractical or impossible to secure
additional lands in order to increase its area.
(3) Recreation sites. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be
of a character and location suitable for use as a playground,
playfield or for other recreation purposes, and shall be relatively
level and dry; and shall be improved by the developer to the
standards required by the Commission, which improvements shall
be included in the performance bond.
A recreation site shall have a total frontage on one or more
streets of at least 200 feet, and no other dimension of the site
shall be less than 200 feet in depth. The Commission may refer
a'ny subdivision proposed to contain a dedicated park to the City
official or department in charge of parks and recreation for a
recommendation. All lands to be reserved for dedication to the
City for park purposes shall have prior approval of the City and
shall be shown marked on the plat "Reserved for Park and/or
Recrea tion Purposes".
89 Requirements for Improvements. Reservations and Design 1343.18
(4) Alternative procedure: money in lieu of land. Where, with
respect to a particular subdivision, the reservation of land
required pursuant to this section does not equal the minimum
requirement of this article, the Commission shall require, prior to
final approval of the subdivision plat, that the applicant deposit
with the City a cash payment in lieu of land reservation. Such
deposit shall be placed in a Neighborhood Park and Recreation
Improvement Fund to be established by the City. Such deposit
shall be used by the City for improvement of a neighborhood park,
playground or recreation area including the acquisition of
property. Such deposit shall be used for facilities that will be
actually available to and benefit the persons in such subdivision
and be located in the general neighborhood of the subdivision.
The Commission shall determine the amount to be deposited,
based on the following formula: two hundred dollars ($200.00)
multiplied by the number of times the total area of the
subdivision is divisible by the required minimum lot size of the
zoning district in which it is located, less a credit for the amount
of land actually reserved for recreation purposes, if any, as the
land reserved bears in proportion to the land required for
reservation in subsection (a)(l) hereof, but not including any lands
reserved through densi ty zoning.
(5) Other recreation reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the paragraphs above shall be
construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for
recreation purposes in addition to the requirements of this section.
(b) Other Public Uses.
(1) Plat to provide for public uses. Except when an applicant utilizes
planned unit development in which land is set aside by the
developer as required by the provision of the Zoning Ordinance,
whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a school, recreation
uses (in excess of the requirements of subsection (a)(l) hereof), or
other public use as indicated on the Master Plan or any portion
thereof, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant
into his sketch pIa t. After proper determination of its necessi ty
by the Commission and the appropriate City official or other
public agency involved in the acquisition and use of each such site
and a determination has been made to acquire the site by the
public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the
applicant into the preliminary and final plats.
(2) Referral to public body. The Commission shall refer the sketch
plat to the public body concerned with acquisition for its
consideration and report. The Commission may propose alternate
areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or
agency thirty days for reply. The agency's recommendation, if
affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area
of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required
to complete the acquisi tion.
1343.19 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 90
(3) Notice of property owner. Upon a receipt of an affirmative
report, the Commission shall notify the property owner and shall
designate on the preliminary and final plats that area proposed to
be acquired by the public body.
(4) Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by
a public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within twelve
months of notification, in writing, from the owner that he intends
to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by
a sketch plat of the proposed development and a tentative
schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public agency
to initiate acquisition within the prescribed twelve months shall
result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the
property involved and the freeing of the property for development
in accordance with these Regulations.
(Ord.86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.19 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
(a) General. Existing features which would add value to residential
development or to the local government as a whole, such as trees, as herein defined,
watercourses and falls, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any
subdivision nor any change of grade of the land effected until approval of the
preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall
be preserved, and all trees where required shall be welled and protected against
change of grade. The sketch plat shall show the number and location of existing
trees, as required by these Regulations and shall further indicate all those marked
for retention, and the location of all proposed shade trees required along the street
side of each lot as required by these Regula tions.
(b) Shade Trees Planted by Developer.
(1) As a requirement of subdivision approval, the applicant shall plant
shade trees on the property of the subdivision. Such trees are to
be planted within five feet of the right of way of the road or
roads within and abutting the subdivision, or, at the discretion of
the Commission, wi thin the right of way of such roads. One tree
shall be planted for every forty feet of frontage along each road
unless the Commission, upon recommendation of the City
Engineer, shall grant a waiver. Such waiver shall be granted only
if there are trees growing along such right of way or on the
abutting property which in the opinion of the Commission comply
with these Regulations.
(2) New trees to be provided pursuant to these Regulations shall be
approved by the City Engineer and shall be planted in accordance
with the regulations of the City Engineer. Such trees shall have a
minimum trunk diameter (measured twelve inches above ground
level) of not less than two inches. Only Oak, Honey Locust, Hard
Maples, Ginkgo or other long-lived shade trees, acceptable to the
City Engineer and to the Commission, shall be planted.
91 Requirements for Improvements. Reservations and Design 1343.20
(c) Shade Tree Easement and Dedication. The preliminary plat and final
plat shall reserve an easement authorizing the City to plant shade trees within five
feet of the required right of way of the City. No street shall be accepted for
dedication until the City Engineer shall inform the Commission and the City that
compliance, where necessary, has been made with these Regulations.
(Ord. 86-12. Passed 8-19-86.)
1343.20 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDMSIONS.
(a) General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect to such
land shall make such provision as the Commission may require.
A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of
site plan approval set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Site plan approval and
nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the Commission. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all
the requirements of these Regulations, as well as such additional standards required
by the Commission.
(b) Standards. In addition to the prinCiples and standards in these
Regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant
shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the street, parcel and
block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into
account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be
observed:
(1) Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
(2) Street rights of way and pavement shall be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be
generated thereupon.
(3) Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to
street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
(4) Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to
the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and
storm water drainage.
(5) Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial
subdivision, including the proviSion of extra depth in parcels
backing up on existing or potential residential development and
provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer strip when
necessary.
(6) Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent
existing or potential residential areas.
