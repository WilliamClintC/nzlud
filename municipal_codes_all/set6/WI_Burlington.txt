the same as or similar to conduct prohibited by state statute punishable by fine or

alleged violator into court to determine if restitution shall be ordered under
§ 800.093, Wis. Stats.

shall sign an appropriate statement which accompanies the citation to indicate that he
read the statement required under § 1-5C(1)(g) and shall send the signed statement with

for the elimination of insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations and commercial
buildings and for providing safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations; and the necessity for said
authority is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

continue in existence for the purpose of collecting rent and applying such rent to the
mortgage.
Upon satisfaction of the Housing Authority's mortgage obligation the Housing Authority shall
be terminated.
All other powers, duties and functions set out in § 66.1201, Wis. Stats., for housing
authorities, other than the duties specifically reserved herein for such Housing Authority, are
hereby vested in the Community Development Authority.
Exclusive authority. The Community Development Authority shall have the exclusive power to

and modifications, however, are made to the foregoing § 101.123 that is so adopted by reference, as
allowed under § 101.123(4m) of the Wisconsin Statutes:
The phrase "enclosed place" means a structure or area that is bounded by a floor, a roof, and
three or more substantial walls.
The phrase "substantial wall" is any temporary or permanent wall which:
Does not have any openings to the outside of the structure; or
If there are openings in the wall to the outside of the structure, then the combined surface
area of the said openings in the wall are less than 25% of the total surface area of the wall.
For the purpose of determining the amount of the surface area of openings to the outside of the
structure in a wall:
Only that portion of an opening that permits the free flow of air from the outside of the
structure into the inside of the structure shall be considered an "opening."
Fully or partially closed portions of the windows, doors, or any other type of opening in the
wall shall not be considered an "opening" (i.e., only the unclosed and open portion of any
window, door, or other type of opening shall be considered an "opening").
Openings to the outside in a wall of the structure have both an interior side and an exterior
side. In the event the interior side and the exterior side of the opening are not equal in area,
then the smaller area of the two sides of an opening shall be considered the "opening."
Screens that are a part of a door, window, or any other type of opening, and which are
covered in any manner to prevent the free flow of air through the screen (such as, but not
limited to, attaching a plastic film to the screen) shall not be considered part of the "opening"
in the wall.

to prevent easy access to any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lighted lanterns shall be
kept in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night.
Street repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one day after said
building reaches its destination, report the fact to the Building Inspector, who shall thereupon, in
the company of the Public Works Director, inspect the streets and highways over which said
building has been moved and ascertain their condition. If the removal of said building has caused
any damage to any street or highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith
place them in as good repair as they were before the permit was granted. On the failure of said
permittee to do so within 10 days thereafter to the satisfaction of the governing body, said body
shall repair the damage done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the
sureties on his/her bond responsible for the payment of the same.
Conformance with code. No permit shall be issued to move a building within or into the City and to
establish it upon a location within the City until the Building Inspector has made an investigation of
such building at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from such investigation
that said building is in a sound and stable condition and of such construction that it will meet the
requirements of this Building Code in all respects. A completed plan of all further repairs,
improvements and remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the Building
Inspector, who shall make a finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and
remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of this Building Code and that when the same
are completed the building, as such, will so comply with said Building Code. In the event a building
is to be moved from the municipality to some point outside of the boundaries thereof, the
provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed alterations to
such building may be disregarded.
Bond.
Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way in this municipality, the
party applying therefor shall give a bond to the municipality in a sum to be fixed by the
Building Inspector and which shall not be less than $25,000. Said bond is to be executed by a
corporate surety or two personal sureties to be approved by the governing body or designated
agent conditioned upon, among other things, the indemnification to the City for any costs or
expenses incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons or property
and the payment of any judgment, together with the costs or expenses incurred by the City in
connection therewith, arising out of the removal of the building for which the permit is issued.
Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be a fact that the excavation
exposed by the removal of such building from its foundation shall not be so close to a public
thoroughfare as to permit the accidental falling therein of travelers, or the location, nature and
physical characteristics of the premises and the falling into such excavation by children under
12 years of age is unlikely, the bond required by Subsection F(1) shall be further conditioned
upon the permittee erecting adequate barriers and, within 48 hours, filling in such excavation
or adopting and employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the Building
Inspector and reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences set forth herein.
Insurance. The Building Inspector shall require, in addition to said bond above indicated, public
liability insurance covering injury to one person in the sum of not less than $500,000 and for one
accident in a sum not less than $1,000,000, together with property damage insurance in a sum not
less than $500,000, or such other coverage as deemed necessary.
Review by Plan Commission.
No such permit shall be issued unless it has been found as a fact by the Plan Commission of
the City, by at least a majority vote, after an examination of the application for the permit,
which shall include exterior elevations of the building and accurate photographs of all sides
and views of the same and, in case it is proposed to alter the exterior of said building, plans
and specifications of such proposed alterations, and after a view of the building proposed to

persons, other residents or property owners desiring to be heard, giving such notice of
hearing as it may deem sufficient. Such hearing may be adjourned for a reasonable length of
time, and within 48 hours after the close of the hearing the Plan Commission shall, in writing,
make or refuse to make the finding required by Subsection H(1) hereof and file it in the office
of the Clerk, who shall send a copy of it to the Building Inspector.

§ 119-4. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Burlington,
Wisconsin."
§ 119-5. General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood
or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by
DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed
as A and AO Zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more
than one map or revision is referenced, the most-restrictive information shall apply.
Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH,
AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to
the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in
the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR
and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see Article VIII, Amendments) before they
are effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the
DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Director of Public Works, City of
Burlington. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most-restrictive information shall
apply.

Floodplain map and profile dated April 2015 entitled, "City of Burlington, Dam Break
Analysis, Racine County" approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three
districts as follows:
The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and is contained
within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
The Floodfringe Overlay District (FFO) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the
floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater
during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined,
including A, AH and AO Zones on the FIRM.
Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official Floodplain
Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection D(1) or
(2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Article VIII,
Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to
grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the
basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the
district boundary line shall be settled according to § 119-29C and the criteria in Subsection D(1)
and (2) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a
FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district
boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined
by the map scale.
Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be
grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional
or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is
amended pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.
Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities,
villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary
permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under
§ 62.23, Wis. Stats., for cities; § 61.35, Wis. Stats., for villages; or § 87.30, Wis. Stats., which
relate to floodplains. A more-restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the
extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions,
covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
chapter shall prevail.

Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the
minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation
on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of
the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the
most-recent text amendment to this chapter.
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood-protection standards in this chapter are based on
engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur, or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that
nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages.
This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.
Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.
Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Racine County and Walworth County floodplain zoning
provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the
municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's Official
Zoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of
administering this section and are on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator. All
plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.
Article II. General Standards Applicable to All Floodplain
Districts
§ 119-6. Review of applications and proposals.
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites
will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads;
be constructed with flood-resistant materials; and be constructed to minimize flood damages and
to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals
(including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for
any development that meets the "subdivision" definition of this chapter and all other requirements
in § 119-27B. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and all
public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, are to be located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages.
§ 119-7. Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
No floodplain development shall:
Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or
with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or
Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost.

The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined that the proposed development will
obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted
FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of Article VIII, Amendments, are met.
§ 119-8. Watercourse alterations.
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until
the local official has notified, in writing, all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA
regional offices, and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The
standards of § 119-7 must be met, and the flood-carrying capacity of any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration
or relocation, and pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments, the community shall apply for a letter of
map revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA
and the DNR through the LOMC process.
§ 119-9. Chapter 30, 31, Wis. Stats., development.
Development which requires a permit from the Department, under Chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats., such as
docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary
permits are obtained and amendments to this chapter are made according to Article VIII, Amendments.
§ 119-10. Public or private campgrounds.
Public or private campgrounds shall have a low flood damage potential and shall meet the following
provisions:
The campground is approved by the Department of Health Services.
A land use permit for the campground is issued by the Zoning Administrator.
The character of the river system and the campground elevation are such that a seventy-two-hour
warning of an impending flood can be given to all campground occupants.
There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground that offers the minimum notice
required under this section to all persons in the campground. This procedure shall include a
written agreement between the campground owner, the municipal emergency government
coordinator and the chief law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which
evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations, types of warning
systems to be used and the procedures for notifying at-risk parties, and the methods and
personnel responsible for conducting the evacuation.
This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at which time the agreement shall be
reviewed and updated, by the officials identified in Subsection D, to remain in compliance with all
applicable regulations, including those of the State Department of Health Services and all other
applicable regulations.
Only camping units that are fully licensed, if required, and ready for highway use are allowed.
The camping units shall not occupy any site in the campground for more than 180 consecutive
days, at which time the camping unit must be removed from the floodplain for a minimum of 24
hours.

floodproofed to the flood-protection elevation.
§ 119-11. Flood storage.
No development shall be allowed which removes flood-storage volume unless an equal volume of
storage, as defined by the predevelopment ground surface and the regional flood elevation, shall
be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of
storage which is lost (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not
considered to provide an equal volume of storage.
If compensatory storage cannot be provided, development approval may be obtained upon
receiving plan approval from the Engineer and meeting all other standards in this chapter.

B. The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter may continue, subject to the following conditions:
No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless
they comply with this chapter. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not
limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of
any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Maintenance is not considered
a modification; this includes painting, decorating, paneling and other nonstructural
components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water
supply systems or connections to public utilities. Any costs associated with the repair of a
damaged structure are not considered maintenance. The construction of a deck that does not
exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not
an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of
the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure.
If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12
consecutive months, it is no longer permitted; and any future use of the property, and any
structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter.
The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming
structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions
which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those
modifications represent.
No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure, or any structure with a
nonconforming use, which, over the life of the structure, would equal or exceed 50% of its
present equalized assessed value shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently
changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and
commercial uses in compliance with § 119-18C. The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a
nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood-protection
elevation are excluded from the 50% provisions of this subsection.
No maintenance to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use,
the cost of which would equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall
be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with
a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with
§ 119-18C.
If, on a per-event basis, the total value of the work being done under Subsection B(4) and (5)
equals or exceeds 50% of the present equalized assessed value, the work shall not be
permitted unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a
conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with
§ 119-18C.
Except as provided in Subsection B(8), if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced,
reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance
requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the
structure to its predamaged condition equals or exceeds 50% of the structure's present
equalized assessed value.
For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or destroyed by a nonflood
disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building shall be permitted in
order to restore it to the size and use in effect prior to the damage event, provided that the

Hydraulic modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in
Ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional
Flood Elevation, and the following:
Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic model shall be based on
detailed study information for downstream structures (dam, bridge, culvert) to
determine adequate starting WSEL for the study.
Channel sections must be surveyed.
Minimum four-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the
development of cross-section overbank and floodplain mapping.
A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in
developed areas, with additional intermediate cross sections required at
transitions in channel bottom slope, including a survey of the channel at each
location.
The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used.
A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each
structure.
Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of
the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on
the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet.
Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning
parameters for the base model, such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion
and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be
calibrated to past flooding data, such as high-water marks, to determine the
reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate
justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted
engineering practices.
The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing
and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The
height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study
profiles shall be no more than 0 feet.
Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all crosssection
locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographic
data, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposed
development is located in the floodway.
If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it is
determined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation.
If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be added to
the base model to show the difference between existing and proposed
conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the same as in the
existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard accepted
engineering practices is provided.
Zone AE floodplains.
Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing study, the appropriate
method to be used shall be based on Ch. NR 116.07(3), Wis. Admin. Code,
Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge.

Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in Ch.
NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional
Flood Elevation, and the following:
Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure
correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised
data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the
revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be
generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the
Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.
Corrected effective model. The corrected effective model shall not include any
man-made physical changes since the effective model date but shall import the
model into the most-current version of HEC-RAS for Department review.
Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing model shall be required to
support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the
revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to
base the revised (post-project) model.
Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised (post-project conditions)
model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the
topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect
proposed conditions.
All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be
supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans
and survey notes.
Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which
the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of
the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in
water surface elevations and topwidths computed by the revised models

Include the reasons for granting an appeal, describing the hardship demonstrated by the
applicant in the case of a variance, clearly stated in the recorded minutes of the Board
proceedings.
Boundary disputes. The following procedure shall be used by the Board in hearing disputes
concerning floodplain district boundaries:
If a floodplain district boundary is established by approximate or detailed floodplain studies,
the flood elevations or profiles shall prevail in locating the boundary. If none exist, other
evidence may be examined.
The person contesting the boundary location shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present arguments and technical evidence to the Board.
If the boundary is incorrectly mapped, the Board should inform the Zoning Committee or the
person contesting the boundary location to petition the governing body for a map amendment
according to Article VIII, Amendments.
Variances.
The Board may, upon appeal, grant a variance from the standards of this chapter if an
applicant convincingly demonstrates that:
Literal enforcement of this chapter will cause unnecessary hardship;
The hardship is due to adoption of the Floodplain Ordinance and unique property
conditions not common to adjacent lots or premises. In such case, the chapter or map
must be amended;
The variance is not contrary to the public interest; and
The variance is consistent with the purpose of this chapter in § 119-3.
In addition to the criteria in Subsection D(1), to qualify for a variance under FEMA regulations,
the following criteria must be met:
The variance shall not cause any increase in the regional flood elevation;
Variances can only be granted for lots that are less than 1/2 acre and are contiguous to
existing structures constructed below the RFE; and
Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, shall be
the minimum relief necessary, shall not cause increased risks to public safety or
nuisances, shall not increase costs for rescue and relief efforts and shall not be contrary
to the purpose of this chapter.
A variance shall not:
Grant, extend or increase any use prohibited in the zoning district;
Be granted for a hardship based solely on an economic gain or loss;
Be granted for a hardship which is self-created;
Damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area;
Allow actions without the amendments to this chapter or map(s) required in Article VIII,
Amendments; and

may increase risks to life and property and flood insurance premiums could increase up to
$25 per $100 of coverage. A copy shall be maintained with the variance record.
§ 119-30. Review of appeals of permit denials.
The zoning agency (§ 119-28) or Board shall review all data related to the appeal. This may
include:
Permit application data listed in § 119-27B;

Data listed in § 119-14A(2) where the applicant has not submitted this information to the
Zoning Administrator; and
Other data submitted with the application or submitted to the Board with the appeal.
For appeals of all denied permits, the Board shall:
Follow the procedures of § 119-29;
Consider zoning agency recommendations; and
Either uphold the denial or grant the appeal.
For appeals concerning increases in regional flood elevation, the Board shall:
Uphold the denial where the Board agrees with the data showing an increase in flood
elevation. Increases may only be allowed after amending the flood profile and map and all
appropriate legal arrangements are made with all adversely affected property owners as per
the requirements of Article VIII, Amendments; and
Grant the appeal where the Board agrees that the data properly demonstrates that the project
does not cause an increase, provided that no other reasons for denial exist.
§ 119-31. Floodproofing standards for noncomforming structures
or uses.
No permit or variance shall be issued for a nonresidential structure designed to be watertight
below the regional flood elevation until the applicant submits a plan certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures will protect the structure or
development to the flood-protection elevation and submits a FEMA floodproofing certificate.
For a structure designed to allow the entry of floodwaters, no permit or variance shall be issued
until the applicant submits a plan either:
Certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
That meets or exceeds the following standards:

MUNICIPALITY or MUNICIPAL
The county, city or village governmental units enacting, administering and enforcing this chapter.
NAVD or NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM
Elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1988 adjustment.
NEW CONSTRUCTION
For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by
this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose
of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever
is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NGVD or NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM
Elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment.
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE
An existing, lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural
requirements of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an
existing residential structure in the Floodfringe District is a conforming use. However, if the lowest
floor is lower than the flood-protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.)
NONCONFORMING USE
An existing, lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies (such as a residence
in the floodway).
OBSTRUCTION TO FLOW
Any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development, alone
or together with any future development, will cause an increase in regional flood height.
OFFICIAL FLOODPLAIN ZONING MAP
That Map, adopted and made part of this chapter, as described in § 119-5B, which has been
approved by the Department and FEMA.
OPEN SPACE USE
Those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures.
ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK
The point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so
continuous as to leave a distinctive mark, such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of
terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristic.
PERSON
An individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or state
agency.
PRIVATE SEWAGE SYSTEM

absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage
system approved by the Department of Commerce, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil
absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure, or a system located on
a different parcel than the structure.
PUBLIC UTILITIES
9/15/2020 City of Burlington, WI Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/BU1954?guid=BU1954&children=true 140/675
Those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines, such as electric, telephone and
telegraph, and distribution and collection systems, such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer.
REASONABLY SAFE FROM FLOODING
Base floodwaters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the
floodplain, and any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or
proposed buildings.
REGIONAL FLOOD
A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A
"regional flood" is a flood with a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year; and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
START OF CONSTRUCTION
The date the building permit was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns,
or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling,
nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the "actual start of construction"
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE
Any man-made object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to,
placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including but not limited to roofed and
walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
SUBDIVISION
Has the meaning given in § 236.02(12), Wis. Stats.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the equalized assessed value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs
are considered substantial improvement, regardless of the work performed. The term does not,
however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing
health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building Official and that are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of an historic structure,
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic
structure.
UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP
Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made
strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density
unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this chapter.
VARIANCE

Editor’s Note: This ordinance also repealed former Ch. 148, Construction Site Erosion, adopted 7-20-
2010 by Or.d No. 1903(6).
§ 148-1. Legislative authority.
This chapter is adopted under the authority granted by § 62.234, Wis. Stats. This chapter
supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under § 62.23, Wis. Stats., that
relate to construction site erosion control. Except as otherwise specified in § 62.234, Wis. Stats.
§ 62.23, Wis. Stats., applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter.
The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the
same governing body.
The Common Council hereby designates the City Engineer to administer and enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
The requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent erosion and sediment control
requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals
including those authorized under § 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
§ 148-2. Findings of fact.
The Common Council finds that runoff from land-disturbing construction activity carries a significant

§ 148-3. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and
control water pollution; prevent and control soil erosion; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic
life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic
beauty; and promote sound economic growth, by minimizing the amount of sediment and other
pollutants carried by runoff or discharged from land-disturbing construction activity to waters of the
state in the City of Burlington.
§ 148-4. Applicability; jurisdiction; exclusions.
Applicability.
This chapter applies to the following land-disturbing construction activities except as provided
under Subsection A(2).
A construction site on which one or more land disturbing construction activities occurs,
including areas that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale where
multiple separate and distinct land disturbing construction activities may be taking place
at different times on different schedules but under one plan. A long-range planning
document that describes separate construction projects, such as a twenty-year
transportation improvement plan, is not a common plan of development.
Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in Subsection A(1)(a), this chapter applies
to construction sites of any size that, in the opinion of the City Engineer, are likely to
result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or
receiving body of water, that causes undue channel erosion, that increases water
pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property
or public safety.
This chapter does not apply to the following:
Transportation facilities, except transportation facility construction projects that are part of
a larger common plan of development such as local roads within a residential or
industrial development.
A construction project that is exempted by federal statutes or regulations from the
requirement to have a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit issued
under Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 122, for land-disturbing construction
activity.

Commerce Commission, or as applying to the military forces of the United States.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply equally to new structures, including additions, and to
change of use, change of occupancy, change of occupants, renovations of, alterations of,

This chapter shall not be construed to affect the responsibility of any persons owning, operating, or
installing equipment for injury to persons or damage to property caused by any defect therein, nor shall
the municipality, or any person, firm, company or agent(s) for the municipality, be held as assuming
such liability by reason of any plan, system, submittal review and/or conditional approval, inspection or
reinspection authorized herein or the permit issued herein provided or by reason of the disapproval or
approval of any equipment and/or system authorized herein.
§ 155-16. Service of correction orders.
The service of correction orders may be made upon the owner, occupant or both or any other
person responsible for the conditions that violate any section of this chapter. A copy of the service
order can be delivered personally to the owner or by leaving it with the person in charge of the
premises. Whenever it may be necessary to serve such order upon the owner of the premises,
such an order may be served either by delivering to and leaving with the person a copy of the
order, or if such owner is absent from the jurisdiction of the AHJ making the order, by mailing such
a copy to the owner's last known post office address. Any such order may be given verbally,
handwritten on an approved inspection form or typed and delivered to such occupant personally or
by placing such order in a conspicuous place on the door to the entrance of the premises.
Compliance with service of correction orders that include conditions that are hazardous to life or
safety of the occupants shall require immediate correction. All other violations shall be corrected
within a specified time or date, as the AHJ shall determine.
When the owner of any property or person in apparent control of the property is issued an order by
the AHJ and fails to comply with the order, the municipality may do the work ordered or cause the

If technical expertise is unavailable within the municipality because of new technology, processes,
products, facilities, materials, design, operation or use of a building or premises subject to the
inspection of the municipality, the AHJ may require the owner or the person in possession or
control of the building or premises to provide, without charge to the municipality, a technical
opinion and report. The opinion and report shall be prepared by a qualified engineer, specialist,
laboratory or fire safety organization, acceptable to the AHJ and the owner, and shall analyze the
fire safety properties of the design, operation or use of the building or premises and the facilities
and appurtenances situated thereon, and prescribe all necessary recommended changes. The
Fire Department may also acquire technical assistance from a consultant and may charge a fee to
the owner or occupant for the service provided.
§ 155-18. Revocation and/or expiration of permits.
The AHJ may revoke any permit issued in accordance with this chapter in any case where the
AHJ may find that any of the conditions for the issuance have not been maintained or where there
has been false statement or misrepresentation of any material fact in the application or plans on
which the issuance was based.
The AHJ shall promptly notify the permit holder of the request for revocation and, if so requested
by the permit holder, the effective date of the revocation shall be deferred pending a hearing
before the Chief of the Fire Department. The decision of the Chief for revocation, following the
hearing, shall be final.

§ 155-20. Investigation of fires; police powers.
The Fire Department shall investigate the cause and origin, and circumstances, of fires occurring
within their jurisdiction to determine if the fire was caused by carelessness or design. Such
investigations may begin immediately upon the occurrence of such a fire, and if it appears to the
officer making such an investigation that such fire is of suspicious origin and of a significant
nature, the Fire Chief shall be notified of the facts. The AHJ shall notify the proper authorities
designated by law to pursue the investigation of such matters and shall further cooperate with the
authorities in the collection of evidence and in the prosecution of the case. A member of the fire
investigation team shall file a written report of damage associated with every fire in a timely
manner. It shall contain a statement of all facts relating to the cause and origin and circumstances
of such fire and other information as may be required.
The Municipal Attorney and any other department of the municipality, upon the request of the Fire
Chief, shall assist in the investigation of any fire that, in the Chief's opinion, is of suspicious origin.
Any officer of the Fire Department may cause the arrest of any person failing to give the right-ofway
to the Fire Department in responding to or investigating an incident.
The Fire Chief or officers in command may prescribe certain limits in the vicinity of any incident
within which no persons, excepting firefighters and police officers and those admitted by order of
any officer of the Fire Department, shall be permitted to enter.
The Fire Chief or officers in command shall have the power to cause the removal of any property
whenever it is deemed necessary and prudent for the preservation of such property. During the
progress of any fire, they shall have the power to cause the removal of all wires or other facilities
and the turning off of all electricity or other services where the same impedes work of the Fire
Department during the progress of fire.
It shall be lawful for any Fire Department personnel, while acting under the direction of the Fire
Chief or officer in command, to enter premises adjacent to or in the vicinity of a building or other
property that is on fire for the purpose of extinguishing, containing, or searching for extension of
such fire or other exigent circumstances.
During the progress of fire, the Fire Chief or officers in command shall have the power to order the
removal or destruction of any property necessary to prevent the further spread of fire or to ensure
that the fire has not extended to other areas, providing that it is likely that, unless such property is
removed, other property is in danger of being destroyed by fire.
No person shall hinder, resist or obstruct any firefighter in the discharge of his duties as provided
in this section. The person so offending shall be deemed guilty of resisting firefighters in the
discharge of their duties.
§ 155-21. Automatic fire sprinkler, fire control and/or fire
suppression system protection.
Intent. The intent of this section is to require the installation of automatic fire sprinkler, fire control
and/or fire suppression systems to improve the protection of life and property within the
municipality. It will establish a minimum standard for fire safety through the standardization of the
design, installation, testing and maintenance requirements for automatic fire sprinkler suppression.
Code compliance. All automatic fire sprinkler fire control and/or fire suppression systems installed,
modified, altered and/or repaired shall comply with this chapter and all of the applicable NFPA
codes and/or standards.

Chapter 170. Graffiti
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Common Council of the City of Burlington 6-6-1995 by Ord. No. 1499(4).
Amendments noted where applicable.]

Nuisances — See Ch. 227.
Parks and public areas — See Ch. 234.
Peace and good order — See Ch. 238.
§ 170-1. Purpose; findings.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a program for removal of graffiti from walls and structures
on both public and private property and to provide regulations designed to prevent and control the
further spread of graffiti in the City of Burlington.
The occurrence of graffiti on both public and private buildings, structures and property creates a
condition of blight within the City which results in a deterioration of property and business values
for adjacent and surrounding properties. Such markings are often placed on said structures by
gangs to indicate ownership or control over a certain area for criminal or other purposes and
encourage gang violence which is detrimental to the public health, safety and well-being of
persons residing in the City.
The Common Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance which
must be abated so as to avoid the detrimental impact of such graffiti upon the City and to prevent
its further spread. While property is a victim of the graffiti, where the responsible party fails to
correct the defacing graffiti, it is always the duty of the property owner to remove graffiti as soon as
reasonably possible.
§ 170-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
GRAFFITI
The unauthorized writing, marking, spraying or other application of paint, ink, chalk, dye or other
similar substance or scratching or otherwise affixing inscribed materials on public and private
buildings, structures and places.

No person shall apply graffiti on publicly or privately owned structures located on publicly or privately
owned real property within the City.
§ 170-4. Removal of graffiti.
Any person applying graffiti within the City shall have the duty to remove the same within 24 hours
after notice by the City or the public or private owner of the property involved. Failure of any person to
remove graffiti shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter. Where graffiti is applied by
juveniles, the parent or parents shall be responsible for such removal or the payment therefor.
§ 170-5. Notice to property owner; removal at owner's expense.
Whenever the Chief of Police or his/her designated representative is apprised of the presence of
graffiti located on privately owned real estate within the City, the Chief of Police or his/her
designated representative may cause a written notice to be served upon the owner of the affected
premises, as such owner's name and address appear on the last assessment roll for the City, by
certified mail (with return receipt). "Owner," as used herein, means any person in possession and
also any person having or claiming to have any legal or equitable interest in said premises as
described by a preliminary title search from any accredited title company. The failure of any
person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding hereunder.
The property owner shall have 10 days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or be
subject to City removal of the graffiti and assessment of the costs of such removal against the real
estate as a special charge.
Form of notice to remove graffiti. The notice shall be substantially in the following form:
NOTICE OF INTENT TO REMOVE GRAFFITI
Date:
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required at your expense to remove or paint over the
graffiti located on the property commonly known as _________________ Burlington, WI, which
is visible to public view, within 10 days after the date of this notice or, if you fail to do so, then
City employees or private City contractors will enter upon your property and abate the public
nuisance by removal or painting over of the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the City
employees or its private contractors will be assessed against your property as a special charge.
All persons having any objection to, or interest in, said matters are hereby notified to submit any
objections or comments to the Chief of Police for the City or his/her designated representative
within 10 days from the date of this notice. At the conclusion of this ten-day period the City may
proceed with the abatement of the graffiti inscribed on your property at your expense without
further notice.
Service of notice. The service of this notice shall be made on the day the notice is dated and by
affidavit filed with the City Clerk. A like notice shall also be posted at a conspicuous place on the
premises upon which the graffiti is inscribed. The posting of this notice shall be made on the day
the notice is dated.
Physical removal of graffiti. If the owner fails to remove or cause the graffiti to be removed by the
designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the Chief of Police or his/her designated
representative approves, the Chief of Police or his/her designated representative shall so notify
the City Administrator and the City Administrator shall cause the graffiti to be abated by City forces
or private contract, and the City or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the
premises for such purpose.

§ 170-6. Removal at City expense.
Whenever the Chief of Police or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti is so located

as to be capable of being viewed by persons utilizing any public right-of-way or walkway open to the
public in this City, the Chief of Police or his/her designated representative is authorized, upon Common
Council approval, to provide for the removal of the graffiti solely at the City's expense, without
reimbursement from the property owner upon whose property the graffiti has been applied, upon the
following conditions:
In removing the graffiti the painting or repair of a more extensive area shall not be authorized.
Where a structure is owned by a public entity other than this City, the removal of the graffiti may be
authorized only after securing the consent of the public entity having jurisdiction over the structure.
Where a structure is privately owned, the removal of the graffiti by City forces or by a private
contractor under the direction of the City may be authorized only after securing the consent of the
owner.

purposes of consumption.
TAG
Any tamper-proof tag, seal, sticker, or device approved by the City of Burlington which is
designed to be affixed to a keg and which displays a registration number and such other
information as may be required by the City.
Purpose. The identification of purchasers/providers of kegs of fermented malt beverages for
consumption by underage persons is a major law enforcement concern in the City of
Burlington. When kegs are found where underage persons are present, it is necessary to
readily identify those responsible. The investigation of offenses involving the furnishing of
alcohol to minors and related offenses involving kegs is inhibited by the inability to identify
who purchased the keg. Registration/identification information must be available on all kegs
sold in the City. Individual identification number, purchaser and retail seller identity information
will better enable law enforcement to identify providers of kegs to underage persons.
Therefore, it is in the public interest to require reasonable keg registration/identification
provisions as hereinafter set forth. This subsection provides for the registration and
documentation of retail sales of kegs in the City.
Registration procedure. No retail licensee of fermented malt beverages may sell fermented
malt beverages in a keg for off-site consumption (at a location which does not hold a
fermented malt beverage license) without having registered the sale on a registration log
containing the information and declaration required in Subsection F(3)(a), and having tagged
the keg as required under Subsection F(3)(b).
The following shall be required for completion of the registration log:
Purchasers shall provide a current government-issued photo identification with the
purchaser's name, address and individual identification number to the seller, who
shall view the identification and then record and document the purchaser's name
and address in a log. The log shall also contain the individual keg tag identification
assigned to the keg by the seller and include the date of sale and indicate that the
photo identification that was produced was matched to the purchaser. The log shall
also contain the identity of each person, owner or employee who sold each keg to
each purchaser.
The purchaser shall sign a statement on the registration log containing the following
declaration:
The purchaser is of legal age to purchase, possess and consume fermented
malt beverages.
The purchaser will not allow any person under the age of 21 years, unless
authorized by state law, to consume the beverage.
The purchaser will not remove, obliterate, or allow to be removed or obliterated,
the tag required under this subsection to be affixed to the container.
Sellers shall assign, record and attach to each retail keg sold for off-site consumption an
individual keg tag at or before the time of sale to the purchaser.
Sellers of kegs shall obtain the individual keg tags from the Police Department, which
shall record to whom the consecutively numbered tags are distributed and shall restrict
the distribution of the tamper-proof tags to licensed alcoholic beverage retailers. The
Police Department shall keep the record of distribution for one year.
Keg return procedure. Sellers shall record the return of the keg on the registration log and
shall remove the individual keg identification tamper-proof tags from the kegs when they are
returned.

Sellers' registration logs. Sellers' registration logs shall be kept by the seller, at the place of
business, for a minimum period of six months from the date of sale. If the seller goes out of
business, registration logs less than six months old shall be delivered to the Police
Department. Sellers shall provide keg registration logs to the Burlington Police Department
upon request.
This subsection does not apply to keg sales to fermented malt beverage licensees.
Keg possession requirements and restrictions. No person shall possess a keg after the
effective date of this subsection without an intact and legible keg tag attached (except for
retail sellers of kegs and fermented malt beverage licensees).
Penalty for violation; seizure of keg; affirmative defense.
A seller or purchaser or other person who violates any of the above requirements and/or
restrictions imposed by this subsection shall be subject to a forfeiture not to exceed $ 500
per violation, plus all applicable costs.
Any untagged keg found in violation of Subsection F(7) is subject to seizure by the
Burlington Police Department.
Proof of acquisition of any untagged keg from a seller located in a jurisdiction not subject
to any keg-tagging ordinance or regulation, in a manner where such acquisition was legal
at the time of acquisition, shall be an affirmative defense to a prosecution for violation of
Subsection F(7).
Editor's Note: This ordinance reaffirmed Ord. No. 1846(19) and removed the sunset date that had
been set forth in that ordinance.
§ 187-14. Closing hours.
No premises for which an alcohol beverage license has been issued shall remain open for the sale of
alcohol beverages:
If a wholesale license, between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., except on Saturday when the closing
hour shall be 9:00 p.m.

§ 204-1. Loitering or prowling prohibited.
No person shall loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals

circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact

manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other
circumstances make it impracticable, a police or peace officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense
under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be
warranted by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall

believed by the police or peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.

Summary abatement.
Order of abatement. If the inspecting officer determines that a public nuisance exists within
the City and that there is imminent danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or
decency, the officer may, without notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of a
public nuisance constituting imminent danger to the public and requiring immediate action be
taken as the officer deems necessary to abate the nuisance. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter, the order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such
order is directed shall comply with the order immediately.
Abatement by City. Whenever the owner or occupant shall refuse or neglect to remove or
abate the condition described in the order, the inspecting officer shall, in his discretion, enter
upon the premises and cause the nuisance to be removed or abated and the City shall
recover the expenses incurred thereby from the owner or occupant of the premises or from
the person who has caused, permitted or maintained the nuisance.
Nonsummary abatement.
Order to abate nuisance. If the inspecting officer determines that a public nuisance exists on
private premises but that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to threaten imminent
danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, he shall issue an order reciting
the existence of a public nuisance and requiring the owner or occupant of the premises to
remove or abate the condition described in the order within the time period specified therein.
The order shall be served personally on the owner of the premises, as well as the occupant if
different from the owner and applicable to the described nuisance, or, at the option of the
inspecting officer, the notice may be mailed to the last known address of the person, to be
served by registered mail with return receipt. If the owner or the occupant cannot be served in
person or by registered mail, the order may be served by posting it on the main entrance of
the premises and by publishing it as a Class 3 notice under Wis. Stat. ch. 985. The time limit
specified in the order runs from the date of service or publication, and shall be not less than
30 days.
Abatement by City. If the owner or occupant fails or refuses to comply within the time period
prescribed, the inspecting officer shall enter upon the premises and cause the nuisance to be
removed or abated and the City shall recover the expenses incurred thereby from the owner
or occupant of the premises or from the person who has caused or permitted the nuisance.
Remedy from order. Any person affected by such order shall, within 30 days of service or
publication of the order, apply to the Circuit Court for an order restraining the City and the
inspecting officer from entering on the premises and abating or removing the nuisance, or be
forever barred. The court shall determine the reasonableness of the order for abatement of
the nuisance.
Other methods not excluded. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the
abatement of public nuisances by the City or its officials in accordance with the laws of the state.
Court order. Except when necessary under Subsection B, an officer hereunder shall not use force
to obtain access to private property to abate a public nuisance but shall request permission to
enter upon private property if such premises are occupied and, if such permission is denied, shall
apply to any court having jurisdiction for an order assisting the abatement of the public nuisance.
§ 227-8. Cost of abatement.
In addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter for the erection, contrivance, creation,
continuance or maintenance of a public nuisance, the cost of abating a public nuisance by the City
shall be collected as a debt from the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the

Burlington park within the City limits for over 24 hours, it shall have been deemed to have
been abandoned by the owner.
Abandonment prohibited. No person shall abandon any boat or other watercraft or leave any
such boat or watercraft within the confines of any City of Burlington park for such time or

Chapter 240
§ 240-1. Purpose and Intent.
The City finds and declares that child sex offenders (as hereinafter defined) are a serious threat to
public safety. Given the high rate of recidivism, reducing opportunity and temptation is important to
minimizing the risk of re-offense, and there is a need to protect children where they congregate or
play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and daycare
centers. The City finds and declares that, in addition to schools and daycare centers, children
congregate or play in a number of public places, including parks and other facilities.
This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the
City of Burlington from the risk that child sex offenders may re-offend where children congregate. It
is the intent of this chapter to serve the City's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City by creating child safety zones as areas
where children regularly congregate, and that restrict child sex offenders' residing in, entering, or
loitering in child safety zones.

land, however, the child sex offender shall not otherwise loiter in or within 300 feet of the said
child safety zone.
A child sex offender does not violate this provision if any of the following apply:
The child safety zone supports a church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or other house of
religious worship and entry and presence in the child safety zone occurs for the limited
and sole purpose of attending or visiting the said religious facility. In such event, however,
the child sex offender may not enter into and/or loiter in or around any other area of the
child safety zone in which the said religious facility is located. This shall expressly
include, but not be limited to, any children's school and/or children's playground located
in the child safety zone.
The child safety zone supports a use lawfully attended by the child sex offender's natural
or adopted child or ward, and which child or ward's use or attendance reasonably
requires the attendance of the child sex offender as parent or guardian; further provided
the child sex offender must provide written notice to and obtain written approval from the
person in charge of the facility in the child safety zone to attend the event with his child or
ward and the written approval must be specific as to days, dates, and times when the
event will be conducted;
The child safety zone supports a polling location in a local, state, or federal election;
further provided, the child sex offender must be eligible to vote in the election, the child

public, or a health care or professional service facility in addition to the use which creates
a child safety zone; further provided the child sex offender:

business use, or the health care or professional service facility on the property; and

It is not a violation of this provision if the child sex offender is present in or upon a child
safety zone for purposes of exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, including the freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, and the
right of assembly, and/or as otherwise permitted by this chapter.
Holiday prohibition. No child sex offender may participate in any holiday event involving children
such as distributing candy or other items as part of a Halloween event, wearing a Santa Claus or
other costume as part of a Christmas holiday event, or wearing an Easter Bunny or other costume
as part of an Easter holiday event. This present holiday prohibition shall not apply, however, to
holiday events in which the child sex offender is the parent or guardian of one or more children
involved, and there are no nonfamilial children present, and/or the event is sponsored by or held at
a religious facility as defined and described in above Subsection B(4)(a).
Enforcement and duty to inquire. Unless flight by the child sex offender or other circumstances
make it impractical, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for a violation of § 240-3B,
afford the child sex offender an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be
warranted, by requesting the child sex offender to identify himself or herself and explain his or her
presence and/or conduct in the child safety zone. No person shall be convicted of an offense
under this provision if the law enforcement officer did not make a good faith effort to comply with
the preceding sentence, or if at trial, the explanation given by the child sex offender is true, and if it
had been believed by the law enforcement officer, would have reasonably dispelled alarm.
§ 240-4. Violations and penalties.
If a child sex offender violates the provisions of this chapter, such offender shall be subject to the
general penalty provisions set forth under Chapter 1, § 1-4 of this Municipal Code (and/or as the same
may be amended or renumbered in the future). Each day a violation continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition, the City may undertake all other legal and equitable remedies available
(including, but not limited to, obtaining injunctive relief and/or a restraining order against a child sex
offender).
§ 240-5. Severability.
If any provision of this chapter is found invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality
shall not affect the other provisions of this chapter.

abides by all other parking restrictions.
All mobile food vehicle units must maintain a distance of 10 feet from the nearest edge of any
building, vehicle and combustible materials and two feet from the curbs. All vendors will

or upon approval by the Common Council. Mobile food vendors are allowed adjacent to or
within City parks with Park Board approval, but shall not park, stop, or operate a mobile food

A valid food establishment permit issued by the State of Wisconsin or any other competent
health department for any mobile restaurant or mobile retail food establishment which

food vehicle removed by the time specified. Mobile food vehicle vending hours are not
restricted on private property locations.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to supersede or repeal any ordinance relating to
noise, park closing hours, or parking, except as specifically provided in this chapter. Vendors
will take every precaution to ensure that their operations do not materially affect the peace
and welfare of the general public nor cause any unreasonably loud, disturbing and
unnecessary noise or any noise of such character, intensity or duration as to be detrimental to
the life or health of any individual or which is in the disturbance of public peace and welfare,
and/or which creates a nuisance.
Specified locations of operation.
Mobile food vendor parking in designated City-owned or -controlled property will be allowed to
be operated on a first-come-first-served basis within designated vending locations as

service does become available.
Notification to connect. If a building is subject to the connection requirement of Subsection
A(1), the City shall serve on the owner of the building, personally or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, a written notice of the need for the owner to connect the building, or cause
the building to be connected, to the system. The notification shall specify the amount of any
charge or fee to be paid by the owner, including the connection fee as required by § 259-5,
and, if necessary, the type, size, and method of connection with the public sewer to ensure a
properly designed and constructed connection.
Payment of fees. Within 180 days after receipt of the notice, the owner shall pay all applicable
charges, including the connection fee, and cause the connection to be made at his own
expense in conformity with the requirements prescribed by §§ 259-3C and D and 259-4C to
E. If the charges and fees are not paid within 180 days after receipt of notice, such charges
shall be assessed as a special tax lien against the property. If the owner is unable to pay the
applicable charges and fees in one sum, the owner may request that these costs be paid in a
maximum of five equal annual installments with an interest rate to be established by the City's
Common Council, but not more than 10% per annum, with the unpaid balance to be a special
tax lien against the property, pursuant to § 281.45, Wis. Stats.
Owner's failure to connect.

served by the City's sewerage system is to be vacated, or whenever an owner desires to
discontinue sewer service, the owner shall notify the City in writing. The owner of the building or
point source shall be liable for any loss or damage to the property of the City's system directly or
indirectly caused by or resulting from the vacation or discontinuance. The owner, however, shall
not be responsible for any damages if caused directly through the fault of the system or any City
employee or agent.
§ 259-5. Connection fees.
Establishment of fees. A connection fee shall be collected by the City from all new connections to
the sewerage system or existing wastewater connections which have a change in operations or
activity resulting in the utilization of additional sewerage system capacity. The imposition of
connection fees is intended to ensure that sewerage system capital costs are fairly apportioned
between current and future users.
Amount of fee. The connection fees shall be based upon the user's potential needed capacity, in
terms of residential equivalent units (REUs), in the sewerage system. The schedule of connection
fees shall be as set forth below.
Schedule of connection fees.
Connection fee per residential equivalent unit (REU).

All connections except those in extraterritorial sanitary districts: an amount per REU as
set by the Common Council.[1]
Editor's Note: See Fee Schedule on file at the City Clerk's office.
Connection fees for users in extraterritorial sanitary districts shall be as set forth in the
applicable intermunicipal agreement.
Residential equivalent unit for residential development will be assigned as follows:
Single-family residence: one REU.
Multifamily dwellings (duplex, apartments or condominiums):
Each unit with three or more bedrooms: one REU.
Each unit with two bedrooms: 0.75 REU.
Each unit with one bedroom or less: 0.5 REU.
Nonresidential development fees for nonresidential properties will be determined as follows:
The property owner shall submit on waste disposal questionnaire forms provided by the
City a good faith estimation of the intended water and sewer usage for any nonresidential
development. A copy of the waste disposal questionnaire is included in Appendix D of
this chapter.[2]
Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file at the City Clerk's office.
Based on the information supplied by the property owner, the City shall estimate the
annual projected wastewater flow and calculate the number of residential equivalent units
for that property. The number of REUs shall be determined by dividing the estimated
wastewater flow by the annual flow of the average residential user. The minimum REU
for any account shall not be less than 1.00 REU. Upon completion of the REU
computations, all REUs will be rounded up to the nearest 0.50 REU.
Based upon the number of REUs calculated in Subsection C(3)(b), the City shall
calculate and impose an interim sewer connection fee under the schedule set forth in
Subsection C(1).
Since the charge determined under Subsection C(3)(a) and (b) above is based upon
estimated usage, the City shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon
actual usage for a twelve-month period. At any time after initial connection to the system
and establishment of a nonresidential account, the City may review the account history to
determine the highest actual recorded usage in a twelve-month period.
Based upon the information obtained under Subsection C(3)(d), the City shall recalculate
the number of residential equivalent units and may recalculate the charge pursuant to
Subsection C(3)(c), provided that the recalculated REU estimate exceeds the current one
by at least one REU. If the recalculated charge exceeds the original charge, the
difference between the recalculated charge and the amount paid for the original charge
shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made. There will be no
refund notwithstanding the result of the recalculation.
Connected properties. Each existing property connected to the sewerage system that has a
change in operations or activity which results in the utilization of additional sewerage system
capacity will be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, to determine the imposition of a
connection fee. The charge shall be based upon the estimated annual usage for the sewer
customer operating on the premises reduced by a credit for sewer system capital charges
paid through prior connection fees or sewer user charges. The following methodology shall be

incorporated into a determination of connection fees for existing properties previously
connected to the sewerage system where a change in operations or activity takes place:
An estimate shall be made of projected future annual usage, in terms of REUs, for the
customers utilizing the subject property.
The City shall determine if a previous connection fee has been imposed upon the subject
property. If a prior connection fee has been paid, the number of REUs determined in
Subsection C(4)(a) shall be reduced by the total number of REUs on which the previous
charge was based. The net number of incremental REUs shall be the basis for the
connection fee computation.
If the property was developed prior to the inception of the connection fee and no
connection fee was paid for the property, then a credit shall be given for the estimated
sewer system capital charges previously paid. The estimated contribution toward system
capital cost shall be based upon historical sewer usage. The most recent two-year period
for which the property had operating activity shall serve as the basis for the credit. The
average annual usage in terms of REUs shall be deducted from the number of REUs
computed according to Subsection C(4)(a) to yield the net number of incremental REUs
subject to the connection fee.
If the net incremental REUs calculated in Subsection C(4)(c) are greater than or equal to
two REUs, they shall be multiplied by the charge in Subsection C(1)(a) to determine the
connection fee. If the net incremental REUs are less than two REUs, no additional
connection fee will be charged.
Administration. The Building Inspector shall be responsible for the administration and collection of
the connection fee. This fee shall be paid directly to the Building Inspector at the time application
is made to him for a building permit or, if no building permit is needed, at the time an application is
filed for a permit to connect into the City's wastewater collection system.
Review of fees. The connection fees may be reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted by December
31 of each year for the ensuing calendar year. This year-end review shall not preclude the City
from adjusting the connection fee at any other time during the year.
Use of fees. All connection fees received by the City shall be deposited in a segregated interestbearing
account and shall, at the discretion of the City, be used for the future capital needs of the
sewerage system or the retirement of outstanding system debt.
§ 259-6. Right of entry; safety.
Right of entry. The Utility Manager or any other duly authorized City employee bearing proper
credentials and identification may enter:
All properties served by the City's sewerage system, except those directly served by
extraterritorial sanitary districts, for the purpose of inspection, observation, sampling, or
testing, as may be required for the implementation and enforcement of the terms and
provisions of this chapter; and
All private properties through which the City holds a duly negotiated easement for the
purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and
maintenance of any portion of the sewerage system lying within the easement, all subject to
the terms, if any, of the duly negotiated easement.
Entry prevented. In the event that a person prevents, obstructs, or hinders a City employee from
entering the person's property or premises, or from performing any of the activities specified in
above Subsection A, then the City may avail itself of any and all remedies available under the law

[Amended 11-19-2013 by Ord. No. 1973(7)]
Safety. While performing any necessary work on private premises under Subsection A, all duly
authorized City employees shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by
the user. The City shall indemnify the user against loss or damage to its property by City
employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the user growing out of the City's gauging and sampling operations. This
indemnification shall not extend to any loss or damage caused by the user's negligence or failure
to maintain safe conditions.
§ 259-7. Service area.
Generally. The City's sewer service area shall be limited to that area defined in § 259-2, "City's
sewer service area." No other territory shall be deemed a part of the City's sewer service area
unless the sewer service area is altered to expressly include such additional territory within its
boundaries.
Reservation of rights. Notwithstanding Subsection A, the City reserves the right to refuse to
provide sewer service to any currently nonserved property outside the City but within the sewer
service area if:
The property owner refuses to annex to the City;
The available capacity in all downstream wastewater collection and treatment facilities is
insufficient to accommodate the additional wastewater discharge; or
Treatment of the wastewater would cause the City to violate any applicable effluent limitations
or standards, water quality standards, or any other legally applicable requirements.
Implied consent. An owner of property or of any other point source outside the City served by the
City's sewerage system shall be deemed to have consented to be governed by all of the terms
and requirements of this chapter, including payment of the applicable sewer service charges. This
implied consent shall not apply to owners of property located within a town sanitary district if the
district directly provides sewer collection services to that property, has adopted its own sewer use
ordinance, and has entered into an agreement with the City for the provision of sewer treatment
services for the district's users. In that event, the terms and conditions of the sanitary district's
ordinance and of the City - sanitary district agreement shall control.
§ 259-8. Agreements permitted.
Generally.
No provision of this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit a separate or special
contract or arrangement between the City and any industrial, commercial, or any other
category of user within or without the City, or between the City and any other public entity,
including a town sanitary district, whose territory is entirely or partly within the City's sewer
service area. Any such agreement or arrangement shall be subject to approval by the
Common Council and shall be consistent with and subject to the terms and conditions of this
chapter and all applicable state, City and federal laws and regulations.
As part of any special contract or arrangement, the City may agree to accept and treat
industrial wastewater of high strength or of an unusual character, either before or after
pretreatment, provided such wastewater shall not impair the functioning of the City's

period specified in the applicable standard. New sources shall comply with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards on the date their wastewater is first discharged to the
City's sewerage system.
Whenever practicable, the Utility Manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable
recording requirements under this chapter, 40 CFR Part 403, and Ch. NR 211, Wis. Admin.
Code. The failure of the Utility Manager to provide such notification shall not relieve the user
of its reporting responsibilities under either state or federal law.
State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply if they are more
stringent than federal requirements and limitations.
Right of revision. The City may establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements
on discharges to its sewerage system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth
in this chapter.
Dilution prohibited. No user shall increase its use of potable or process water or in any other way
attempt to dilute its wastewater as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the categorical pretreatment standards or in
any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or the state.
Accidental discharges.
Protection facilities. Each user shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of a slug
or of prohibited or regulated substances specified by this chapter. If necessary, facilities to
prevent such accidental discharges shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans and specifications for the facility and proposed operating procedures adopted
to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Utility Manager for review and approval
prior to commencement of its construction. The Utility Manager's review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures, however, shall not relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
Notice. A user shall immediately notify the Utility Manager, either orally or in writing, of the
occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of any substance prohibited or restricted by this
chapter. The notification shall include location, date, and time of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and initial corrective actions taken. Within five days of its initial
notification, the user shall submit a written report to the Utility Manager detailing the nature of
the discharge, the measures already taken, the results of those actions, and the possible
need for permanent corrective measures.
Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall advise all employees who may cause or discover such a
discharge of the emergency notification procedures.
User liability. Any user which discharges a slug or a prohibited or restricted substance shall be
liable to the City for any City-incurred expenses, losses or damages caused by or resulting
from the slug or the discharge of a prohibited or restricted substance, including any fines paid
by the City for violation of any state or federal law. This liability of the user shall be in addition
to any penalties or sanctions imposed by the City on account of the slug or discharge of a
prohibited or restricted substance.

New sources. In addition to any federal or state reporting requirements. each new source
shall prepare and file with the Utility Manager a waste disposal questionnaire form and a
hazardous waste disposal questionnaire form containing actual or predicted data on the
quantity and characteristics of the wastes to be discharged. The new source shall also submit
plans and specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed flow
equalization, pretreatment, or processing facilities to the Utility Manager for review and
approval prior to the start of any construction.
Notification of change. An industrial user shall promptly notify the Utility Manager in advance
of any substantial change in the volume, concentration or character of pollutants in its
discharge, including any hazardous waste as described in Subsection B(2).
Industrial discharges.
If an industrial user discharges, or proposes to discharge, any wastewater or any other waste
to the City's sewerage system which, in the judgment of the Utility Manager, may, either singly
or in combination with other sources, have deleterious effects on the sewerage system,
treatment processes or receiving waters, create a hazard to life or health, or constitute a
public nuisance, the Utility Manager may:
After notice to the industrial user, immediately and effectively halt or prevent the
continued discharge of any or all of the industrial user's wastewater.
After notice to the industrial user and an opportunity to respond, halt or prevent the
discharge of any or all of the industrial user's wastewater.
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition or, if necessary, to normal domestic
strength wastewater for discharge to the City's sewerage system.
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastewater in
accordance with the provisions of § 259-8.
Notification.
As required by 40 CFR § 403.12(p), an industrial user shall notify the City, the EPA, and
the DNR in writing of any discharge to the City's sewerage system of a substance which,
if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. The
notification shall include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part
261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (e.g., continuous,
batch, or other). An industrial user need only submit one notification for each hazardous
waste discharged. However, notification of changed discharges must be submitted in
accordance with the requirements of Subsection A(2).
If the industrial user submits a notification under this Subsection B(2), it shall also certify
to the City that it has a program in place to reduce the volume or toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated to the degree economically practical.
Monitoring facilities.
Each nonresidential user shall, at the discretion of the Utility Manager, construct and maintain
one or more sampling manholes to facilitate inspection, flow measurement, and sampling of
the nonresidential user's wastewater and wastes, including domestic wastewater.
Sampling manholes shall be located and built in a manner acceptable to the Utility Manager
and according to City of Burlington Standard Specifications for Sewer and Water Construction
(see Appendix C).[1] If measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a
type acceptable to the Utility Manager. Plans for installation of the sampling manholes or

The nonresidential user shall install the sampling manholes and related equipment at its own
expense and shall maintain them in a safe, accessible, and operational condition at all times.
If more than one nonresidential user discharges into a common sewer, the Utility Manager
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. If through different
operations a nonresidential user produces waste streams of significantly different constituents
and characteristics, the Utility Manger may require that separate monitoring facilities be
installed for each separate discharge.
Inspection and sampling.
Subject to the approval of the Utility Manager, each significant industrial user, and certain
other industrial users as required by the Utility Manager, shall install, operate, and maintain
inspection and sampling facilities. Access to the inspection and sampling location shall be
provided to the Utility Manager at all times.
Each industrial user shall allow the Utility Manager to enter its premises at all reasonable
hours for purposes of:
Inspection of records, any pretreatment facility maintained and operated on the premises,
and any monitoring facilities;
Sampling;
Setting up on the industrial user's property any additional devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations, if the
devices installed by the user are considered to be inaccurate or malfunctioning; and
Generally ensuring the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter
and all applicable state and federal laws and regulations.
Sampling.
All industrial wastewater discharged into the City's sewerage system shall be subject to
periodic sampling and analysis by the City to determine its character and concentration
for future sewer charge and regulatory purposes. The City's costs for this sampling and
analysis shall be borne by the industrial user.
If an industrial user at any time contests a City determination, the City may, at its sole
discretion, elect to have an independent laboratory determine the character and
concentration of the user's wastewater for future sewer charge and regulatory purposes.
The industrial user shall assume all costs in connection with the work of the independent
laboratory.
All wastewater samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the
composition of the wastewater. Samples shall be collected in a manner to ensure their
preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the samples were taken.
Any of the provisions of Subsection D(1), (2) or (3) may be modified by special agreement
between the City and an industrial user.
Analyses. All measurements, tests, and analyses for the nature, concentration and characteristics
of wastewater shall be performed in accordance with the Standard Methods and with the
applicable regulations and techniques contained in 40 CFR Part 136.

and the Utility Manager shall present to it for consideration. The decision of the Common
Council shall be final and shall be consistent with the City's WPDES permit.
The appeal procedures prescribed by § 259-33 shall control, including the time limitation
for initiation of an appeal.
When granted. To the extent consistent with the Act and the applicable provision of state law,
the Common Council may grant individual variances beyond the limitations prescribed in
§§ 259-10, 259-11 and 259-12 whenever it finds that, based on the presentation of adequate
proof, the user's compliance with the provisions of those sections would result in an
unnecessary hardship to it.
Council findings. The Common Council shall not vary the regulations of this chapter unless it
finds, based on the evidence presented in each case, that:
Because of the particular physical characteristics of the property or wastewater involved,
a particular hardship to the user would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience based on a strict application of the regulations.
The variance sought is based on conditions unique to the property or wastewater
involved and not generally applicable to other properties.
The variance sought is not based solely on economic considerations.
The variance sought is not contrary to the public interest and will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety, and welfare.
The variance sought is not based on a self-created hardship.

Conditions. In granting a variance, the Common Council may impose such conditions,
exceptions, time limitations, duration and other limitations as the policies of this chapter, the
Act, and applicable state law may require.
Agency approval. No variance shall be deemed granted until the City has received written
approval from the EPA and the DNR as to the proposed variance and its terms and
conditions.
Term. A variance granted by the Common Council shall not exceed five years and shall be
granted on the condition that the affected user make periodic progress reports as the
Common Council shall specify. A variance may be extended from year to year by the
Common Council but only if satisfactory progress has been shown.
Issuance of permit. If the Common Council reverses the Utility Manager's determination, the
Utility Manager shall issue to the significant industrial user a discharge permit within 10 days
of the Council's decision. The Utility Manager shall incorporate into the permit any appropriate
condition specified in Subsection C and all limitations expressly imposed by the Council
through its decision.

violated, it may be revoked on 30 days' written notice to the user. Within that thirty-day period,
the affected user may request a hearing on the proposed revocation. The hearing shall be
conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed by § 259-33.
Permit modifications.
The terms and conditions of a permit may be modified by the Utility Manager during the term
of the permit as limitations or requirements prescribed by this chapter or by federal or state
law are revised or as other just causes exist. The user shall be informed of any proposed
changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes
or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
Whenever a national categorical pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement is
promulgated, the Utility Manager shall revise the discharge permit of those users subject to
such standard or requirement to require the users' compliance within the time frame
prescribed by the standard or requirement.
Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. A discharge permit shall not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, user,
different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the Utility Manager. Any
successor owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit.
Order to cease. If a significant industrial user discharges any waste materially or substantially
different in type, nature, or volume than allowed by the discharge permit, it shall immediately, on
order of the Utility Manager, discontinue its discharge and shall be subject to any penalties or
other sanctions provided by this chapter.

corresponding licensed disposer, within 15 days of approval, a permit effective on the date of
issuance. The Utility Manager shall notify each affected licensed disposer of a rejection within
15 days of the action.
Rejection of application. The Utility Manager shall reject an application for disposal of septage
by a licensed disposer if:
Treatment of the licensed disposer's proposed septage would cause the City's sewerage
system to exceed its operating design capacity or to violate any applicable effluent
limitations or standards, water quality standards, or any other applicable requirements,
including court orders or state or federal statutes, rules, regulations or orders.
The licensed disposer's proposed septage is not compatible with the City's sewerage
system.
In previous years, the licensed disposer has repeatedly failed to comply with material
provisions of the City's septage disposal rules or of the disposal plan prepared for the
licensed disposer.
§ 259-17. Permit conditions.

Article IV. Sewer Service Charges
§ 259-20. Sewer service charge system established.
The City shall establish and collect sewer service charges from users of its sewerage system. For
purposes of this section, this system includes, without limitation, all facilities within or without the
City for collection, transportation, pumping, treatment and disposal of sewage and water-carried
wastes created in and to be conveyed away from residential, commercial, governmental,
institutional and industrial buildings, structures and facilities in conjunction with the wastewater
treatment plant.
It shall be the policy of the City to establish sewer service charges in an amount sufficient to i) pay
for the costs of the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system (including contributions to
a replacement fund); ii) pay for the debt service (including debt service reserves and coverage
requirements) of the financial obligations pertaining to the sewerage system; and iii) establish a
reserve fund for future projects and/or other expenses.
[Amended 11-19-2013 by Ord. No. 1973(7)]
The City may establish sewer service charges, including customer service charges, volumetric
user charges, surcharges for certain industrial users, charges for testing, treatment and disposal
of specialized wastes, charges to extraterritorial customers and other charges, as deemed
necessary by the Common Council so as to assure that each user of the sewerage system pays
its proportionate share of the cost of such facilities.
[Amended 11-18-2003 by Ord. No. 1740(20)]

A review of the sewer service charge system shall be conducted at least once every five years.
This review shall include an analysis of the total costs of the system and of the wastewater
contribution of users and user classes. A review of sewer system capital improvement needs shall
also be conducted at least once every five years.
The charges established hereunder will be developed using a cash-based method for determining
revenue requirements for rate-making purposes.
All sewer service charges shall be computed under the direction of the Utility Manager and shall
be furnished to the Common Council. The Council shall establish sewer user charges by
resolution.
§ 259-21. Types of charges and basis for charges.
Customer service charge. A customer service charge will be imposed upon each user connected
to the sewerage system. The customer service charges shall recover costs related to wastewater
treatment flow not directly attributable to users (infiltration/inflow) and administrative costs relating
to the sewerage system. The customer service charge shall be levied to each connection to the
sewerage system and will consist of a flat fee per connection.
Sewer use charge.
Establishment of charge. A sewer use charge will be hereby imposed upon all users of the
sewer system. The charge will recover the component of total operation, maintenance, and
capital costs of the sewerage system which relate to sewerage flow attributable to users of
the system. The sewer use charge shall be based upon the cost of treating flow, BOD,
suspended solids, Total-P, and septage at the strength of domestic wastewater. The sewer
use charge shall consist of a volumetric charge in terms of dollars per hundred cubic feet.
[Amended 11-19-2013 by Ord. No. 1973(7)]
Basis for charge.
Nonindustrial users.
Metered water customers. Each lot, parcel of land or nonindustrial building
connected to the City's sewerage system and served by the City's public water
supply system shall be assessed a sewer use charge based in part on the quantity
of water used as measured by the Burlington Water Utility water meter provided for
those premises.
Private wells.
If any nonindustrial user of the City's sewerage system procures any or all of its
water from sources other than the City's Water Utility, all or part of which is
discharges into the City's sewerage system, that user shall cause to be installed
a water meter for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
these other sources. The necessary water meter shall be furnished by the City's
Water Utility and installed under its supervision. The costs for the installation of
the meter shall be borne by the user. If a sewer meter is already installed, a
water meter shall not be required.
The City's Water Utility shall establish a rental charge for each meter to
compensate it for the cost of furnishing and servicing the meter. The meter
rental charge shall be included in each of the user's sewer service bills.
The requirements of this Subsection B(2)(b) shall not apply to any user located
within and served directly by an extraterritorial sanitary district.

Irrigation allowance for residential users. The metered residential water use shall be
adjusted to account for consumptive water use during the summer in the following
manner:
On January 1, April 1 and July 1, the volume used as a basis for the sewer
service charges shall be equal to the water volume read by the City's Water
Utility for the water bill for the previous quarter.
On October 1, the volume used as the basis for the sewer service charge shall
be the water volume read by the City's Water Utility for the preceding quarter's
water bill, limited to the extent that the volume in October shall not exceed the
volume read in the preceding April. This limitation shall only apply if the
preceding April charge was based on a full quarter.
For purposes of the irrigation allowance, "residential users" is limited to all
single-family residences and duplexes.
Multiunit residential dwellings of three or more units served by a single water
meter and which request credit for water not discharging into the sewerage
system shall be required to install a separate water meter, and no sewerage
charge shall be made for this amount of discharge. The property owner making
this request shall make application and payment for such separate water meter
to the Waterworks Utility Manager. The property owner shall provide proof to the
City Plumbing Inspector that the discharge to be metered does not go to the
sewerage system. The property owner shall engage a plumber to take out a
plumbing permit, make the necessary piping changes, and install such meter
according to the City-approved plans and specifications. The property owner
must agree to allow the City to inspect and/or remove the meter for repair. If the
owner requests a disconnect of said meter and later a reconnect, a reconnect
charge would be payable to the City's Water Utility.
If a user elects to install a separate water meter to record water not discharged
to the sewerage system, other than lawn irrigation, provisions must be made by
the owner at his expense to discharge this water to the storm sewer system.
Industrial users.
Measurement of flow. The volume of flow for computing sewer service charges shall
be based on the records of sewage meter readings maintained by the industrial user
or, if approved by the Utility Manager, based on the water consumption of the
industrial user as shown in the records of the water meter readings maintained by
the Burlington Water Utility, except as provided in Subsection B(2)(b)[2] and [3].
[Amended 11-19-2013 by Ord. No. 1973(7)]
Deduction. If an industrial user can produce satisfactory evidence for the Utility
Manager that more than 10% of its total annual volume of water used for all
purposes is not discharged into the City's sewerage system, the Utility Manager and
the affected user shall mutually agree on the level of water consumption to be used
for computation of volume for purposes of the sewer service charge. If the Utility
Manager and the industrial user fail to agree, the Utility Manager shall unilaterally
determine in a reasonable manner a percentage of water measured by the meter
actually discharged to the City's sewerage system. In the alternative, the Utility
Manager may require the installation of other or additional meters to measure the
volume of discharged wastewater as permitted by Subsection B(2)(b)[3].
Metering of waste. The Utility Manager may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of wastewater discharged if the wastewater volume cannot be
otherwise determined from the metered water consumption. These wastewater

metering devices shall be installed, owned and maintained by the industrial user.
Once installed, these meters may not be removed without the consent of the Utility
Manager.
Surcharges for certain industrial users.
A surcharge shall be levied on all users of the system that discharge wastes which have
concentrations of BOD, suspended solids or total phosphorus (Total-P) greater than domestic
wastewater. The surcharge shall apply to any additional loadings over and above that which
would be generated by wastes at a strength equal to domestic wastewater. The volume of
flow used for computing waste surcharges shall be the amount of metered water consumption
or an alternative method for determining billable flow volume as defined in Subsection B(2)
(b). The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City in removing BOD,
suspended solids and total phosphorous. The surcharges in a given period shall be computed
on the basis of the following formulas:
[Amended 11-19-2013 by Ord. No. 1973(7)]
Surcharge = [(B-175) x .00834 x Vu] x Bc
Surcharge = [(S-360) x .00834 x Vu] x Sc
Surcharge = [(P-4) x .00834 x Vu] x Pc
Surcharge = Surcharge for BOD
Surcharge = Surcharge for Suspended Solids
Surcharge = Surcharge for Total-P
Bc = Costs for treatment of a unit (pound) of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
B = Concentration of BOD (mg/l)
Sc = Costs for treatment of a unit (pound) of suspended solids
S = Concentration of suspended solids (mg/l)
Pc = Costs for treatment of a unit (pound) of total phosphorous
P = Concentration of total phosphorous (mg/l)
Vu = Billable flow volume in thousands of gallons
Pollutants. The measurement for and determination of BOD, suspended solids, and Total-P
charges shall be made on the basis of laboratory analyses of periodic composite sewage
samples.
Specialized waste disposal charges.
Charges shall be imposed for testing, treatment and disposal of specialized waste, including
septic tank waste, holding tank waste and other wastes which are deemed acceptable for
treatment and disposal, by the Utility Manager. Charges shall be based on flow, BOD,
suspended solids, Total-P and such other constituents which affect the cost of treatment and
disposal and shall consist of a volumetric charge in terms of dollars per thousand gallons.
[Amended 11-18-2003 by Ord. No. 1740(20)]
All costs associated with administering the discharge of septage to the WTF, including sample
collection, laboratory analysis and billing, will be paid by the specialized waste hauler.
Charges to extraterritorial users.
Municipal sanitary sewer service may be provided to extraterritorial locations upon approval
by the Common Council.
Extraterritorial sewer recipients shall pay sewer user charges as established in an
intermunicipal agreement (§ 66.0301, Wis. Stats.).

Connection fees (see § 259-5). A connection fee shall be collected by the City from all new
connections to the sewerage system or existing wastewater connections which have a change in
operations or activity resulting in the utilization of additional sewerage system capacity. This
charge shall be calculated and collected as provided in § 259-5 of this chapter.
Special rates. It is understood that the Common Council may at any time hereafter set special
rates for any large commercial service, industrial use, extraterritorial areas, contract users or any
other unique user that does not readily fit into other categories of users. Special rates may be
established to ensure that any user discharging toxic pollutants, wastewater or other wastes to the
sewerage system shall pay for the increased operation, maintenance and capital costs caused by
their discharge.
§ 259-22. Administration and billing.
Customer classification.
Generally. For purposes of the City's user charge system, four categories of customer
classifications are established: Category A, Category B, extraterritorial and other users.
Category A users. The class of Category A users shall consist of those users whose
wastewater discharge is deemed to be normal domestic strength wastewater. This category
includes all City and non-City users of the City's sewerage system, except as otherwise
provided in Subsection A(3) and (4).
Category B users. The class of Category B users shall consist of those users whose
wastewater discharge is deemed to be high-strength wastewater.
Extraterritorial users. The class of extraterritorial users shall consist of users served in areas
outside of the City limits.
Other users. The class of other users shall consist of haulers of specialized wastes.
Computation of charges. The methodology for computation of the sewer service charges for the
various customer classifications shall be as set forth in i) the most recent sanitary sewer study
approved by the City's Common Council; and/or ii) as otherwise provided for in this chapter or
action of the City's Common Council.
[Amended 11-19-2013 by Ord. No. 1973(7)]
Billing period. For all Category A users, the sewer service charges shall be included with the water
bill on a quarterly basis. For all other users of the system, the sewer service charges shall be
billed by the Utility Manager on a monthly basis.
Payment of bills.
All sewer service charges shall be paid in full within 20 calendar days after each specified
billing date. If a service charge bill is not paid when due, a penalty of 3% of the total sewer
service charge shall be added immediately to the bill, and the total shall be deemed
delinquent for purposes of the user's sewer account. If the delinquent service charges are not
paid within 30 days after the last allowable due date for payment, an additional 1 1/2% shall
be applied to the total unpaid balance for sewer service, including the unpaid late payment
penalty. This charge of 1 1/2% shall be assessed thereafter on a monthly basis, or fraction
thereof, against the total unpaid balance until all of the accrued charges are fully paid.
All service charge bills shall be payable at the office of the Water Utility. Payment made or
mailed and postmarked on or before the last day of the twenty-day calendar period shall
constitute payment within that time period. If the end of the twenty-day calendar period falls

on a legal holiday or a Sunday, payment made or mailed and postmarked on the next
succeeding weekday which is not a legal holiday shall constitute payment within that period.
Each nonoccupant owner of a lot, parcel of land, building or premises served by the City's
sewerage system shall notify the Water Utility of his present address. The failure of an owner
or occupant to receive a bill for sewer service charges shall not be considered an excuse for
nonpayment or grounds for an extension of the time period required for payment of the bill.
If more than one user is served by a single meter, the sewer service charge shall be served
on the property owner.
If a customer moves from a location within a billing period, the meter shall be read and the
charges for the sewer service shall be prorated.
Annual customer notification. The City shall provide each user with an annual notice of the sewer
service charge rates. This notice shall be provided to Category A users with their sewer service bill
for the last quarter of each year and to all other users with their sewer service bill for November.
Charges a lien.
Any delinquent sewer service charge, together with all assessed late payment penalties and
charges, may become a lien on the premises to which the sewer service was furnished and
thereafter taxed and collected in the manner provided in § 66.0809, Wis. Stats. In addition to
or in lieu of this method of collection, the City may initiate civil action against a user for
recovery of unpaid delinquent service charges and penalties.
A change of ownership or occupancy of a premises shall not be cause for reducing or
eliminating any debt or lien created by unpaid sewer service bills.
§ 259-23. Disconnection of service.
Procedure.
If a user fails to pay any sewer service charge within 30 days after becoming delinquent, the
Utility Manager may serve personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, on the user a written disconnect notice and order. The order shall become
effective 20 days after the date of the notice, unless the user serves on the Utility Manager a
written objection to the disconnect order before expiration of the twenty-day period. If the user
disputes the disconnection order, the Utility Manager shall promptly investigate the dispute
and shall attempt to resolve the dispute by negotiation. During this investigation and
negotiation period, the City shall not disconnect the user's sewer service over that matter.
If the disputed disconnection order cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the Utility
Manager, he shall serve personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
a second written disconnect order on the user and inform the user that the disconnect order
shall take effect 20 days after the date of the order unless the user appeals the disconnect
order to the Common Council within the twenty-day period.
The user's failure to object to the initial disconnect order under Subsection A(1) or to appeal
the order under Subsection A(2) within 20 days shall constitute a waiver of the user's rights to
challenge the issuance of the order or its validity.
If the user appeals the disconnect order to the Common Council, a written notice thereafter
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of the hearing to be held by the
Common Council on the matter of the user's objections to the disconnect order. The notice of

This section does not apply to any action proposed or taken by the City to disconnect sewer

If a user violates any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained in this chapter, including any
of those conditions specified in § 259-26 or, if applicable, in a City-issued wastewater discharge
permit, the Utility Manager may serve on the user, either personally or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, a written notice stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within 20
days after the date of the notice, the user, based on the express order of the Utility Manager in the
notice, shall either:
Immediately and permanently correct or cease such violation; or
Submit a response to the allegations and provide a plan, if appropriate, for the satisfactory
correction of the violation to the Utility Manager. If the user's response is satisfactory to the
Utility Manager and the user complies with a submitted plan, if appropriate, the City shall not
take any further action against the user.
If a user fails to comply with the notice issued under Subsection B within 20 days, it shall be
subject to any of the penalties or sanctions permitted by §§ 259-25, 259-26, 259-27, 259-28 and

following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related equipment shall have been installed or existing treatment
facilities, devices or other related equipment is properly operated. If a user subsequently violates a
Council-issued order, the City may initiate action in accordance with § 259-28 or 259-29, or both.
§ 259-26. Termination of service.
In accordance with the procedures prescribed by §§ 259-24 and 259-25, the City may terminate the
sewer service or, if applicable, revoke the discharge permit of any user which violates any condition or
term of this chapter, any applicable state or federal law or regulation, or any of the following conditions:
Failure of the user to report factually the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge.
Tampering with sampling or flow measurement equipment and/or analyses conducted by or at the
direction of the City.
§ 259-27. Suspension of service.
In accordance with the procedures prescribed by §§ 259-24 and 259-25, the Utility Manager may
suspend, by written notice, sewer service to a particular premises, facility or building if suspension
is necessary, in the opinion of the Utility Manager, to stop an actual or threatened discharge that
presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or
to the environment, causes or may cause interference to the City's sewerage system, or causes or
may cause the City to violate any condition of its WPDES permit.
Any user notified of a suspension of its sewer service shall immediately stop or eliminate the
introduction of wastewater into the City's sewerage system. If the user fails to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the City may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewerage
system or danger to any persons. The City shall reinstate the sewer service, at the user's
expense, on proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge.

This chapter supersedes all conflicting and contradictory stormwater management regulations
previously enacted under § 62.23, Wis. Stats. Except as specifically provided for in § 62.234, Wis.
Stats., § 62.23, Wis. Stats., applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter.
The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the
same governing body.
The Common Council hereby designates the City Engineer to administer and enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
The requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent stormwater management
requirements that may be imposed by the administrative rules, permits or approvals of the
Department of Natural Resources, including but not limited to those authorized under § 283.33,
Wis. Stats.
§ 270-2. Findings of fact.
The Common Council finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land development and land
redevelopment activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and
general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources.
Specifically, uncontrolled stormwater runoff can:
Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour,
diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream
temperature.
Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, and recreational and water
supply uses by increasing loadings of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals,
bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.
Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,
drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities.
Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and
volumes.
Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.
§ 270-3. Purpose and intent.
Purpose. The general purpose of this chapter is to set forth stormwater requirements and criteria
which will diminish the threats to public health, safety and welfare and the aquatic environment
due to runoff of stormwater from land development and land redevelopment activity. Specific
purposes are to:
Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater, prevent and control soil erosion,
prevent and control water pollution, and protect spawning grounds, fish, and aquatic life.
Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water
bodies, prevent undue channel erosion, control increases in the scouring and transportation

of particulate matter, and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property.
Control building sites, placement of structures, and land uses and promote sound economic
growth.
Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the
waters of the state.
Intent. It is the intent of the Common Council that this chapter manage the long-term, postconstruction
stormwater discharges from land development and land redevelopment activities by
achieving a specific set of performance standards at locations where it applies.
This chapter can be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Common Council recognizes,
however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set
forth in this chapter is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive,
systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as
watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe alternative
applicability and performance standards for specific sites when the overall performance
standards can be met in a more cost-effective approach.
Where such plans have been developed, and approved by the Common Council, it is the
intent of this chapter that land development and redevelopment activity as defined in
§ 270-4 will be required to meet the stormwater management measures set forth in the
approved plan.
Where such stormwater management plans have not been developed, and approved by
the Common Council, it is the intent that the stormwater management standards set forth
in § 270-7A and B of this chapter be applied unless otherwise excepted by the Common
Council.
This chapter shall not apply to lands on which the only structures are buildings existing on the
effective date of this chapter, which are not redeveloped in a manner that increases discharge
volume after the effective date of this chapter.
§ 270-4. Definitions.

§ 270-5. Applicability and jurisdiction.
Applicability. Except as described below, this chapter applies to a post-construction site
whereupon one acre or more of land-disturbing construction activity occurs during construction.
Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in Subsection A, this chapter applies to postconstruction
sites of any size that, as determined by the City Engineer, are likely to result in
runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receiving body of
water, causes undue channel erosion, or increases water pollution by scouring or the
transportation of particulate matter.
This chapter applies to construction activities that are smaller than one acre if such activities
are part of a larger common plan of development or sale that in total affects one or more
acres.

Underground utility construction, but not including the construction of any aboveground
structures associated with utility construction, are exempt from the provisions of this chapter.
A post-construction site with less than 10% connected imperviousness, based on the area of
land disturbance, provided the cumulative area of all impervious surfaces is less than one
acre, is exempt from the provisions of this chapter. However, the exemption of this subsection
does not include exemption from the protective area standards of this chapter.
Jurisdiction. This chapter applies to land development and land redevelopment activities within the
boundaries of City of Burlington. This chapter applies to all lands located within the extraterritorial
plat approval jurisdiction of the City of Burlington, even if plat approval is not involved.
Exclusions. This chapter is not applicable to activities conducted by a state agency, as defined
under § 227.01(1), Wis. Stats.
§ 270-5.1. Applicability of maximum extent practicable.
Maximum extent practicable applies when a person who is subject to a performance standard of
this chapter demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that a performance standard is not
achievable and that a lower level of performance is appropriate. In making the assertion that a
performance standard is not achievable and that a level of performance different from the
performance standard is the maximum extent practicable, the responsible party shall take into
account the best available technology, cost effectiveness, geographic features, and other
competing interests such as protection of public safety and welfare, protection of endangered and
threatened resources, and preservation of historic properties.
§ 270-6. Design standards.
Unless prior authorization is given by the City Engineer, the following methods shall be used in
designing the water quality, peak discharge, and infiltration components of stormwater practices
needed to meet the water quality standards of this chapter:
Consistent with the technical standards identified, developed or disseminated by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources under Subchapter V of Ch. NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code.
Where technical standards have not been identified, or developed by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, other technical standards may be used provided that the methods have been
approved by the City Engineer.
Maintenance of effort. For redevelopment sites where the redevelopment will be replacing older
development that was subject to post-construction performance standards of Ch. NR 151, Wis.
Adm. Code, in effect on or after October 1, 2004, the responsible party shall meet the total
suspended solids reduction, peak flow control, infiltration, and protective areas standards
applicable to the older development or meet the redevelopment standards of this chapter,
whichever is more stringent.
A written stormwater management plan in accordance with § 270-9 shall be developed and
implemented for each post-construction site.

Stormwater discharge quantity. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, all land development
and land redevelopment activities subject to this chapter shall establish onsite management
practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharged from the site and to preserve
base flow in streams. The BMPs shall be designed, installed or applied and maintained to the
maximum extent practicable in accordance with a stormwater management plan for the long-term
control of post-construction stormwater discharges. All of the following apply:
By design, maintain or reduce the peak runoff discharge rates as compared to
predevelopment conditions for the one-, two- and ten-year, twenty-four-hour design storms
applicable to the site, assuming good hydrologic conditions for predevelopment land covers
as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent methodology. Storage shall be provided to
accommodate up to a one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design storm for post-development
land cover with a maximum discharge rate of the ten-year predevelopment rate.
Predevelopment runoff curve numbers in Table 1 shall be used. Peak discharges shall be
calculated using TR-55 runoff curve number methodology, Atlas 14 precipitation depths, and
the appropriate NRCS Wisconsin MSE3 or MSE4 precipitation distribution. On a case-bycase
basis, the City Engineer may allow the use of TP-40 precipitation depths and the Type II
distribution.

Discharge velocities must be nonerosive to discharge locations, outfall channels, and
receiving streams.
Minimize to the extent practical increases or decreases in the hydrology of wetlands. Where
such changes are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be
assessed using a methodology acceptable to the City Engineer. Significant degradation of
wetland functional values shall be avoided. Acceptable assessment methodologies can be
found in a guide prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, Water Quality Standards
for Wetlands: A Regulator's Guide, Bureau of Water Regulation and Zoning, September 1992.
This subsection of the chapter does not apply to any of the following:
A post-construction site where the discharge is directly into a lake over 5,000 acres or a
stream or river segment draining more than 500 square miles;
Except as provided under § 270-6C, a redevelopment post-construction site;
An infill development of less than five acres.
Stormwater discharge quality. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, all land development
and land redevelopment activities subject to this chapter shall establish onsite management
practices to control the discharge of stormwater pollutants. The BMPs shall be designed, installed
or applied and maintained in accordance with a stormwater management plan for the long-term
control of post-construction stormwater discharges, to control total suspended solids and other
pollutants carried in runoff to the maximum extent practicable. All of the following apply:
BMPs shall be designed in accordance with Table 2 or to the maximum extent practicable as
provided in Subsection B(6). The design shall be based on an average annual rainfall, as
compared to no runoff management controls.

Petroleum products in runoff from gas station pump areas and vehicle maintenance areas
shall be controlled with a properly designed and maintained oil and grease separator or other
equivalent practice, which shall remove all visible sheen from the runoff prior to discharge to
waters of the state. A gas station pump area which has a properly designed canopy that
catches and directs stormwater away from the potential spill areas beneath it and the
availability and use of petroleum absorbent pads to immediately clean up spills shall be
allowed as an equivalent practice to meet this subsection.
Sufficient permanent vegetative cover shall be provided in riparian areas to provide for bank
stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow
areas. The minimum width of the riparian area is the width calculated using the procedures in
NRCS Standard 393, dated January 1995, or 35 feet, whichever is greater. Riparian area
widths are measured from the ordinary high-water mark of lakes, streams and wetlands. This
subsection is not applicable to redevelopment sites or to structures that cross or access
surface waters, such as boat landings, bridges and culverts.
Discharge of urban stormwater pollutants to wetlands from land development and land
redevelopment sites shall be minimized to the extent practical. Where such discharges are
proposed, the impact of the proposed discharge on wetland functional values shall be
assessed using a method acceptable to the City Engineer. At a minimum, stormwater
discharges shall be pretreated prior to discharge to wetlands. Significant degradation of
wetland functional values due to stormwater pollutant loads shall be avoided.
Stormwater ponds and infiltration devices shall not be located closer to water supply wells
than as indicated below without first notifying and obtaining approval from the City Engineer:
One hundred feet from a well serving a private water system or a transient,
noncommunity public water system.
One thousand two hundred feet from a well serving a municipal public water system, an
other-than municipal public water system, or a nontransient, noncommunity public water
system.
The boundary of a recharge area to a wellhead identified in a wellhead area protection
plan.
Maximum extent practicable. If the design cannot meet a total suspended solids reduction
performance standard of Table 2, the stormwater management plan shall include a written,
site-specific explanation of why the total suspended solids reduction performance standard
cannot be met and why the total suspended solids load will be reduced only to the maximum
extent practicable.
Off-site drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from off site shall be
taken into account in determining the treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the
efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP accordingly.
Infiltration.
Best management practices. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate
runoff in accordance with the following or to the maximum extent practicable:

Low imperviousness. For development up to 40% connected imperviousness, such as
parks, cemeteries, and low-density residential development, infiltrate sufficient runoff
volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 90% of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than 1% of
the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area.
Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than 40% and up to 80%
connected imperviousness, such as medium and high density residential, multifamily
development, industrial and institutional development, and office parks, infiltrate sufficient
runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 75% of
the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However,
when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than
2% of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area.
High imperviousness. For development with more than 80% connected imperviousness,
such as commercial strip malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least
60% of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no
more than 2% of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area.
Pre-development. The pre-development condition shall be the same as specified in Table 1 of
the peak discharge section of this chapter.

Groundwater standards.
Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this section shall, to the extent
technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to
groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of
standards application in accordance with Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site
specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not
achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent
infiltration to the maximum extent practicable.
Notwithstanding Subsection C(6)(a), the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the
enforcement standard at the point of standards application.
Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff
and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas that
will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration
system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in
accordance with Subsection C(6). Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil
and grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips.
Maximum extent practicable. Where the conditions of Subsection C(3) and (4) limit or restrict
the use of infiltration practices, the performance standard of § 270-7C shall be met to the
maximum extent practicable.
Protective areas.
Definition. In this section, "protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top
of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and
that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the
channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this
section, "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed
within a pipe or culvert, so that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location.
For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet.
For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a United States Geological Survey
7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever is more
current, 50 feet.
For lakes, 50 feet.
For wetlands not subject to Subsection D(1)(e) or (f), 50 feet.
For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the
following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open and coniferous bogs, low
prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds.
For less susceptible wetlands, 10% of the average wetland width, but no less than 10
feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include: degraded wetland
dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass; cultivated hydric soils; and
any gravel pits, or dredged material or fill material disposal sites that take on the
attributes of a wetland.
In Subsection D(1)(d) to (f), determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent
to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the
wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in § NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance with § NR 103.08 (1m), Wis.
Adm. Code. This subsection does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled

in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for
wetlands that have been partially filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal
regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after a fill has been
placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need
not be met in that location.
For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, 10 feet.
Notwithstanding Subsection D(1)(a) to (i), the greatest protective area width shall apply
where rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands are contiguous.
Applicability. This section applies to post-construction sites located within a protective area,
except those areas exempted pursuant to Subsection D(4).
Requirements. The following requirements shall be met:
Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area entirely or to the maximum
extent practicable. If there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in
the protective area, the stormwater management plan shall contain a written, site-specific
explanation.
Where land-disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, adequate sod
or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70% or greater shall be established and maintained
where no impervious surface is present. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative
cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat, and
filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative
materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to
prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur.
BMPs such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention ponds, that are designed to control
pollutants from nonpoint sources, may be located in the protective area.
Exemptions. This section does not apply to any of the following:
Except as provided under § 270-6C, redevelopment post-construction sites.
In-fill development areas less than five acres.
Structures that cross or access surface water such as boat landings, bridges, and
culverts.
Structures constructed in accordance with § 59.692(1v), Wis. Stats.
Areas of post-construction sites from which the runoff does not enter the surface water,
including wetlands, without first being treated by a BMP to meet the local ordinance
requirements for total suspended solids and peak flow reduction, except to the extent that
vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
Swale treatment for transportation facilities.
Requirement. Except as provided in Subsection E(2), transportation facilities that use swales
for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal are exempt from the requirements of local
ordinance requirements for peak flow control, total suspended solids control, and infiltration, if
the swales are designed to do all of the following or to the maximum extent practicable:
Swales shall be vegetated. However, where appropriate, nonvegetative measures may
be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap
stabilization or check dams.

"Vegetated Infiltration Swales," dated May 2007, or a superseding document.
Transportation facility swale treatment does not have to comply with other sections of
Technical Standard 1005.
Other requirements.
Notwithstanding Subsection E(1), the administering authority may, consistent with water
quality standards, require that other requirements, in addition to swale treatment, be met
on a transportation facility with an average daily traffic rate greater than 2,500 and where
the initial surface water of the state that the runoff directly enters is one of the following:
An outstanding resource water.
An exceptional resource water.
Waters listed in § 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act that are identified as
impaired, in whole or in part, due to nonpoint source impacts.
Water where targeted performance standards are developed pursuant to § NR
151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
The transportation facility authority shall contact the City Engineer to determine if
additional BMPs beyond a water quality swale are needed under this subsection.
General considerations for stormwater management measures. The following considerations shall
be observed in on-site and off-site runoff management:
Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions,
native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved
and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this section.
Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be provided to prevent exceeding
the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream
property or public safety.
BMP location.
To comply with the performance standards required under § 270-7 of this chapter, BMPs may
be located on-site or off-site as part of a regional stormwater device, practice or system, but
shall be installed in accordance with § NR 151.003, Wis. Adm. Code.
The City Engineer may approve off-site management measures provided that all of the
following conditions are met:
The City Engineer determines that the post-construction runoff is covered by a
stormwater management system plan that is approved by the City of Burlington and that
contains management requirements consistent with the purpose and intent of this
chapter.
The off-site facility meets all of the following conditions:
The facility is in place.
The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting
the performance standards of this chapter.

Where a regional treatment option exists such that the City Engineer exempts the applicant
from all or part of the minimum on-site stormwater management requirements, the applicant
shall be required to pay a fee in an amount determined in negotiation with the City Engineer.
In determining the fee for post-construction runoff, the City Engineer shall consider an
equitable distribution of the cost for land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance
of the regional treatment option.
Exceptions. The City Engineer may establish stormwater management requirements either more
stringent or less stringent than those set forth in Subsections A and B, provided that at least one
of the following conditions applies:
The City Engineer determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect sensitive
resources.
The City Engineer determines that the land development and land redevelopment activity is
covered by an approved stormwater management system plan that contains management
requirements consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility, provided that all of the
following conditions for the off-site facility are met:
The facility is in place.
The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the
performance standards of this chapter.
The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and
maintenance.
The City Engineer finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements of this
chapter is not feasible due to space or site restrictions.
Fee in lieu of on-site stormwater management practices. Where the City Engineer waives under
§ 270-8C all or part of the minimum on-site stormwater management requirements,
notwithstanding § 270-8C(1), the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount determined
in negotiation with the City of Burlington and approved by the Common Council. The purpose of
the fee is to fund alternative municipal stormwater management measures to offset the
environmental and flooding impacts of waiving the requirements. In determining the fee for land
development and land redevelopment projects, the City shall consider an equitable distribution of
the cost needed for land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater
management practices. All such fees collected shall be placed in a designated fund to be used
exclusively for the City stormwater management practices to be constructed.
§ 270-8. Permit procedure.
Permit required. No landowner or land operator may undertake a land development or land
redevelopment activity subject to this chapter without receiving a permit from the City prior to
commencing the proposed activity.
Permit application and fee. Unless specifically excluded by this chapter, any landowner or operator
desiring a permit shall submit to the City a permit application made on a form provided by the City
of Burlington for that purpose.

Right of entry: inspecting and sampling. The Director of Public Works shall be permitted to enter
and inspect properties and facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.
If a property or facility has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the owner or operator shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Director of Public Works.
Facility owners and operators shall allow the Director of Public Works ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of
records.
The Director of Public Works shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Director of Public Works to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
The Director of Public Works has the right to require the owner or operator to install
monitoring equipment as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the Director of
Public Works. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to
be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the
written or oral request of the Director of Public Works and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works access to a facility is a violation
of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility commits an offense if the person
denies the Director of Public Works reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
Special inspection warrant. If the Director of Public Works has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the Director of Public Works is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is
a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to
verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the Director of Public Works may
seek issuance of a special inspection warrant per § 66.0119, Wis. Stats.
§ 271-12. Prevention, control, and reduction of stormwater
pollutants.
The owner or operator of any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into waters of the state or the MS4 through the use of
structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, that is,
or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to waters of
the state or the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid permit authorizing the
discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity or construction activity, to the maximum
extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
§ 271-13. Notification of spills.

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or
operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any
known or suspected release of materials which is resulting or may result in illicit discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4, or waters of the state, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release, so as to
minimize the impacts of the discharge.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services, and shall also
notify the Director of Public Works. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said
person shall notify the Director of Public Works in person or by phone or email or facsimile no later
than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the Director of Public Works within three business days of the
phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written
record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be
retained for at least five years.
Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this chapter.
§ 271-14. Violations and penalties; enforcement.
Violations.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the
requirements of this chapter. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this chapter may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or
may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the
Director of Public Works is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without
giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation. The
Director of Public Works is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in § 271-15.
Warning notice. When the Director of Public Works finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the Director of
Public Works may serve upon that person a verbal or written warning notice, specifying the
violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the
matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or
resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in the
subsection shall limit the authority of the Director of Public Works to take action, including
emergency action or any other enforcement action without first issuing a warning notice.
Notice of violation.
Whenever the Director of Public Works finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed
to meet a requirement of this chapter, the Director of Public Works may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person.
The notice of violation shall contain:

Works by filing a written notice of appeal within five business days of service of notice of
violation; and
A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore compliance within the
established time schedule, representatives of the Director of Public Works may issue a
notice of intent to the responsible party of its intent to perform work necessary to comply
with this chapter. The Director of Public Works may go on the land and commence the
work after issuing the notice of intent. The Director of Public Works is authorized to seek
costs of the abatement as outlined in § 271-15.
Such notice may require without limitation:
The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the
restoration of any affected property;

Emergency cease-and-desist orders.
When the Director of Public Works finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past
violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or
contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the state which
reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to
the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
violator to:
Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
Take such appropriate preventative action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall
immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a
discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the Director
of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to
the MS4 or waters of the state, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment,
including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other

municipal utility services. The Director of Public Works may allow the person to recommence
its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that
the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this chapter.
A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Public
Works within 30 days of receipt of the notice of violation.
Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Director of Public Works may,
without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or
waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the Director of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Director of
Public Works will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the Director of Public Works.
Prosecution and penalties.
Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less
than $25 nor more than $1,000 and the costs of prosecution for each violation. Each day a
violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
The Director of Public Works may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions,
such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, river bank cleanup, etc.
Compliance with the provisions of this chapter may also be enforced by injunction in any court
with jurisdiction. It shall not be necessary to prosecute for forfeiture or a cease and desist
order before resorting to injunctional proceedings.

The costs of the work performed by the Director of Public Works pursuant to this chapter, plus interest
at the rate authorized by the City of Burlington shall be billed to the responsible party. In the event a
responsible party fails to pay the amount due, the clerk shall enter the amount due on the tax rolls and

establishing said system, South Kane, North Kane, that part of Milwaukee Avenue from Kane
Street to the quarter section line of Section Number 32 of Town Three North, Range Nineteen
East and said quarter section line from Milwaukee Avenue to the City limits shall constitute
the north and south base line from which the numbers on all houses and buildings running
east and west from said streets shall be extended each way upon the basis of one number for
approximately each 15 feet of property frontage, wherever possible, starting at the base line
with the number 100 and continuing with consecutive hundreds at each intersection, wherever
possible. All even numbers shall be placed upon houses and buildings on the north side of
said streets, avenues, alleys and highways, and all odd numbers shall be placed upon houses
and buildings on the south side of the streets, avenues, alleys, and highways.
State Street from the east City limits to the west City limits shall constitute the east and west
base line from which the numbers on all streets running north and south from said street shall
be extended each way, upon the basis of one number for approximately each 15 feet of
property frontage, wherever possible, starting at the base line with number 100 and
continuing with consecutive hundreds at each intersection, wherever possible. All even
numbers shall be placed upon houses and buildings on the east side of said streets, avenues,
alleys and highways, and all odd numbers shall be placed upon houses and buildings on the
west side of said streets, avenues, alleys and highways.
Assigning and placing of numbers. A survey has been made and numbers have been assigned to
each house and building located on any street, avenue, alley or highway in said City under a
uniform system provided for in Subsection A. The City Clerk shall notify the owner, occupant, or
agent of each house or building of the respective number assigned to it. Such owner, agent or
occupant shall call for such number at the office of the City Clerk and shall place such number or
numbers within 15 days after receipt of such notification. The cost of the number or numbers shall

1583(2)]
§ 274-13. Findings and purpose.
The City finds that excavation and occupancy within public rights-of-way causes direct and indirect
costs to be borne by the City and its taxpayers, including but not limited to:
Administrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as application,
permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials.
Repair and maintenance costs to the roadway associated with the actual intrusion into the
public right-of-way.
The purpose of this article is to provide the City legal framework within which to regulate and
manage the public rights-of-way and to provide for recovery of the costs incurred in regulating and

managing intrusions in the public rights-of-way.
This article provides for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City as they use the
rights-of-way of the City, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of the public rights-of-way. The
City desires to minimize the number of excavations taking place thereon and to regulate the
placement of facilities within the rights-of-way to ensure that they remain available for public
services. The taxpayers of the City bear the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way. A
primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is the frequent
excavation by persons who locate facilities therein.
§ 274-14. Administration.
The Department of Public Works (DPW) is responsible for the administration of the rights-of-way and
the permits and ordinances related thereto.
§ 274-15. Permit and registration required.
Each person who occupies, uses, or seeks to occupy or use the right-of-way or any equipment in
the right-of-way or has or seeks to have equipment located in any right-of-way shall obtain a rightof-
way permit from the DPW.
No person shall occupy, construct, install, repair, remove, relocate, or perform any other work on,
or use any equipment or any part thereof in, any right-of-way without first being registered with the
DPW.
No person may place a dumpster, container or similar removable storage container, or any
construction vehicle, on or in the public right-of-way without a permit from the Department of
Public Works (DPW); or allow a dumpster, container or similar removable storage container, or a
construction vehicle, to remain on or in the public right-of-way between November 15 and March
15. No person may allow a dumpster, container or similar removable storage container, or a
construction vehicle, to remain on or in the public right-of-way for a period longer than three
continuous calendar weeks between March 16 and November 14. Only rubber-tired construction
vehicles will be permitted. No person may obtain a right-of-way permit without providing a
certificate of insurance to the City indemnifying the City and holding the City harmless from any
and all liability for placement of the dumpster or construction vehicle. When emergency
circumstances are shown by an applicant, the City may permit the placement of a dumpster,
container or similar removable storage container, or any construction vehicle, on or in the public
right-of-way between November 15 and March 15 for a period not to exceed three continuous
calendar weeks, weather and circumstances permitting. Emergency placement permits may be
revoked due to weather conditions and snowplowing operations with forty-eight-our notice to the
permittee.

§ 274-16. Registration information.
The information provided to the DPW at the time of application shall include but not be limited to:
Each applicant's name, address and e-mail address, if applicable, and telephone and
facsimile numbers.
The name, address and e-mail address, if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of
a local representative. The local representative or designee shall be available at all times.
Current information regarding how to contact the local representative in an emergency shall
be provided at the time of registration.

A certified check or cashier's check in the amount of $2,000, payable to the City of Burlington.
This check will be returned after the proper restoration of the right-of-way has been completed.
The applicant must inform the DPW when all restoration work has been completed and allow the

In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work and the
surrounding areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed before

it determines that proper restoration has been made per standards of the DPW.
Standards. The permittee shall perform repairs and restoration according to the specifications and

replaced and doweled in place as directed by the DPW. It shall then be overlaid with asphalt
pavement.
Curb. Tunneling of curb shall not be allowed. Curb must be removed and replaced if curb is
exposed in the trench. When replacing curb, it must be tied to existing curb with two driven
one-half-inch tie rods in the pan of the gutter, at both ends of the pour. No curb sections shall

to joint. Any sections of sidewalk which have been undermined as work progressed will also
be cut out and replaced with suitable backfill tamped prior to replacement. No applicants or
contractors shall park any vehicle and/or equipment on City sidewalks. Should damage be
observed after the work has been completed, the applicant shall be notified to perform the
repairs. Where sidewalk sections are removed at street corners, the sidewalk and adjacent
curb shall be restored as directed by the DPW.
Aprons. Driveway aprons shall not be patched but rather reconstructed following right-of-way
work (particularly utility work). The applicant shall notify the DPW when a concrete apron will
be disturbed. All edges of the concrete restoration shall be saw cut, and the property owner's
access shall not be unreasonably denied. In the event a repair becomes necessary, an apron
will be repaired with the same material from which it was made.
Driveway openings. When creating new or widening existing driveway approaches, the curb
openings shall be created by one of two methods: the entire curb and gutter section shall be
removed and replaced, as stated above, or back of curb shall be horizontally sawed off.

entire curb and gutter section shall be removed and properly replaced, as stated above.
Parkway restoration. All excavations in areas of rights-of-way which are not paved shall be
backfilled with granular material compacted in twelve-inch lifts with mechanical compaction
equipment. The granular material shall be placed to within four inches of the finished grade,

Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the
condition required by the DPW or fails to complete satisfactorily and timely all restoration required
by the DPW, the DPW at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the
City, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If the bill is not paid by the
permittee, future permits may be refused according to § 274-24.
§ 274-22. Inspection.
Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is completed, the permittee shall
notify the DPW.
Site inspection. The permittee shall make the work site available to the DPW and to all others as
authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon
completion of the work.
Authority of DPW. At the time of inspection the City may order the immediate cessation of any
work which poses a threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. The City may issue
an order to the applicant for any work which does not conform to the applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. Within 10 days after issuance of the order, the applicant shall present
proof to the DPW that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented
within the required time, the DPW may revoke the permit.
§ 274-23. Other obligations.
Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a permit to work in the right-of-way does not relieve the
permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all
fees required by any other City, county, state, or federal rules, laws or regulations. A permittee
shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws. A permittee shall perform all
work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations and is
responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the
work.
Special permission required. Special permission is required from the City of Burlington Common
Council to move or to cause to be removed any building upon, within, along, over or across any
street, sidewalk, alley, or other public ground.[1]

to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, its officers, boards, committees, commissions,
elected officials, employees and agents from and against all loss or expense (including liability
costs and attorneys' fees) by reason of any claim or suit or of liability imposed by law upon the

reserved by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or component
and as set forth in Article VII of this chapter.
Parks and playgrounds. Whenever a tract of land to be divided within the jurisdiction of this
chapter encompasses all or any part of a park or playground which has been designated on a duly
adopted City or regional comprehensive plan or comprehensive plan component, said park or
playground shall be made a part of that plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the
locations and dimensions indicated on said plan and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in § 278-51 of this chapter.
§ 278-10. Improvements.
Before final approval of any plat located within the jurisdictional limits of this chapter, the subdivider
shall install street and utility improvements as hereinafter provided. If such improvements are not
installed as required at the time that the final plat is submitted for approval, the subdivider shall, before
the recording of the plat, enter into a contract with the City agreeing to install the required
improvements and shall file with said contract a bond or letter of credit meeting the approval of the City
Attorney or a certified check in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvements, said
estimate to be made by the Common Council after review and recommendation by the City Engineer,
as a guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or his subcontractors not
later than two years from the date of recording of the plat and as a further guarantee that all obligations
to subcontractors for work on the development are satisfied. In addition:
Contracts and contract specifications for the construction of street and utility improvements on
dedicated street rights-of-way as well as the contractors and subcontractors providing such work
shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
Governmental units to which these bond and contract provisions apply may file, in lieu of said
contract and bond, a letter from officers authorized to act on their behalf agreeing to comply with
the provisions of this section.

corporate limits of the City but within the plat approval jurisdiction of the City, the subdivider shall
give evidence that he has complied with all street and utility requirements of the town in which the
land being platted is located.

jurisdictional limits, the subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the
requirements of § 236.15, Wis. Stats., and as may be required by the City Engineer.
§ 278-11. Variances.
Where, in the judgment of the City Plan Commission, it would be inappropriate to apply literally the
provisions of Articles VII and VIII of this chapter because of the proposed subdivision being located
outside of the corporate limits or because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the City Plan
Commission may waive or modify any requirement to the extent deemed just and proper.
No variance to the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless the City Plan Commission
finds by the greater weight of the evidence that all the following facts and conditions exist and so
indicates in the minutes of its proceedings:
Exceptional circumstances. There are exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or
conditions where a literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would result in
severe hardship. (Such hardships should not apply generally to other properties or be of such
a recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed.)

Preservation of property rights. Such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same vicinity.
Absence of detriment. The variance will not create substantial detriment to adjacent property
and will not materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the
public interest.
A majority vote of the entire membership of the City Plan Commission shall be required to grant
any modification of this chapter.
The Common Council may waive the placing of monuments, required under § 236.15(1)(b), (c)
and (d), Wis. Stats., for a reasonable time on condition that the subdivider execute a surety bond
to insure the placing of such monuments within the required time limits established by the City.
§ 278-12. Land suitability.
No land shall be subdivided for residential use which is determined to be unsuitable for such use by
the Plan Commission for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation,
unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the
future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the City.
In addition:
Floodlands.
No lot served by public sanitary sewer facilities shall have less than 50% of its required
lot area below an elevation at least two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year
recurrence interval flood. No lot one acre or less in area served by an on-site sanitary
sewage disposal (septic tank) system shall include floodlands. All lots more than one
acre in area served by a septic tank system shall contain not less than 40,000 square
feet of land which is above flood protection elevation at least two feet above the elevation
of the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood or, where such data is not available,
five feet above the maximum flood of record.

[Added 11-9-2006 by Ord. No. 1808(12)]
The applicant shall provide all survey data and computations required to show the
effects of the project on flood heights, velocities and floodplain storage, for all
subdivision proposals, as "subdivision" is defined in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., and other
proposed developments exceeding five acres in area or where the estimated cost
exceeds $125,000. The applicant shall provide:
An analysis of the effect of the development on the regional flood profile,
velocity of flow and floodplain storage capacity;
A map showing location and details of vehicular access to lands outside the
floodplain; and
A surface drainage plan showing how flood damage will be minimized.
The estimated cost of the proposal shall include all structural development,
landscaping, access and road development, utilities, and other pertinent items, but
need not include land costs.

Commission shall refer the development to the DNR for review and recommendation
prior to recommendation to the Common Council.

Article III. Land Division Procedure
§ 278-16. Preliminary consultation.
It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat, the
subdivider consult with the City Plan Commission and/or its staff in order to obtain their advice and
assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory but is intended to inform the subdivider of
the purpose and objectives of this chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Plan
components, neighborhood plans, and duly adopted plan implementation devices of the City and to
otherwise assist the subdivider in planning his development. In so doing, both the subdivider and
planning agency may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the
proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider
will gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures.
§ 278-17. Preliminary plat review.
Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and a letter of
application. The preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter, and the subdivider
shall file an adequate number of copies of the plat and the application with the City Clerk together with
all necessary fees at least 15 days prior to the meeting of the City Plan Commission at which first
consideration is desired. In addition:
The Clerk or the subdivider shall distribute the preliminary plat for review as required by §§ 236.10
to 236.12, Wis. Stats. The Wisconsin Department of Administration, Department of Transportation
and Department of Commerce shall hereafter be referred to as "objecting agencies."[1]
The preliminary plat shall be distributed as follows:
Four copies to the County Planning Department.
Two copies to the Wisconsin Department of Administration, with additional copies for
each state agency required to review the plat for retransmission to those agencies as
follows:
Two copies to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation if the subdivision abuts or
adjoins a state trunk highway, as required by Chapter Trans 233, Wis. Admin. Code.
Two copies to the Department of Commerce if the subdivision is not served by a
public sewer and provision for such service has not been made.

Copies as required by the City Engineer to the Plan Commission.
In addition, any appropriate fees paid by the subdivider for the required state agency reviews
shall be forwarded by the City Clerk to the Department of Administration if the subdivider does
not submit the preliminary plat directly to the Department of Administration.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The City Clerk shall also transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to all affected City boards,
commissions or departments, the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, school
districts and all affected local utility companies for their review and recommendations concerning
matters within their jurisdiction. Their recommendations shall be transmitted to the City Plan
Commission within 30 days from the date the plat is filed. The preliminary plat shall then be
reviewed by the City Plan Commission for conformance with this chapter and all ordinances, rules,
regulations, comprehensive plans and comprehensive plan components, and neighborhood plans.
§ 278-18. Preliminary plat approval.
The objecting agencies shall, within 20 days of the date of receiving their copies of the preliminary plat,
notify the subdivider and all other approving and objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no
objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy of the plat and shall return that copy to the City
Clerk. If an objecting agency fails to act within 20 days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the
plat. In addition:
The City Plan Commission shall, within 90 days of the date of filing of a preliminary plat with the
City Clerk, approve, approve conditionally, or reject such plat. One copy of the plat shall thereupon
be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon, and, if approved
conditionally or rejected, a letter setting forth the conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection
shall accompany the plat. One copy each of the plat and letter shall be placed in the City Plan
Commission's permanent file.
Failure of the City Plan Commission to act within 90 days shall constitute an approval of the plat
as filed.
Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the
final plat, except that if the final plat is submitted within six months of preliminary plat approval and

Maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the exterior boundaries of the
subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance or position, the ratio of one part in 10,000 nor,
in azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field measurements exceed this maximum,
new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure is obtained. When a
satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained, the survey of the exterior
boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure.
All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed geometric figures based upon the
control provided by the closed exterior boundary survey. If field checks disclose an error for any
interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of one part in 5,000 or an error in measured angle
greater than one minute of arc for any angle where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet
or longer, necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a measured angle is
less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the
quotient of 300 divided by the length of the shorter side; however, such error shall not in any case
exceed five minutes of arc.

component, or neighborhood unit development plan of the City of Burlington, Wisconsin. In areas for
which such plans have not been completed, the street layout shall recognize the functional
classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to
existing and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth,
to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, and to
the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The subdivision shall be designed so as to
provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street. In addition:
Arterial streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of
employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation,
and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with
and related to the existing and proposed system of major streets and highways and shall be,
insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they
are to connect.
Collector streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic
from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system and
shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as
schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the major
streets to which they connect.
Minor streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage
use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and
to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting
property.
Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented
by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the City Plan Commission,
such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or
for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts.
Arterial street and highway protection. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent
to a major street or highway, adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access and
separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, with screen planting

§ 278-44. Limited access highway and railroad right-of-way
treatment.
Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway or railroad
right-of-way, the design shall provide the following treatment:
When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-of-way of an existing or proposed
limited access highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth shall be provided
adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth. This strip shall be a part of

the platted lots but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip
reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs; the building of structures hereon is prohibited."
Commercial and industrial properties shall have provided, on each side of the limited access
highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway
or railroad for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but
not less than 150 feet.
Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting a major
street and highway or collector street which crosses said railroad or highway, shall be located at a
minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where
desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
Minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided, and
location of minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to arterial streets and highways and to
railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas.
§ 278-45. Streets, alleys and pedestrianways.
The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all proposed streets and alleys shall be as specified
by the Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Plan component, Official Map, neighborhood
development study, or jurisdictional highway system plan, or, if no width is specified therein, the
minimum widths shall be as shown in Table 1.[1] Street sections are for standard arterial streets only.
Cross sections for freeways, expressways and parkways should be based upon detailed engineering
studies. In addition:
Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall not exceed 750 feet in
length. All cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently closed without a center
planting island shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 60
feet and a minimum outside curb radius of 46 feet, and all cul-de-sac streets designed to have one
end permanently closed with a center planting island shall terminate in a circular turnaround
having a minimum right-of-way radius of 75 feet and a minimum outside curb radius of 63 feet.
Temporary termination of streets intended to be extended at a later date shall be accomplished
with a temporary cul-de-sac in accordance with the standards set forth above or by construction of
a temporary "T" intersection 33 feet in width and 33 feet in length abutting the right-of-way lines of
the access street on each side.
Roadway elevations. Elevations of roadways passing through floodplain areas shall be designed
in the following manner:
Freeways shall be designed so they will not be overtopped by the one-hundred-year
recurrence interval flood.
Arterial highways shall be designed so they will not be overtopped by the fifty-year recurrence
interval flood.
Collectors and local streets shall be designed so they will not be overtopped by the ten-year
recurrence interval flood.
New and replacement bridges and culverts.
All new and replacement bridges and culverts over perennial waterways, including pedestrian
and other minor bridges, in addition to meeting other applicable requirements, shall be
designed so as to accommodate the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood event without
raising the peak stage, either upstream or downstream, more than 0.1 foot above the peak

stage for the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood, as established in the adopted
comprehensive watershed plan. Larger permissible flood stage increases may be acceptable
for reaches having topographic land use conditions which could accommodate the increased
stage without creating additional flood damage potential upstream or downstream of the
proposed structure. Such bridges and culverts shall be so designed and constructed as to
facilitate the passage of ice flows and other debris.
All new and replacement bridges shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable state
statutes and codes and shall be submitted to the Department of Natural Resources to assure
compliance therewith.
Street grades.
Unless necessitated by exceptional topography, subject to the approval of the Plan
Commission, the maximum center-line grade of any street or public way shall not exceed the
following:
Arterial streets: 6%.
Collector streets: 8%.
Minor streets, alleys and frontage streets: 10%.
Pedestrianways: 12% unless steps or stairs of acceptable design are provided.
The grade of any street shall in no case exceed 12% or be less than 1/2 of 1%.
Street grades may be varied as provided for in § 278-11 of this chapter, but in no case shall
any street grade be permitted to exceed 12%.
Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to avoid excessive grading, the
promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth, and general leveling of the
topography. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum
length equivalent in feet to 15 times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade for arterial
streets and 1/2 this minimum for all other streets.
Radii of curvature.
When a continuous street center line deflects at any one point by more than 10º, a circular
curve shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on said center line of not less than the
following:
Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet.
Collector streets: 300 feet.
Minor streets: 100 feet.
A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and
collector streets.
Half streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half street is adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of new
half streets shall not be permitted.
Cross sections. Typical street cross sections are attached to and made a part of this chapter.[2]

§ 278-46. Street intersections.
Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of
good design permit. In addition:
The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably
not more than two.
The number of intersections along major streets and highways shall be held to a minimum.
Wherever practicable the distance between such intersections shall not be less than 1,200 feet.
Property lines at street intersections may be rounded with a minimum radius of 15 feet or of a
greater radius when required by the City Plan Commission or shall be cut off by a straight line
through the points of tangency of an arc having a radius of 15 feet.
Minor streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or collector streets, but if the center
lines of such minor streets approach the major streets from opposite sides within 250 feet of each
other, measured along the center line of the arterial or collector street, then the location shall be so
adjusted that the adjoinment across the major or collector street is continuous and a jog is
avoided.
§ 278-47. Blocks.
The widths, lengths, and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land, zoning
requirements, need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic, and the limitations and
opportunities of topography. In addition:
The length of blocks in residential areas shall not as a general rule be less than 600 feet nor more
than 1,500 feet unless otherwise dictated by exceptional topography or other limiting factors of
good design.
Pedestrianways of not less than 10 feet in width may be required near the center and entirely
across any block over 900 feet in length where deemed essential by the City Plan Commission to
provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers, churches
or transportation facilities.
The width of blocks shall be wide enough to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth
except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic. The
width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to
provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and the area zoning
restrictions for such use.
Utility easements for electric power and telephone service shall, where practical, be placed on
midblock easements along rear lot lines.
§ 278-48. Lots.
The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for
the type of development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide an
aesthetically pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting for the building contemplated. In
addition:

Side lot lines shall be as nearly to right angles as possible to straight street lines or radial to
curved street lines on which the lots face. Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary lines rather
than cross them.
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where necessary to provide
separation of residential development from through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages
of topography and orientation.
Access. Every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at least 40 feet on a public street.
Area and dimensions of all lots shall conform to the requirements of Chapter 315, Zoning, of this
Code for the subdivisions within the City and to the applicable town or county zoning ordinance
within the City's extraterritorial jurisdictional limits. Those building sites not served by a public
sanitary sewerage system or other approved system shall be sufficient to permit the use of an onsite
soil absorption sewage disposal system designed in accordance with Ch. Comm 83, Wis.
Admin. Code. The width and area of lots located on soils suitable for the use of an on-site soil
absorption sewage disposal system shall not be less than 150 feet in width and 40,000 square
feet in area.
Depth of lots shall be a minimum of 125 feet. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided,
and a proportion of 2:1 shall be considered a desirable ratio under normal conditions. Depth of lots
or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for offstreet
service and parking required by the use contemplated.
Width of lots shall conform to the requirements of Chapter 315, Zoning, or other applicable
ordinance, and in no case shall a lot be less than 60 feet in width at the building setback line.
Corner lots shall have an extra width of 10 feet to permit adequate building setbacks from side
streets.
Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise unplattable lands
which lie between a proposed subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots,
outlots or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream.
§ 278-49. Building setback lines.
Building setback lines appropriate to the location and type of development contemplated which are
more restrictive than the regulation of the zoning district in which the plat is located may be required by
the City Plan Commission.
§ 278-50. Easements.
The City Plan Commission may require utility easements of widths deemed adequate for the intended
purpose on each side of all rear lot lines and on side lot lines or across lots where necessary or
advisable for electric power and communication lines, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, and
gas, water and other utility lines. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway
channel or stream, an adequate drainageway or easement shall be provided as may be required by
the City Plan Commission. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway or
easement shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer, and parallel streets or parkways may
be required in connection therewith. Where necessary, stormwater drainage shall be maintained by
landscaped open channels of adequate size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum
potential volumes of flow. These design details are subject to review and approval by the City
Engineer.
§ 278-51. Public sites and open spaces.

In the design of the plat, due consideration shall be given to the reservation of suitable sites of
adequate area for future schools, parks, playgrounds, drainageways and other public purposes. If
designated on the Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Plan component, Official Map, or
component neighborhood development plan, such areas shall be made a part of the plat as
stipulated in § 278-9 of this chapter. If not so designated, consideration shall be given in the
location of such sites to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of fine trees, marshes,
lakes and ponds, watercourses, watersheds and ravines.
Accordingly, each subdivider of land in the City of Burlington and extraterritorial plat jurisdiction
area shall, at the discretion and direction of the City Plan Commission, either dedicate open space
lands designated on the City Comprehensive Plan or plan component, or reserve such open
space lands and pay a public site fee, or, where no open space lands are directly involved, pay a
public site fee. The City Plan Commission shall, at the time of reviewing the preliminary plat or
certified survey map, select one of the following options and record such selection in the minutes
of the meeting at which the preliminary plat is presented for approval:
Dedication of site option. Whenever a proposed playground, park, or other public open space
land designated on the City's Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood unit development plan, or
other Comprehensive Plan component is encompassed, all or in part, within a tract of land to
be subdivided, the public lands shall be made a part of the plat and shall be dedicated to the
public by the subdivider at the rate of one acre for each 100 proposed or potential dwelling
units, and any such proposed public lands in excess of the rate established herein shall be
reserved for a period not to exceed three years, unless extended by mutual agreement, for
purchase by the public agency having jurisdiction at undeveloped land prices. If the lands in
excess of the established rate are not acquired within the three-year period as set forth
herein, the land will be released from reservation to the owner.
Reservation of site option. Whenever a proposed playground, park, or other public open
space land designated on the City's Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood unit development
plan, or other Comprehensive Plan component is encompassed, all or in part, within a tract of
land to be subdivided, the proposed public open space lands shall be made a part of the plat
and reserved at the time of final plat approval for a period not to exceed three years, unless
extended by mutual agreement, for acquisition at undeveloped land prices by the public
agency having jurisdiction, and the subdivider shall pay a public site fee at the time of
application for final plat approval at the rate and according to the procedures set forth in
Subsection B(3) of this section. If the land is not acquired within the three-year time period as
set forth herein, the land will be released to the owner from reservation.
Public site fee option. If the proposed subdivision does not encompass a proposed public
park, parkway, or other open space lands, or if the City Plan Commission requires the
reservation of land as set forth in Subsection B(2) of this section, a fee for the acquisition of
public sites to serve the future inhabitants of the proposed subdivision shall be paid to the City
Clerk at the time of first application for approval of a final plat of said subdivision or part
thereof in the amount as set by the Common Council for each proposed dwelling unit within
the plat. Public site fees collected by the City Treasurer under the provisions of this chapter
shall be placed in a nonlapsing special fund for City parks and shall be separate from the
general fund of the City, and said special fund shall be used exclusively for the acquisition
and development of park, recreation, and other open space areas within the neighborhood in
which the subdivision is located.
Article VIII. Required Improvements
§ 278-52. Survey monuments.
The subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of

§ 278-53. Grading.
After the installation of temporary block corner monuments by the subdivider and establishment of
street grades by the City Engineer, the subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all
streets proposed to be dedicated in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by
the City Engineer. The subdivider shall grade the roadbeds in the street rights-of-way to subgrade. Cut
and filled lands shall be graded to a maximum slope of one to four or the soil's angle of repose,
whichever is the lesser, and covered with permanent vegetation.
§ 278-54. Surfacing.
After the installation of all utility and stormwater drainage improvements, the subdivider shall surface
all roadways in streets proposed to be dedicated to the widths prescribed by this chapter and the
Comprehensive Plan or Comprehensive Plan components of the City. Said surfacing shall be done in
accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer.
§ 278-55. Curb and gutter.
[Amended 4-7-1993 by Ord. No. 1419(35)]
In all urban subdivisions and minor land divisions as defined herein, the Common Council shall require
the subdivider to construct concrete curbs and gutters in accordance with plans and standard
specifications approved by the City Engineer. Wherever possible, provision shall be made at the time
of construction for driveway access curb cuts. The cost of installation of all inside curbs and gutters for
dual roadway pavements on the established arterial street and highway system for the City shall be
borne by the City. In subdivisions and minor land divisions as defined herein, upon the determination
and recommendation of the Planning Commission that said subdivision or minor land division may
more appropriately consist of permanent rural-type street sections, the Common Council may waive
the requirement for the subdivider to construct concrete curbs and gutters.
§ 278-56. Rural street sections.
[Amended 4-7-1993 by Ord. No. 1419(35)]
When permanent rural street sections have been recommended for approval by the Plan Commission
and approved by the Common Council, the subdivider shall finish grade all shoulders and road ditches,
install all necessary culverts at driveways, intersections, and other locations where deemed necessary
and, if required, surface ditch inverts to prevent erosion and sedimentation in accordance with plans
and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer and as set forth in § 278-66 of this chapter.
§ 278-57. Sidewalks.
In all urban subdivisions and minor land divisions, the Common Council shall require the
subdivider to construct a concrete sidewalk on one side of all frontage streets and on both sides of
all other through and/or continuous streets within the subdivision. The Common Council may also
require the subdivider to construct concrete sidewalks on one or both sides of all streets restricting
through traffic or cul-de-sac streets which are in excess of 600 feet in length or which serve twofamily
or multiple-family development. The construction of all sidewalks shall be in accordance
with plans and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer.

of such permanent materials as may be appropriate to the character of the subdivision on one side
of all streets and culs-de-sac within the subdivision. The construction of such sidewalks shall be in
accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer.
[Amended 4-7-1993 by Ord. No. 1419(35)]
In addition, wider than standard sidewalks may be required by the Common Council in the vicinity
of schools, commercial areas, and other places of public assemblage, and the Common Council
may require the construction of sidewalks in locations other than required under the preceding
provisions of this chapter if such walks are necessary in its opinion for safe and adequate
pedestrian circulation.
§ 278-58. Bicycle paths and trails.
The subdivider shall install required bicycle paths and trails in accordance with the plans and
specifications approved by the City. The subdivider shall assume the entire cost of such bicycle paths
and trails except in the case of dual bicycle paths and streets. The added cost for streets wider than
those required by Table 1[1] in order to accommodate bicycle paths and trails shall be the responsibility
of the municipality charged with the maintenance of the proposed facility. In the event the subdivider
wishes to install dual lane facilities, which may not be required by the City, the total cost of such
improvements shall be borne by the subdivider.
Editor's Note: Table 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 278-59. Public sanitary sewerage.
When public sanitary sewerage facilities are available to the subdivision plat or minor land division, the
subdivider shall construct sanitary sewerage facilities in such a manner as to make adequate sanitary
sewerage service available to each lot within the subdivision or minor land division. In addition:
The Common Council shall require the installation of sewer laterals to the street lot line.
The size, type, and installation of all sanitary sewers and sanitary sewer laterals proposed to be
constructed shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the City
Engineer.
The subdivider shall assume the cost of installing all sanitary sewers eight inches in diameter or
less in size. If greater than eight-inch diameter sewers are required to handle the contemplated
sewage flows, the costs of such larger sewers shall be prorated in proportion to the ratio which the
total area of the proposed subdivision or certified survey map is to the total drainage area to be
served by such larger sewer and the excess cost either borne by the City or assessed against the
total tributary drainage area.
The subdivider shall install sanitary sewers in accordance with this Code and specifications of the
City Engineer when it is determined that the proposed subdivision or minor land division lies within
a public sanitary sewer service area and sanitary sewer facilities are programmed to be extended
to the proposed subdivision or minor land division within six years. Until such time as the public
sewers within the subdivision or minor land division can be connected to the community public
sewer system, they shall be temporarily capped. No private or public use shall be connected to the
sewers within the subdivision or minor land division until such sewers are connected to the larger
community system. The subdivider shall indicate on the face of the plat or certified survey map
that the owners of private uses within the subdivision or minor land division shall connect such
uses to the sewers in the subdivision or minor land division at the time such sewers are connected
to the community sewer system and that the City is held harmless for any damages or costs
incurred to disconnect and abandon any on-site sanitary sewer disposal system then in place and
any costs associated with connection to the public sewer mains.

§ 278-61. Water supply facilities.
When public water supply and distribution facilities are available to the subdivision plat or minor land
division or when it is proposed to establish a private water supply and distribution system to serve two
or more lots, the subdivider shall cause such water supply and distribution facilities to be installed in
such a manner as to make adequate water service available to each lot within the subdivision or minor
land division. The subdivider shall make provision for adequate private water systems as required by
the City in accordance with the standards of the Wisconsin Department of Commerce. In addition:
The Common Council may require the installation of water laterals to the street lot line.
The size, type, and installation of all public water mains proposed to be constructed shall be in
accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the Common Council.
The subdivider shall assume the cost of installing all water mains, water laterals, and water
system appurtenances within the proposed subdivision or minor land division except for the added
cost of installing water mains greater than eight inches in diameter.
The subdivider shall install water mains in accordance with this Code and specifications of the City
Engineer when it is determined that the proposed subdivision or minor land division lies within a
public sanitary sewer service area and water main facilities are programmed to be extended to the
proposed subdivision within six years. Until such time as the public water mains within the
subdivision or minor land division can be connected to the larger community water supply system,
they shall be temporarily capped. No private or public use shall be connected to the water mains
within the subdivision or minor land division until such water mains are connected to the larger
community water supply system. The subdivider shall indicate on the face of the plat that the
owners of private uses within the subdivision or minor land division shall connect such uses to the
water mains within the subdivision or minor land division and that the City is held harmless for any
damages or costs incurred to disconnect and abandon any on-site water supply system then in
place and any costs associated with connection to the public water mains.
Editor's Note: See also Ch. 304, Water.
§ 278-62. Other utilities.
The subdivider shall cause appropriate utilities such as gas, electrical power, cable television, and
telephone facilities to be installed in such a manner as to make adequate service available to each lot
in the subdivision or minor land division. No such electrical, cable television, or telephone service shall
be located on overhead poles. In addition, plans indicating the proposed location of all gas, electrical
power and telephone distribution and transmission lines required to service the plat shall be approved
by the City Engineer.

lamps shall be placed at each street intersection and at such interior block spacing as may be required
by the City Engineer.
§ 278-64. Street signs.
The subdivider shall install, at the intersection of all streets proposed to be dedicated, a street sign of a
design as approved by the City Engineer.
§ 278-65. Street trees.
In all urban subdivisions or minor land divisions, the subdivider shall plant at least one tree of an
approved species and of at least 10 feet in height for each 50 feet of frontage on all streets proposed
to be dedicated. Tree planting shall be completed in accordance with any neighborhood plan, or
component thereof, and with plans and specifications approved by and at such time as directed by the
Park Board. The placement and selection of street trees, however, should not hamper or interfere with
solar access to natural light and air for nearby lots. In lieu of planting street trees, the subdivider may
pay a tree fee as set by the Common Council. The Park Board shall use the tree fee to plant trees in
the subdivision or minor land division subsequent to approval of the final plat.
§ 278-66. Sediment control.
The subdivider shall plant those grasses, trees, and vines, of a species and size specified by the
Common Council, necessary to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation. In addition:
The Common Council may require the subdivider to provide or install certain protection and
rehabilitation measures, such as fencing, sloping, seeding, riprap, revetments, jetties, clearing,
dredging, snagging, drop structures, brush mats, willow poles, and grade stabilization structures.
Tree cutting and shrubbery clearing shall not exceed 30% of the lot or tract and shall be so
conducted as to prevent erosion and sedimentation, preserve and improve scenic qualities, and,
during foliation, substantially screen any development from stream or lake users.
Paths and trails in wooded and wetland areas shall not exceed 10 feet in width unless otherwise
approved by the City Plan Commission and shall be so designed and constructed as to result in
the least removal and disruption of trees and shrubs and the minimum impairment of natural
beauty.
Earthmoving, such as grading, topsoil removal, mineral extraction, stream course changing, road
cutting, waterway construction or enlargement, removal of stream or lake bed materials,
excavation, channel clearing, ditching, drain tile laying, dredging, and lagooning, shall be so
conducted as to prevent erosion and sedimentation and to least disturb the natural fauna, flora,
watercourse, water regimen, and topography. (See §§ 278-71 and 278-72 of this chapter.)
Review of the conduct of such cutting, clearing, and moving may be requested of the County Soil
and Water Conservation District Supervisors, the State District Fish and Game Managers, and the
State District Forester by the City Engineer or City Plan Commission as he or it deems
appropriate.
§ 278-67. Improvements extended to limit of parcel.
Any and all improvements or utility services required by this chapter for the subdivision and/or minor
land division of lands within the City or within the City's extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction shall be

§ 278-81.1. Park facilities impact fee.
[Added 4-8-2020 by Ord. No. 2057(23)]
Appropriateness and use of fee. The Common Council has determined that it is appropriate to
impose and use impact fees to pay for the capital costs for park facilities that are necessary to
accommodate new land development without decreasing current levels of service in the City. The
impact fees are being imposed in accordance with § 66.0617, Wis. Stats., and the needs
assessment and methodology set forth in the impact fee report for park improvement ("needs
assessment report") on file in the office of the City Clerk.
Payment of the park facilities impact fee. At the time of the submission to the City of an application
for the approval of a final plat for a residential subdivision, and/or a proposed final development
plan containing residential dwelling units, the applicant shall pay to the City the then-established
park facilities impact fee based on the number of residential dwelling units in the proposed
subdivision/plan (hereinafter referred to as the "proposal").
True-up. Upon the approval by the City of the final version of the proposal, the amount of the park
facilities impact fee shall be recalculated, based on the number of residential dwelling units in the
approved proposal. Within 30 days after the date of the final approval of the proposal by the City,
the parties shall make any required true-up payments between themselves, based on the fee
schedule in place at the time of the original fee payment.
Return of the payment. In the event the City fails to approve the proposal, or the submitter of the
proposal withdraws the proposal before approval of the same by the City, the City shall, within 30
days after a written request is made to the City by the submitter of the proposal for the return of
park facilities impact fee, the City shall pay to the payor of the fee the park facilities impact fee
originally paid to the City for the proposal.
§ 278-82. Tree fee.
If the subdivider does not plant street trees in the subdivision or minor land division as set forth in
§ 278-65 of this chapter, the Plan Commission shall require a fee for the acquisition and planting of
trees in the subdivision. Said fee shall be paid to the City Clerk at the time of first application for
approval of a final plat of said subdivision in the amount as set by the Common Council for each tree
that is required under § 278-65 of this chapter.
§ 278-83. Engineering fee.
The subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the actual cost to the City for all engineering work incurred by
the City in connection with the plat. In addition:
Engineering work shall include the preparation of construction plans and standard specifications.
The City Engineer may permit the subdivider to furnish all, some, or part of the required
construction plans and specifications, in which case no engineering fees shall be levied for such
plans and specifications.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall be used:
ALLEY
A special public way affording only secondary access to abutting properties.
ARTERIAL STREET
A street used or intended to be used primarily for fast or heavy through traffic. "Arterial street"
shall include freeways and expressways as well as standard arterial streets, highways and
parkways.
BLOCK
A tract of land bounded by streets or a combination of streets, public parks, cemeteries, railroad
rights-of-way, shorelines of navigable waters, and municipal boundaries.
BUILDING LINE
A line parallel to a lot line and at a distance from the lot line to comply with the terms of this
chapter.

9/15/2020 City of Burlington, WI Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/BU1954?guid=BU1954&children=true 420/675
A local street with only one outlet and having an appropriate turnaround for the safe and
convenient reversal of traffic movement.
DEVELOPMENT (RURAL)
Agricultural, residential, recreational and other open space development at such concentrations
and densities not requiring traditional urban services and facilities. Historically, in southeastern
Wisconsin, when residential development densities are less than 0.2 dwelling unit per gross acre
(or one dwelling unit per five acres), such traditional urban services are not required. Such rural
development may be expected to result in minimum disturbance of the land and land cover and
therefore less impact on the natural environment.
DEVELOPMENT (URBAN)
Residential, commercial, industrial, governmental and institutional development in sufficient
concentrations or densities to require a variety and high level of traditional urban services and
facilities, including but not limited to full- or part-time municipal police and fire protection and
community administration; additional public streets and highways; neighborhood parks and
playgrounds; neighborhood schools; local libraries; public sanitary sewer facilities, public water
supply facilities, and public solid waste removal; storm sewers; mass transit facilities; continual
street maintenance; curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; streetlighting; and neighborhood convenience
shopping. Such development may be expected to alter or require the altering of land and land
cover and have detrimental impact on the ground and surface waters. Historically, in southeastern
Wisconsin, urban development occurs when residential development is concentrated in densities
in excess of 0.2 dwelling unit per gross acre (or one dwelling unit per five acres).
EXTRATERRITORIAL PLAT APPROVAL JURISDICTION
The unincorporated area within 1 1/2 miles of a fourth-class city or a village and within three miles
of all other cities.
FLOODLANDS
Those lands, including the channels, floodways, and floodplain fringe of any given reach, which
are subject to inundation by a flood with a given recurrence frequency. The one-hundred-year
recurrence interval flood (or that flood having a one-percent probability of occurring in any given
year) is generally used for zoning regulation. Other flood events used in this chapter are the fiftyyear
recurrence interval flood (or that flood having a two-percent probability of occurring in any
given year) and the ten-year recurrence interval flood (or that flood having a ten-percent
probability of occurring in any given year). Where detailed flood data is not available, the
maximum flood of record is used.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION
An elevation two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood or,
where such data is not available, five feet above the maximum flood of record.
FRONTAGE STREET
A minor street auxiliary to and located on the side of an arterial street for control of access and for
service to the abutting development.
HIGH GROUNDWATER ELEVATION
The highest elevation to which subsurface water rises. This may be evidenced by the actual
presence of water during wet periods of the year or by soil mottling during dryer periods. "Mottling"
is a mixture or variation of soil colors. In soils with restricted internal drainage, gray, yellow, red,
and brown colors are intermingled, giving a multicolored effect.
HIGH-WATER ELEVATION (SURFACE WATER)
The average annual high-water level of a pond, stream, lake, flowage, or wetland referred to an
established datum plane or, where such elevation is not available, the elevation of the line up to
which the presence of the water is so frequent as to leave a distinct mark by erosion, change in or
destruction of vegetation or other easily recognized topographic, geologic, or vegetative
characteristic.

A lot abutting two or more streets at their intersection, provided that the corner of such intersection
shall have an angle of 135º or less, measured on the lot side.
LOT, DOUBLE FRONTAGE
A lot, other than a corner lot, with frontage on more than one street. Double frontage lots shall
normally be deemed to have two front yards and two side yards and no rear yard. Double frontage
lots shall not generally be permitted unless the lot abuts an arterial highway. Double frontage lots
abutting arterial highways should restrict direct access to the arterial highway by means of a
planting buffer or some other acceptable access buffering measure.
MINOR LAND DIVISION

not been reclaimed pursuant to Subsection G(2). The towing agency shall have a lien on
the vehicle for the cost of towing and storage and may retain possession of the vehicle
until such charges are paid. If the value of the vehicle is $500 or less, the towing agency
may enforce the lien as set forth in § 779.415, Wis. Stats.
Storage, notice and reclaiming of abandoned and/or unregistered vehicles.
Storage and reclaiming. Any vehicle which is determined by the Police Department to be
abandoned and/or unregistered shall be retained in storage for a period of 14 days after the
Police Department sends a certified mail notice (with return receipt) to the owner and
lienholders of record. A fee in an amount set by the Common Council for storage of an
impounded vehicle shall be charged. Any such vehicle which may be lawfully reclaimed may
be released upon the payment of all accrued charges, including any forfeiture imposed for the
violation of this section, towing, storage, and notice charges, and upon presentation of the
vehicle title or other satisfactory evidence to the Police Department or the towing agency to
prove ownership or secured party interest in said vehicle. In the case of unregistered vehicles,
satisfactory evidence that the vehicle is currently registered, or that an application for
registration (including satisfactory emissions inspections) and the applicable fee has been
delivered or mailed to the Department of Motor Vehicles, or that the vehicle is exempt from
registration, must be presented.
Notice to owner or secured party. Certified mail notice, as referred to herein, shall be made by
the Police Department and shall notify the owner and lienholders of record of the following:
That the vehicle has been deemed abandoned or unregistered and impounded by the
City of Burlington, giving the year, make, model, and serial number of the vehicle and
where the vehicle is being held, and shall inform the owner and any lienholders of their
right to reclaim the vehicle.
The determined value of the vehicle.
If the cost of towing, storage and notice costs will exceed the determined value of the
vehicle.
That if the vehicle is not wanted for evidence or other reason, the vehicle may be
reclaimed upon the payment of all accrued charges, including towing, storage, and notice
charges, within 14 days of the date of notice.
That the failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their rights to reclaim the vehicle
under this section shall be deemed a waiver of all right, title, and interest in the vehicle
and a consent to the sale of the vehicle. Each retained vehicle not reclaimed by its owner
or lienholder may be disposed of under this section.
Disposal of abandoned and/or unregistered vehicles.
If the Police Department had the vehicle towed to the towing agency's impound lot, the
vehicle may be disposed of by the towing agency after it obtains title pursuant to its lien, as
set forth in Subsection F(2)(c), but only after storage for a period of 14 days after certified
mail notice, as provided in Subsection G(2), has been sent to the titled owner or secured
party of record, provided that it is determined that the vehicle is not reported stolen or wanted
for evidence or other reason, and provided further that the Police Department has notified the
agency that it has not been reclaimed.
Any vehicle impounded by the City which has not been reclaimed or disposed of pursuant to
the provisions of Subsection H(1) may be sold by public auction sale or public sale calling for
the receipt of sealed bids. A Class 1 notice, including the description of the vehicle, the
name(s) and address(es) of the titled owner and secured party of record, if known, and the
time of sale, shall be published before the sale. Any interested person may offer bids on each
vehicle to be sold. At such sale the highest bid for any such motor vehicle shall be accepted

all bids may be rejected. If all bids are rejected or no bid is received, the municipality may
either readvertise the sale, adjourn the sale to a definite date, sell the vehicle at a private sale
or junk the vehicle.
When any vehicle is to be sold pursuant to Subsection H(2), a public notice shall be posted at
the Police Department and at City Hall. The posting of the notice shall be in the same form as
the certified mail notice sent to the owner or lienholders of record. Any listing of vehicles to be
sold by the City shall be made available to any interested person or organization who or
which makes a written request for such list to the Chief of Police or his designee.
Upon sale of a vehicle pursuant to Subsection H(2), the City shall provide the purchaser with
a completed seized/abandoned/unregistered vehicle transfer certificate enabling the
purchaser to obtain a regular certificate of title for the vehicle.
The purchaser shall have 10 days to remove the vehicle from the storage area but shall pay
the storage fee set forth in Subsection G(1) for each day the vehicle remains in storage after
the second business day subsequent to the sale date. Ten days after the sale the purchaser
shall forfeit all interest in the vehicle and the vehicle shall be deemed to be abandoned and
may be sold again.
Report of sale or disposal. Within five days after the direct sale or disposal of a vehicle as
provided for herein, the Chief of Police or his designee shall advise the State of Wisconsin
Department of Transportation, Division of Motor Vehicles, of such sale or disposal on a form
supplied by said Division. A copy of the form shall be given to the purchaser of the vehicle
enabling the purchaser to obtain a regular certificate of title for the vehicle.
Owner responsible for impoundment and disposal costs.
The owner of any abandoned and/or unregistered vehicle is responsible for the ordinance
violation and all costs of impounding and disposing of the vehicle. Costs not covered from the
sale of the vehicle may be recovered in a civil action by the City against the owner.
Payment of removal and impoundment costs is not required when the vehicle has been
impounded for purposes of law enforcement investigation.
Penalties. Any person who shall violate any provisions of this section, or any order, rule or
regulation made hereunder, shall be subject to a penalty as provided in Chapter 1, § 1-4, of this
Municipal Code.

§ 304-3. Water main extensions.
[Amended 10-3-1989 by Ord. No. 1276(24)[1]]
Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
CONTRIBUTOR
The owner of property at time of a contribution or refund, unless otherwise specified by written
agreement.
CUSTOMER
The owner of premises to which water is now or is to be furnished, unless specific written
agreements specify otherwise. The customer at all times means the property owner at the
time a contribution is to be made or a refund becomes available.
Extension of existing water mains not otherwise subject to regulation by Chapter 278, Subdivision
of Land, of this Municipal Code shall be made upon the order of the Common Council or the Board
of Public Works only after said proposed extension has been referred to the Water Utility and the
approval of said Water Utility has been obtained.
All extensions of water mains shall be placed and laid along the property to be served in the front
yard of said property and to the farthest property line of said property by the shortest, most
reasonable route approved by the Water Utility. Said extensions may be laid when, in the opinion
of the Council, the Board of Public Works and the Water Utility, the number of consumers will
warrant the laying of necessary pipes to supply water service. If the water main is extended for the
development of a parcel, the developer of said parcel shall be responsible for and pay the cost of
extending the water main, except for oversizing, as may be paid for by the City or Water Utility.
The Water Utility shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the size of the extension, but
the Common Council shall remain vested with the sole power to contract for said extension
construction. The minimum size of water main extension where fire protection is needed shall be
eight inches. The size of other extensions shall be determined at the discretion of the Water Utility.
The expense of such extension shall be paid by the Water Utility and the same shall be levied as
an assessment equivalent to the lesser of either Water Utility estimate at the time of the hearing or

contract price for such extension of water mains, including street intersections, all main line valves
and such incidental administrative costs and engineering expenses as are attributable thereto.
Such assessment shall be determined according to the frontage of abutting properties benefited
thereby and located within the area and confines of the water main extension project, provided
that:
Where the cost of extension is to be immediately assessed against the abutting property, the
procedure set forth under § 66.0703, Wis. Stats., will apply.
Where the City or the Utility is unwilling to make a special assessment because of low density
of prospective consumers or for some other reason, extensions will be made on a customerfinanced
basis as follows:
Basis for determining contributions from original customer. The applicant (or applicants,
pro rata) will advance the amount that would have been assessed under Subsection D(1)
above. The contribution must be paid in advance of construction.
Additional customers and refunds.
When additional customers are connected to a water main that was originally
financed in part by customers, the Utility will require a contribution from each new
customer equal to the existing average contribution. When the amount of customer
contribution computed under this subsection is less than would have been assessed
under Subsection D(1) above, the applicant for service shall pay an amount
equivalent to the assessment. This amount shall then be refunded pro rata to all
contributors along the extension whose remaining contribution still exceeds what
would have been assessed under Subsection D(1) above.
When refunds have reduced the contribution of any contributor to the applicable
assessment per front foot, no further refund will be made to that individual. After all
refunds have been made, the remaining premises that may connect will be charged
at the rate per front foot established for the extension.
Limit of extension. When an extension beyond an existing extension is required to serve
a new customer and the cost for a customer exceeds the average remaining contribution
in the original extension, then the new extension will be considered as an entirely new
project, without funds or other connection with the original extension.
When customers connect to a transmission main or connecting loops laid at Utility expense,
there will be a contribution of an amount equivalent to the applicable assessment as
determined in Subsection D(1) above.
The development period during which refunds shall be made will be limited to 20 years.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 304-4. Maintenance and repairs.
The Water Utility may enter into contracts relating to the maintenance, repair, improvement and
operation of the Utility. This power, however, shall be exclusive of contracts involving new construction.
The Water Utility further reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily and to make
repairs or alterations to the system. When the circumstances will permit sufficient delay, the Utility shall
give notification by newspaper publication or otherwise of the interruption of the water supply. No
rebate or damages will be allowed to consumers for the temporary suspension of supply.
§ 304-5. Tapping mains.

water on any section of the main at any time, this right being expressly reserved to the Water Utility. No
service connection or other attachments to any of the water mains shall be made except by corporation
cock and in no case less in size than one inch in diameter, and copper pipe leads shall be connected
by what is known as a plumber's flared connection. Between the water main and the meter on all
service leads of two inches or less, copper type K pipe shall be used, and on all leads exceeding two
inches, a cast-iron three-inch or larger pipe shall be used, unless otherwise approved by the Utility
Manager.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 304-6. Installation of service lines and laterals.
Service lines and laterals extending from the main to the property line curb stopcock shall be installed
at the time of installation of the water main to eliminate the necessity for subsequent street openings.
The cost thereof shall be levied as a special assessment against the property served by such lateral at
the same time as the assessment for the installation of the water mains and shall be classified as "aid
to construction."
§ 304-7. Water service.
Establishment of service. Application for water service shall be made in writing on a form furnished
by the Water Utility. The application will contain the legal description of the property to be served,
name of the owner, the exact use to be made of the service, and the size of the supply pipe and
meter required. Size of pipe and meter required shall be established by the Water Utility. (Note
particularly any special refrigeration or air-conditioning water-consuming appliances.)

Premises have a frontage on a properly platted street or public strip in which a cast-iron
or other long-life water main has been laid or where the property owner has agreed to
and complied with the provisions of the Utility's filed main extension rule;
The property owner has installed or agrees to install a service pipe from the curbline to
the point of use, laid not less than six feet nor more than seven feet below the surface of
an established or proposed grade and according to the Utility's specifications; and
Premises have adequate piping beyond the metering point.
The owner of a multi-unit dwelling has the option of being served by individual metered water
service to each unit. The owner, by selecting this option, is required to provide interior
plumbing and meter settings to enable individual metered service to each unit and individual
disconnection without affecting service to other units. Each meter and meter connection will
be treated as a separate Water Utility customer for the purpose of the filed rules and
regulations. See also § 304-9B(2)(d).
No division of the water service of any lot or parcel of land shall be made for the extension
and independent meterage of the supply to an adjoining lot or parcel of land. Except for
duplexes, no division of a water supply service shall be made at the curb for separate
supplies therefrom for two or more separate premises having frontage on any street or public
service strip, whether owned by the same or different parties. Duplexes may be served by
one lateral, provided that individual metered service and disconnection is provided.
The Utility may withhold approval of any application wherein full information of the purpose of
such supply is not clearly indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner.

Service contract.
The minimum service contract period shall be one year unless otherwise specified by special
contract or in the applicable rate schedule. Where the Utility has disconnected service at the
customer's request prior to expiration of the minimum contract period, a reconnection charge
shall be made, payable in advance, when the customer requests reconnection of service. See
Schedule R-1 for applicable rate. The minimum contract period is renewed with each
reconnection.
A reconnection charge shall also be required from consumers whose services are
disconnected (shut off at curb stop box) because of nonpayment of bills when due (not
including disconnection for failure to comply with deposit or guarantee rules). See Schedule
R-1 for applicable rate.
A consumer shall be considered as the same consumer provided that the reconnection is
requested for the same location by any member of the same household or, if a place of
business, by any partner of the same business.
Temporary metered supply, meter and deposits. An applicant for temporary water supply on a
metered basis shall make and maintain a monetary deposit for each meter installed as security for
payment for use of water and for such other charges which may arise from the use of the supply.
A charge shall be made for setting the valve and furnishing and setting the meter. See Schedule
BW-1 for applicable rate.
Water for construction. When water is wanted for construction purposes or for filling tanks or other
such uses, an application therefor shall be made to the Utility Manager, in writing, upon application
provided for that purpose in the Water Utility office, giving a statement of the amount of
construction work to be done or the size of the tank to be filled or the volume required for such
other use. Payment for the water for construction shall be made in advance at the scheduled
rates. The service pipe must be carried inside the cellar wall from where the water must be drawn.
No connection with the service pipe at the curb shall be made without special permission from the
Utility Manager. In no case will any employee of the Utility turn on water for construction work
unless the contractor first presents a permit. Upon completion of the construction work, the
contractor must return the original permit to the Water Utility. Consumers shall not allow
contractors, masons, or other persons to take water from their premises without first showing a
permit from the Water Utility. Any consumer failing to comply with this provision will have his water
service discontinued. He shall be subject to a fine as set forth in § 304-14. See Schedule Mz-1 for
applicable rate.
Use of hydrants.
In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted by the Utility to use a
hydrant. No hydrant shall be used until it is equipped with a sprinkling valve. In no case shall
any valve be installed or moved except by a member of the Utility.
Before a valve is set, payment must be made for its setting and for the water to be used at the
scheduled rates. Where applicable, see Schedule BW-1 for deposits and charges. Upon
completing use of the hydrant, the customer must notify the Utility to that effect.
In the use of a hydrant supply, the hydrant valve will be set at the proper opening by the Utility
when the sprinkling valve is set, and the flow of water must be regulated by means of the
sprinkling valve. If the water is to be used through iron pipe connections, all such pipe
installations shall have the swing joint to facilitate quick disconnection from the fire hydrant.
Operation of valves and hydrants and unauthorized use of water; penalty. Any person who shall,
without authority of the Utility, allow contractors, masons or other unauthorized persons to take
water from their premises, operate any valve connected with the street or supply mains, or open
any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for the purpose of extinguishing

fire, or who shall wantonly damage or impair the same shall be subject to a fine as provided by
municipal ordinance. Permits for the use of hydrants apply only to such hydrants as are
designated for the specific use.
Refunds of monetary deposits. All monies deposited as security for payment of charges arising
from the use of temporary water supply on a metered basis, or for the return of a sprinkling valve
wheel or reducer, if the water is used on an unmetered basis, will be refunded to the depositor on
the termination of the use of water, the payment of all charges levied against the depositor and the
return of the wheel and reducer.
Service connections (or water laterals).
No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill or
any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless
adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be
approved by the Utility Manager. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall
be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing not less than twice
the diameter of the service connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or
pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient
material and made impervious to moisture. In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe
must be protected against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling, free from hard
lumps, rocks, stones or other injurious material, around and at least six inches over the pipe.
All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main into the point of meter
placement. One-inch type K copper shall be minimum and two-inch type K copper shall be
maximum copper. Larger service shall be of cast iron. All copper services shall be connected
by what is known as a plumber's flared connection. Beyond the meter outlet valve, the piping
shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution
of water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or appliances operating
simultaneously.
Replacement and repair of service pipe. The service pipe from the main to and through the curb
stop will be maintained and kept in repair and, when worn out, replaced at the expense of the
Utility. The property owner shall maintain the service pipe from the curb stop to the point of use
and can be billed for any water which has not passed through the meter and has been wasted by
leakage or defective pipes and fixtures, as estimated by the Utility Manager. If a consumer fails to
repair a leaking or broken service pipe from curb to point of metering or use within such time as
may appear reasonable to the Utility Manager after notification has been served on the consumer
by the Utility Manager, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs
have been completed.
Thawing frozen services. Frozen services shall be thawed out by and at the expense of the Utility
except where the freezing was caused by contributory fault or negligence on the part of the
consumer, such as reduction of the grade or undue exposure of the piping in the building or on the
consumer's property, or failure to comply with Water Utility specifications and requirements as to
depth of service, lack of sufficient backfill, etc. Following the freezing of a service, the Utility shall
take such steps and issue such instructions as may be necessary to prevent the refreezing of the
same service. No charge will be made for rethawings if the instructions are followed. In case it is
necessary to allow the water to flow to prevent refreezing the consumer must make provision for
proper disposal of the wastewater. For the period in which the water is allowed to run the
consumer will be billed according to his meter readings, but in no event to exceed the average
amount paid in the corresponding billing periods of the previous two years. A new consumer will
be charged the average bill for other consumers of the same class receiving service under
comparable conditions.
Stop boxes. Each service shall be furnished with a stop cock and metal extension box approved
by the Utility, easily accessible, and so situated below the action of frost that the water can be
completely shut off. All new or replacement installations shall be placed between the lot line and

the inner sidewalk or in the sidewalk at a depth not in excess of seven feet nor less than six feet
below the established grade. The customer shall protect the stop box free from dirt and other
obstruction. The Utility shall not be responsible for failure to locate a stop box and shut off the
water in case of a leak on the consumer's premises.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 304-8. Water meters.
Installation of meters. Meters will be furnished and placed by the Utility and are not to be
disconnected or tampered with by the consumer. The type and size of meters and service pipes
required shall be established by rule of the Water Utility. All meters shall be so located that they
shall be protected from obstructions and permit ready access thereto for reading, inspection, and
servicing, such location to be designated or approved by the Utility Manager. All piping within the
building must be supplied by the consumer. Where additional meters are desired by the consumer,
he shall pay for all piping and an additional amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance and
depreciation. Where applicable, see Schedule AM-1 for rate.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Repairs to meters. Meters will be repaired by the Water Utility and the cost of such repairs caused
by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the Utility. Repair of any damage to a meter resulting
from the carelessness of the owner of the premises, his agent, or tenant or from the negligence of
any one of them to properly secure and protect the same, including any damage that may result
from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be injured from the presence of hot water or
steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the consumer or the owner of the premises.
Service piping for meter settings. In installing new service piping (or changing service piping
where consumers have been on a flat rate), if meters are to be set, the consumer shall, at his
expense, provide the proper connections for the meter. The Utility Manager should be consulted
as to the type and size of meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or
other suitable place within the building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste
cock, then a union, and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached
to the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the Utility
Manager (he may require a horizontal run of 18 inches in such pipeline) which may later be
removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. Then a valve shall be installed on the
outlet side of the meter on the riser. The minimum setting of the meter shall be 18 inches above
the floor. No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Turning on water. The water cannot be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized
employee of the Utility. When a plumber has completed a job, he must leave the water turned off.
This does not prevent him from testing his work. No service line shall be backfilled without first
receiving an inspection by the Water Utility and written approval from the Water Utility.
Failure to read meters. Where the Utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts,
the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed or the
minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is,
the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of
the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill
paid the preceding month. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained from the customer
shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered. If the meter is damaged (see § 304-
9C, Surreptitious use of water) or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during
the past year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be
properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method.

Complaint meter tests. If a customer demands that a test be made of his or her meter, such test,
and any applicable fee therefor, shall conform to the requirements of § PSC 185.77, Wis. Admin.
Code. Where applicable, bills shall be adjusted pursuant to § PSC 185.35, Wis. Admin. Code.[3]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Inspection of premises. During reasonable hours any officer or authorized employee of the Utility
shall have the right of access to the premises supplied with service for the purpose of inspection
or for the enforcement of the Utility's rules and regulations. Whenever appropriate, the Utility will
make a systematic inspection of all unmetered water taps for the purpose of checking waste and
unnecessary use of water.[4]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 304-9. Administration and billing.
Computation of charges.
Unit of service (applicable only if provided for in the rate schedule). A unit of service shall
consist of any residential or small commercial aggregation of space or area occupied for a
distinct purpose, such as a residence, apartment, flat, store, or office, which is equipped with
one or more fixtures for rendering water service, separate and distinct from other users. Each
unit of service shall be regarded as one consumer and the surcharge for additional
consumers on a meter assessed accordingly. Suites in houses or apartments where complete
housekeeping functions (such as cooking) are not exercised shall be classed as rooming
houses. Thus, houses and apartments having suites of one, two, or more rooms with toilet
facilities, but without a kitchen for cooking, are classed as rooming houses. When a
consumer's premises has several buildings each supplied with service and metered
separately, the full service charge will be billed for each meter separately and the readings will
not be cumulated. If these buildings are all used in the same business and are connected by
the consumer they can be metered in one place. If the Utility, for its own convenience, installs
more than one meter, the readings will be cumulated for billing.
Billing procedures.[1]
Reading of meters. Water meters shall be read every quarterly billing period. When meter
readings cannot be obtained, the Utility shall estimate the volume of water used. This
estimate shall be based upon the average use during the past year where practical. The
difference in usage shall be adjusted when the meter is again read the succeeding billing
quarter. Estimates shall not be used in more than two successive billing periods.
Bills shall be mailed to the name and address requested by a customer or property
owner. A sequentially numbered chronological log of all such requests shall be kept in a
form readily accessible to all staff servicing customers. This information shall be
accessible by date, account number, customer or address.
Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Collection policy and procedures.[2]
Collection policy. Utility procedures and their application shall comply in all respects with
requirements of the Wisconsin Administrative Code, Wisconsin Statutes, ordinances of the
City of Burlington and Burlington Utility Rules and Regulations. The Finance Director shall see
that all payments are properly handled, to assure against fraud, misappropriation and theft,
and deposited on a timely basis to Utility interest-bearing accounts. Collection efforts shall be
uniform and persistent. The Finance Director and Utility Manager shall assure that all
personnel involved in collection activity have been trained in customer service, regulatory
requirements and Utility policy and procedures and comply with requirements. Utility staff will

an understanding of the customer's point of view. The Utility will refer customer disputes of
water and sewer charges to the Utility Manager for review.
Collection procedures.
Delinquent payments.
The Utility will apply a monthly interest charge to bills not paid within 20 days of
issuance at a rate of 1% per month. This practice shall comply with provisions of
§ PSC 185.33(10), Wis. Admin. Code. This late payment charge will be applied to
the total unpaid balance for Utility service, including unpaid late payment charges.
The Utility will carry forward arrears including late charges on each successive bill
and will clearly identify (new) late charges not previously shown.
The Utility may disconnect accounts for nonpayment as allowed by Ch. 196, Wis.
Stats., and Ch. PSC 185, Wis. Admin. Code.
Reminder notices. The Utility will provide quarterly reminder delinquent notices not less
than 20 days following bill issuance. The Utility shall continue to provide delinquent
reminder notices to the property owner and/or renter at each successive billing period.
When possible, the Utility will send annually a customer "bill of rights" insert, usually sent
with delinquent reminder notices.
Unbilled services. Pursuant to § 196.635, Wis. Stats., when an account has been
unbilled, the period of recovery will normally be limited to two years unless the customer
refused access or obtained service by fraud or deception or service was unmeasured
due to removal or tampering with the meter device.
Property owner responsible for service to rental dwelling units.
The Utility shall provide the property owner a copy of the delinquent reminder notice
every quarter for any rental property on which the renter receives the bill which is in
arrears. A record shall be kept of all reminder notices sent to property owners. This
record shall contain the account (renter's) name, property owner's name, address,
account number and date of notice. This information shall be available by service
address and account number.
When tenants pay the Utility bill for a jointly metered property and the bill becomes in
arrears, the Utility shall hold the property owner fully responsible for the bill as
provided in § 196.643(2), Wis. Stats.
Charges a lien. All arrearages as of October 15 every calendar year are subject to be
levied as a tax on the property. The property owner shall be notified by letter October 15
and given until October 31 to remit payment. If arrearages are not paid, an additional tenpercent
service fee shall be added to the balance and submitted to the county on
November 1 for inclusion on the year-end property taxes in compliance with §§ 66.0810
and 66.0821, Wis. Stats. The Utility shall keep a record to show that it has sent these
notices and shall keep a record of all arrearages assessed on the year-end tax roll and
provide it to the Finance Director and Utility Manager.
Deferred payment agreements. Deferred payment agreements shall be offered to
customers in accordance with § PSC 185.33(16), Wis. Admin. Code, to pay arrears over
an extended period of time.
Returned checks. The Utility will charge the current nonsufficient funds (NSF) fee to a
customer's account when a check is returned for insufficient funds. The customer must
repay to the Utility the amount of NSF check in cash or money order only. A letter will be
sent to the customer with notification of the NSF check, and, if not paid 10 calendar days

after the written notice, the water service will be disconnected (per § PSC 185.37, Wis.
Admin. Code). On the 11th day, the Water Utility will attempt to make contact with the
customer and post a twenty-four-hour notice of disconnection. If service is disconnected,
the customer must pay the current reconnection charge in order for water service to be
reconnected.
Investigations. Employees shall report evidence of fraudulent taking of water to the Utility
Manager, who shall investigate the occurrence and provide notice to the offending person
and follow up as appropriate. See § 941.36, Wis. Stats.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Surreptitious use of water. When the Utility has reasonable evidence that a consumer is obtaining
his supply of water, in whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere
with the proper metering of the Utility service being delivered to his equipment, the Utility reserves
the right to estimate and present immediately a bill for service unmetered as a result of such
interference, and such bill shall be payable subject to a twenty-four-hour disconnection of service.
When the Utility shall have disconnected the consumer for any such reason, the Utility will
reconnect the consumer upon the following conditions:
The consumer will be required to deposit with the Utility an amount sufficient to
guarantee the payment of the consumer's bills for Utility service to the Utility.
The consumer will be required to pay the Utility for any and all damages to its equipment
on the consumer's premises due to such stoppage or interference with its metering.
The consumer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the
Utility against further losses.
Section 943.20, Wis. Stats., as relating to water service, is hereby adopted and made a part
of these rules.
§ 304-10. General provisions.
Vacation of premises. When premises are to be vacated, the Utility shall be notified in writing at
once, so that it may remove the meter and shut off the supply at the curb cock. The owner of the
premises shall be liable to prosecution for any damage to the property of the Water Utility by
reason of failure to notify the Utility of vacancy.
No claims for damages. No person shall enter a claim for damage against the City as a Water
Utility, or any officer thereof, for damage to any pipe, fixture or appurtenance by reason of
interrupted water supply or variation of pressure, or for damage of any nature whatsoever caused
by the turning off or turning on, either wholly or partially, of the water supply for the extension,
alteration or repair of any water main or premises supply, or for the discontinuance of the
premises' water supply for the violation of any rules or regulations of the Water Utility. No claims
will be allowed against the City on account of the interruption of the water supply caused by the
breaking of pipes or machinery, or by stoppage for repairs, on account of fire or other emergency,
and no claims shall be allowed for any damage caused by the breakage of any pipe or machinery.
Repairs to mains. The Utility reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily to
make repairs, alterations or additions to the plant or system. When the circumstances will permit
of sufficient delay, the company will give notification, by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the
discontinuance of the supply. No rebate or damages will be allowed to consumers for such
temporary suspension of supply.

Duty of Utility Manager with respect to safety of the public. The Utility Manager shall see that all
open ditches for water mains, hydrants, and service pipes are properly guarded to prevent
accident to any person or vehicle, and at night there shall be displayed signal lights in such
manner as will, so far as possible, ensure the safety of the public, unless the work is being done
by a private contractor, in which case the responsibility shall rest with the private contractor.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Handling water mains and service pipes in sewer or other trenches. Where excavating machines
are used in digging sewers, all water mains shall be maintained at the expense of the contractor.
Contractors must ascertain for themselves the existence and location of all service pipes. Where
they are removed, cut or damaged in the construction of a sewer, the contractor must at his own
expense cause them to be replaced or repaired at once. He must not shut off the water service
pipes from any consumer for a period exceeding six hours.
Settling main or service trenches. Trenches in unpaved streets shall be refilled with moist, damp
earth or by means of water tamping. When water tamping is used, the water shall be turned into
the trench after the first 12 inches of backfill has been placed and then the trench shall be kept
flooded until the remainder of the backfill has been put in.
Protective devices.
Protective devices in general. The owner or occupant of every premises receiving water
supply shall apply and maintain suitable means of protection of the premises supply, and all
appliances thereof, against damage arising in any manner from the use of the water supply,
variation of water pressure or any interruption of water supply. Particularly, such owner or
occupant shall protect water-cooled compressors for refrigeration systems by means of highpressure
safety cutout devices. There shall also be provided means for the prevention of the
transmission of water ram or noise of operation of any valve or appliance through the piping
of its own or adjacent premises.
Relief valves. On all closed systems (i.e., systems having a check valve, pressure regulator or
reducing valve, water filter or softener) an effective pressure relief valve shall be installed
either in the top tapping or the upper side tapping of the hot water tank or on the hot water
distributing pipe connection at the tank. A one-half-inch drainpipe shall be connected to the
relief valve for drainage on the floor into a sink or open drain through an air gap. No stop
valve shall be placed between the hot water tank and the relief valve or on the drainpipe.
Air chambers. An air chamber or approved shock absorber shall be installed at the terminus
of each riser, fixture branch or hydraulic elevator main for the prevention of undue water
hammer. The air chamber shall have a diameter not less than that of the pipe it serves and a
length not less than 15 dias. of such supply pipe. Where possible, the air chamber should be
provided at its base with a valve and drain cock for water drainage and replenishment of air.
Flow tests. The customer of the Utility or any other person shall not conduct a flow test without first
obtaining written approval from the Utility. If such approval is obtained, the flow tests shall be
controlled under the supervision of the Utility. A fee shall be paid to the Utility for such flow tests by
the customer or any person making the same, in such amount as is from time to time determined
by the Common Council.[2]

excess of the number of hydrants in existence at the time the fee is determined.
Public Fire Protection Service - Suburban (F-2).
Water used for extinguishing fires outside the immediate service area of the Utility may
consist of water supplied to tank trucks from Utility hydrants; water supplied directly from
hydrants located within the corporate limits or on its borders by means of those lines; or water
supplied to tank trucks from any other Utility water source.
A record of the measured or estimated volume of water used shall be submitted to the Utility
after each use for fire protection outside the Utility's immediate service area. If measuring or
estimating is impossible, the Utility Manager shall be furnished such data as the size of orifice
used, pressure and the time water was permitted to flow in order to determine the volume
used.
A charge for the volume of water used for each fire, either through a tank supply or from
hydrants, will be billed to the township or fire department using water at the rate set forth in
the most recent rate schedule. A service charge, in addition to the water charge, shall be
charged per hydrant used.

month will be added to bills not paid within 20 days of issuance. This late payment charge will
be applied to the total unpaid balance for Utility service, including unpaid late payment
charges. The late payment charge is applicable to all customers. The Utility customer may be
given a written notice that the bill is overdue no sooner than 20 days after the bill is issued.
Unless payment or satisfactory arrangement for payment is made within the next 10 days,
service may be disconnected pursuant to Ch. PSC 185, Wis. Admin. Code. See also § 304-
9B(1).
Combined metering. Volumetric meter readings will be combined for billing if the Utility, for its
own convenience, places more than one meter on a single water service lateral. Multiple
meters placed for the purpose of identifying water not discharged into the sanitary sewer are
not considered for Utility convenience and shall not be combined for billing. This requirement
does not preclude the Utility from combining readings when metering configurations support
such an approach. Meter readings from individually metered separate service laterals shall
not be combined for billing purposes.
General Service - Suburban (Mg-2).
Quarterly service charge; volume charge. A quarterly service charge shall be made for each
customer outside of the corporate limits of the City at the rate set forth in Schedule Mg-2,

metered service rates applied.
Water used on an intermittent basis for flushing sewers, street sprinkling, flooding skating
rinks, drinking fountains, etc., shall be metered where meters can be set to measure the
service. Where it is impossible to measure the service, the Utility Manager shall estimate the
volume of water used based on the pressure, size of opening and period of time water is
allowed to be drawn.
General Water Service - Unmetered (Ug-1).
Rate. Where the Utility cannot immediately install its water meter, service may be supplied
temporarily on an unmetered basis for single-family residential and small commercial
customers at an approximated volume of 2,500 cubic feet per quarter under Schedule Mg-1. If
it is determined by the Utility that usage is in excess of 2,500 cubic feet per quarter, an
additional charge will be made for the estimated additional usage at the rate set forth in

Department of Natural Resources.
Permission to enter. Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the City Water
Utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property

§ 315-11. Site regulations.
No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for such use or structure
by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation,

Review of adult family homes and community living arrangements.[1]
Any property licensed or permitted by the state as an adult family home as defined in § 50.01,
Wis. Stats., or a community living arrangement as defined in § 46.03(22), Wis. Stats., whether
or not a conditional use permit is required therefor, shall be subject to review by the Common
Council not less than 11 months nor more than 13 months after first licensure and every year
thereafter.
The purpose of such review, which shall be in the form of a hearing before the Common
Council, shall be to make a determination as to the effect of the adult family home or
community living arrangement on the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the City
pursuant to the provisions of § 62.23(7)(i), Wis. Stats.
If the Common Council determines that the adult family home or community living
arrangement poses a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the City, it may
order the adult family home or community living arrangement to cease operation unless
special zoning permission is obtained. The decision of the Council is subject to judicial review.
The adult family home or community living arrangement must cease operation within 90 days
after the date of the order, the date of the final judicial review of the order, or the date of the
denial of special zoning permission, whichever is later.
The City's failure to perform any such annual review shall not serve to bar such a review in
any subsequent year.
Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 315-12. Reduction or joint use.
No lot, yard, parking area, building area, or other space shall be reduced in area or dimensions so as
not to meet the provisions of this chapter. No part of any lot, yard, parking area, or other space
required for a structure or use shall be used for any other structure or use.
§ 315-12.1. Special site regulations for shoreland areas.
[Added 5-6-2003 by Ord. No. 1721(1)]
In all of those shoreland areas of the City of Burlington annexed or attached to the City of Burlington
after May 7, 1982, the following minimum lot sizes, building setbacks, cutting of trees and shrubbery,
filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching, and excavating regulations shall apply:
Minimum lot sizes. Minimum lot sizes in the shoreland area shall be established to afford
protection against danger to health, safety and welfare and protection against pollution of the
adjacent body of water.
Lots served by public sanitary sewer shall have a minimum lot width of 65 feet and a
minimum area of 10,000 square feet.
Lots not served by public sanitary sewer shall have a minimum width of 150 feet and a
minimum area of 40,000 square feet. When there is a reasonable likelihood that unsewered
lot will be sewered within 10 years and that the required frontage thereafter will be 75 feet, the
City Plan Commission or subdivider may cause dotted lines to be drawn across the center of
the lots applicable on plat and zoning maps so as to notify prospective purchasers of that
possibility.

screen any development from stream or lake uses. Paths and trails shall not exceed 10 feet in
width and shall be so designed and constructed as to result in the least removal and
disruption of shoreland cover and the minimum impairment of natural beauty. Any path or trail
within the thirty-five-foot area described above shall be constructed and surfaced so as to
effectively control erosion.
The City Plan Commission or the Zoning Administrator shall request a review of such tree
cutting and shrubbery clearing in excess of one acre by the Wisconsin Department of Natural

Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six inches
above ground level in a horizontal position at the interior line of the bufferyard or at the
property line, as required herein. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed long enough to provide a constant reading. In order to eliminate the effects of
moonlight and other ambient light, measurements shall be made after dark with the light
source in question on, then with the same source off. The differences between the two
readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted illumination allowed under this
Subsection P.

Site plans to be submitted to Plan Commission. Every builder of any building hereafter erected or
structurally altered for manufacturing use shall, before a building permit is issued, present detailed
site plans pertaining to the proposed structure to the City Plan Commission, which will approve
said plans only after determining that the proposed building will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property or substantially increase the danger of fire or traffic congestion or
otherwise endanger the public health or safety or substantially diminish or impair property values
within the neighborhood.
Exterior lighting standards and lighting plan required. Exterior lighting plans shall be required for
new development or redevelopment of existing exterior lighting in the M-1 Light Manufacturing
District. At the time any exterior light is installed or substantially modified in the M-1 District, and
whenever a zoning permit application is made for new development or redevelopment, an exterior
lighting plan shall be submitted to the Plan Commission in order to determine whether the
requirements of this subsection have been met and that adjoining property will not be adversely
impacted by the proposed lighting.
[Added 6-6-2006 by Ord. No. 1798(2)]
A lighting plan submitted pursuant to the requirements of this subsection shall have, at a
minimum, the following elements:
A catalog page, cut sheet, or photograph of the luminaire, including the mounting
method, a graphic depiction of the luminaire lamp (or bulb) concealment, and graphic
depiction of light cutoff angles.
A photometric data test report of the proposed luminaire graphically showing the lighting
distribution in all angles vertically and horizontally around the luminaire.
A plot plan, drawn to a recognized engineering or architectural scale, indicating the
location of the luminaire(s) proposed, mounting and/or installation height in feet, the
overall illumination levels (in footcandles) and lighting uniformities on the site, and the
illumination levels (in footcandles) at the property boundary lines. This may be
accomplished by means of an isolux curve or computer printout projecting the
illumination levels.
Exterior lighting in the M-1 District shall be limited to total-cutoff-type luminaires (with angle
greater than 90°). The maximum permitted illumination shall be two footcandles and the
maximum permitted luminaire height shall be 30 feet as measured from surrounding grade to
the bottom of the luminaire. (Note: This standard does not address illumination levels or
fixture height which may be required by the City of Burlington for the adequate lighting of
public street rights-of-way. It represents maximum illumination levels on private property.)
For the purposes of this subsection, light shall be measured as follows:
Metering equipment. Lighting levels shall be measured in footcandles with a directreading,
portable light meter. The meter shall be read within an accuracy of plus or minus
5%. The meter shall have been tested, calibrated, and certified by an independent
commercial photometric laboratory or the manufacturer within 30 days of its use.
Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six inches
above ground level in a horizontal position at the interior line of the bufferyard or at the

§ 315-32. M-3 Manufacturing and Office Park District.
[Added 3-5-1996 by Ord. No. 1525(31)]
Intent. The M-3 Manufacturing and Office Park District is intended to provide for the development
of the attractive grouping of light manufacturing, light industrial, warehousing, and office
development uses with limited ancillary service uses in a campus-like setting which serves the
needs of the occupants of the M-3 Manufacturing and Office Park District and provides primary
employment opportunities to the Burlington area. Uses in the M-3 District are intended to be of a
limited intensity and would provide an aesthetically pleasing, well-landscaped environment to
preserve the value of property and protect the land development investment in the M-3 District.
The M-3 District is further intended to provide for ample off-street parking and loading areas and
landscape planting and screening from adjacent land uses of a lower land use intensity. The M-3
District is also intended to accommodate light manufacturing, light industrial, warehousing, and
office parks under unified design controls. The area and bulk requirements of the M-3 District are
intended to permit moderate-intensity development in such a manner that enhances and protects
the character of the City and surrounding environs. Because of its high trip generation rates, the
M-3 District is intended to be located adjacent to arterial streets and highways. A full range of
public services is required for the M-3 District.
M-3 District permitted uses. Those uses designated as permitted uses on Table 2 of this chapter.
[1] In interpreting the various use designations, reference should be made to the Standard
Industrial Classification Manual (1987 or latest edition), published by Executive Office of the
President, Office of Management and Budget. A three- or four-digit Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) code number is given for each permitted use type listed in Table 2.
Editor's Note: Table 2 is included at the end of this chapter.
M-3 District accessory uses. Permitted accessory uses in the M-3 District shall be as follows:
Off-street parking and loading areas.
Garages for storage of vehicles used in conjunction with the operation of a business.
Offices accessory to a principal use.
Outdoor storage areas meeting the requirements of this chapter.
Conditional uses. Those uses designated as conditional uses on Table 2 of this chapter.[2] In
interpreting the various use designations, reference should be made to the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual (1987 or latest edition), published by Executive Office of the President,
Office of Management and Budget. A four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code
number is given for each conditional use type listed in Table 2.

set forth in Table 3.[3]
Editor's Note: Table 3 is included at the end of this chapter.
Off-street parking standards. Off-street parking requirements for the M-3 District shall be as
indicated in Article V of this chapter.
Screening of outdoor storage. No portion of any lot shall be used for open or unscreened storage
of any kind. Outdoor storage areas shall be screened from view of any public street right-of-way,
public park or public open space area and from the view from all residential zoning districts. The
screening of all such areas in the M-3 District shall consist of the following:
Walls and fences. Solid walls or solid fences at least eight feet in height and in no case lower
in height than the enclosed storage area when a height exceeding eight feet is approved by
the Plan Commission. Access to such storage areas shall be through solid gates that shall be
closed except when said outdoor storage area is in use for the transport of stored materials.
In addition, all such outdoor storage areas shall provide a contiguous landscaped area
meeting the minimum requirements of a bufferyard intensity factor of two as set forth in Table
9 of this chapter.[4]
Editor's Note: Table 9 is included at the end of this chapter.
Accessory permanent structures. An accessory permanent structure may be used to screen
such storage areas. Access to such outdoor storage areas shall be through solid gates that
shall be closed except when said outdoor storage area is in use for the transport of stored
materials. All such outdoor storage areas shall provide a contiguous landscaped area meeting
the minimum requirements of a bufferyard intensity factor of two as set forth in Table 9 of this
chapter. All such accessory permanent structures used for storage shall be subject to the
architectural review standards and requirements of this chapter.
Outdoor storage area maintenance required. Fencing and landscaping for outdoor storage
areas shall be maintained in good condition and kept litter-free.
Outdoor storage location in off-street parking space or drive prohibited. No outdoor storage
shall be permitted in any off-street parking space or drive.
Building permit required for the construction of outdoor storage enclosures. A building permit
shall be required for the construction of any outdoor storage enclosure.

A plot plan, drawn to a recognized engineering or architectural scale, indicating the
location of the luminaire(s) proposed, mounting and/or installation height in feet, the
overall illumination levels (in footcandles) and uniformities on the site, and the
illumination levels (in footcandles) at the property boundary lines. This may be
accomplished by means of an isolux curve or computer printout projecting the
illumination levels.
Exterior lighting in the M-3 District shall meet one of the following standards:
Requirements for the use of no cutoff-type luminaires. When a light source or luminaire
has no cutoff-type luminaire, the maximum permitted illumination shall be 0.30 footcandle
and the maximum permitted luminaire height shall be 25 feet. (Note: This standard does
not address illumination levels or fixture height which may be required by the City of
Burlington for the adequate lighting of public street rights-of-way. It represents maximum
illumination levels on private property.)
Requirements for total cutoff-type luminaires (with angle greater than 90º). When a
luminaire has total cutoff of light at an angle greater than 90º, the maximum permitted
illumination shall be 2.0 footcandles and the maximum permitted luminaire height shall be
30 feet. (Note: This standard does not address illumination levels or fixture height which
may be required by the City of Burlington for the adequate lighting of public street rightsof-
way. It represents maximum illumination levels on private property.)
Requirements for total cutoff-type luminaire (with angle of 90º or less). When a luminaire
has total cutoff of light at an angle of 90º or less and is located so that the bare light bulb,
lamp, or light source is completely shielded from the direct view of an observer five feet
above the ground at the point where the cutoff angle intersects the ground, the maximum
permitted illumination shall be 2.0 footcandles and the maximum permitted luminaire
height shall be 40 feet. (Note: This standard does not address illumination levels or
fixture height which may be required by the City of Burlington for the adequate lighting of
public street rights-of-way. It represents maximum illumination levels on private property.)
[7]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
For the purposes of this chapter, light shall be measured as follows:
Metering equipment. Lighting levels shall be measured in footcandles with a directreading,
portable light meter. The meter shall be read within an accuracy of plus or minus
5%. The meter shall have been tested, calibrated, and certified by an independent
commercial photometric laboratory or the manufacturer within 30 days of its use.
Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six inches
above ground level in a horizontal position at the interior line of the bufferyard or at the
property line, as required herein. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed long enough to provide a constant reading. In order to eliminate the effects of
moonlight and other ambient light, measurements shall be made after dark with the light
source in question on, then with the same source off. The differences between the two
readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted illumination allowed under this
Subsection L.
Architectural standards and architectural plans required. For promoting compatible development
and stability of property values and to prevent impairment or depreciation of property values in the
M-3 District, no person shall erect any structure without first obtaining the approval of the
architectural plans by the Plan Commission as set forth in this subsection.
Principles and standards of review. In its consideration of applications for architectural review,
the Plan Commission shall consider and evaluate the propriety of granting the approval in

terms of the effect of the application on the general purposes for which architectural approval
is required. The following principles and standards for architectural review are used by the
Plan Commission in its review, approval, or denial of the architectural plans in the M-3 District.
These are also intended to be a design aid for builders and owners to use in the preparation
of architectural plans. A building permit shall not be issued for any building in the M-3 District
which does not meet the requirements of this Subsection M. To implement this Subsection M,
the following architectural review principles and guidelines are established:
Building scale and mass. The size and mass of buildings and structures in relation to
open spaces, windows, door openings, etc., shall be visually compatible with the
buildings, public ways, and places to which they are visually related. The relative
proportion of a building to its neighboring existing buildings, to pedestrians or observers,
or to other existing buildings shall be maintained or enhanced when new buildings are
built or when existing buildings are remodeled or altered.
Building facade and appurtenance continuity. Building facades and appurtenances such
as walls, fences, and landscape masses shall, when they are a characteristic of the area,
form cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to ensure visual compatibility with the
buildings, public ways, and places to which such elements are visually related.
Building height, rooflines, and roof shapes. The height of the proposed buildings and
structures shall be visually compatible with adjacent buildings and shall not exceed the
M-3 District height requirements for both principal and accessory structures. The visual
continuity of roofs and their contributing elements (parapet walls, coping, cornices, etc.)
shall be maintained in building development or redevelopment.
Building design proportions. The following shall be used as guidelines for evaluating
building design proportions:
Proportion of front facade. The relationship of the width to the height of the front
elevation shall be visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and places to
which it is visually related.
Proportion of openings. The relationship of the width to height of windows shall be
visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and places to which the building is
visually related.
Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of solids to voids in the
front facade of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings, public ways,
and places to which it is visually related.
Rhythm of spacing and buildings on streets. The relationship of the building or
structure to the open space between it and adjoining buildings or structures shall be
visually compatible with the buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually
related.
Rhythm of entrance and other projections. The relationship of entrances and other
projections to sidewalks shall be visually compatible with the buildings, public ways,
and places to which they are visually related.
Directional expression and emphasis of building elevations. A building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually related in its
directional character, whether this is vertical character, horizontal character, or
nondirectional character.
Building materials and prohibited building materials. Building material selection for
architectural design shall be based upon the prevailing material already used on existing
buildings in the area. No building shall be permitted where any exposed facade is

constructed or faced with a finished material that is aesthetically incompatible with other
building facades in the area or which presents an unattractive appearance to the public
and surrounding properties.
The use of the following building materials for exterior building facades shall be
prohibited on any building facade facing a public street right-of-way:
Plain concrete.
Plain concrete block.
Metal siding.

Plywood and wood panel composite siding.
The use of the following building materials for exterior building facades is
encouraged:
Brick masonry and/or brick masonry veneer.
Decorative and split face concrete block masonry.
Decorative concrete and concrete panels.
Colors. Since the selection of building colors has a significant aesthetic and visual impact
upon the public and neighboring properties, color shall be selected in general harmony
with the existing area or neighborhood buildings.
Design repetition. A building design may not be repeated within four lots of an existing
building. This shall apply to all buildings, whether or not they are constructed by the same
builder.
Story distinctions. The first story of the building should be distinguished from the second
story by means of a horizontal lintel, second floor overhang or setback, or similar detail.
Elevations of buildings facing the public streets on a corner lot. Buildings on corner lots
shall continue the major front elevation design elements on the second building elevation
which faces a public street.
Building elevations clad with a singular exterior surface material. Building elevations clad
with a singular exterior surface material shall provide some additional architectural design
element(s) to break up the plane of the wall. This may be done by the addition of
window(s), gable end wall treatments, siding design and accent panels, or other
architectural design treatments consistent with the principal building design.
Foundations below overhanging bays. Buildings shall be designed with foundations
below all bays that overhang the building foundation. The Plan Commission will allow the
construction of bay windows and/or projections of floors above the first floor, if they are a
minimum of 12 inches above grade.
Signs placed on buildings. For signs placed on buildings, sign materials, forms, and
designs shall be integral with the building architecture and shall comply with all signage
requirements.
Applications for architectural review. Architectural review applications for building in the M-3
District, including architectural plans and related data and materials, shall be submitted to the
Building Inspector, who shall transmit all such applications and their accompanying data and

A catalog page, cut sheet, or photograph of the luminaire, including the mounting
method, a graphic depiction of the luminaire lamp (or bulb) concealment, and graphic
depiction of light cutoff angles.
A photometric data test report of the proposed luminaire graphically showing the lighting
distribution in all angles vertically and horizontally around the luminaire.
A plot plan, drawn to a recognized engineering or architectural scale, indicating the
location of the luminaire(s) proposed, mounting and/or installation height in feet, the
overall illumination levels (in footcandles) and lighting uniformities on the site, and the
illumination levels (in footcandles) at the property boundary lines. This may be
accomplished by means of an isolux curve or computer printout projecting the
illumination levels.
Exterior lighting in the Q-1 District shall be limited to total-cutoff-type luminaires (with angle
greater than 90°). The maximum permitted illumination shall be two footcandles and the
maximum permitted luminaire height shall be 30 feet as measured from surrounding grade to
the bottom of the luminaire. (Note: This standard does not address illumination levels or
fixture height which may be required by the City of Burlington for the adequate lighting of
public street rights-of-way. It represents maximum illumination levels on private property.)
For the purposes of this subsection, light shall be measured as follows:
Metering equipment. Lighting levels shall be measured in footcandles with a directreading,
portable light meter. The meter shall be read within an accuracy of plus or minus
5%. The meter shall have been tested, calibrated, and certified by an independent
commercial photometric laboratory or the manufacturer within 30 days of its use.
Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six inches
above ground level in a horizontal position at the interior line of the bufferyard or at the
property line, as required herein. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed long enough to provide a constant reading. In order to eliminate the effects of
moonlight and other ambient light, measurements shall be made after dark with the light
source in question on, then with the same sources off. The differences between the two
readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted illumination allowed under this
subsection.

alterations shall include any exterior change (including painting), addition to, or demolition of
any part or all of the exterior of a structure. The Common Council shall make its decision
within 45 days of its receipt of the Historic Preservation Commission's recommendation
regarding the application for a certificate of appropriateness. The recommendation by the
Historic Preservation Commission for a certificate of appropriateness for signage, however,
shall be forwarded to the Building Inspector for a final review and approval, with no Common
Council approval being required. Persons who are granted a certificate of appropriateness by
the Common Council are required to obtain all other permits required by this Municipal Code
or by the State of Wisconsin, from the appropriate authority, for the proposed alteration.

Ord. No. 2004(10)]
Basis for approval. No alterations shall be permitted that would tend to destroy or seriously
impair the particular character and quality of the HPO Historic Preservation Overlay District.
No change or alteration (including painting) of an historic structure, historic site, or historic
district shall be permitted which destroys, seriously impairs, or significantly alters its character
in terms of its historical or architectural interest.
Repairs, destruction and reconstruction.
[Amended 12-7-2004 by Ord. No. 1762(14)]
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 315-84, total lifetime structural repairs, restoration, or
alterations of a preservation structure may exceed 50% of the City's equalized value of
the structure if the Common Council determines, upon recommendation by the Historic
Preservation Commission, that the structure will be repaired, restored, or altered in a way
that maintains the character of the structure and the character of the HPO District without
significant alteration or change in such character. No person in charge of an historic
structure or improvement in an HPO Historic Preservation Overlay District shall be
granted a permit to demolish such property without review and recommendations by the
Historic Preservation Commission to the Common Council.
In the case of a two-story structure in the HPO District which has been destroyed, the
Common Council may determine, upon recommendation by the Historic Preservation
Commission, that the replacement structure may be constructed as a one-story structure
but in a way that maintains the historic character of the destroyed two-story structure and
the character of the HPO District streetscape facade without significant alteration or
change in such character.
Placement of satellite antenna dishes. [Added 8-16-2005 by Ord. No. 1784(8)]
Definition. A "satellite antenna dish" is defined as:
A dish antenna that is one meter (39.37 inches) or less in diameter and is designed
to receive direct broadcast satellite service, including direct-to-home satellite service;
or
An antenna that is one meter or less in diameter or diagonal measurement and is
designed to receive video programming services via MMDS (wireless cable). Such
antennas may be mounted on masts to reach the height needed to establish line-ofsight
contact with the transmitter; or
An antenna that is designed to receive local television broadcast signals; or
Other contemporary communications devices similar to the above, as may be
defined by the Federal Communications Commission, and as the above descriptions
may be amended by the Federal Communications Commission from time to time.

Regulations. All satellite antenna dishes erected in the Historic Preservation Overlay
District shall conform to the following regulations:
Whenever a satellite antenna dish is affixed to a building, it must be installed to
avoid damaging the structure. For example, when affixed to a masonry structure, it
should be attached to mortar joints, not the brick or stone.
No more than two satellite antenna dishes are allowed on a lot or per dwelling unit,
whichever is greater.
Satellite antenna dishes shall be no larger than one meter in diameter.
Satellite antenna dishes shall not be visible from a public street unless no signal
reception is possible or reception will be substantially degraded if located in an
allowed location on the lot.
Satellite antenna dishes mounted to a tower where the total height will exceed 12
feet (as measured from surrounding grade) require a building permit.
No signage is to be placed on satellite antenna dishes or antenna structures.
The following satellite antenna dish placement shall not require a review for a
certificate of appropriateness:
Satellite antenna dishes, as well as other contemporary communications
devices, which are located unobtrusively within the HPO District. The placement
of these devices will not require a review if they are located on or near a
structure so that they are not visible from the street. Specifically, the antennas
should be located at the rear of the primary building or attached to the rear of
the primary building (either on the rear walls or the rear slopes of the roof).
On the front of a building. If the only possible location for the placement of a satellite
antenna dish is attachment to the front of a building, either attached to the wall of the
building or on the front roof slope, then the proposed design and location of the
antenna, as well as any proposed screening material, must be submitted to the HPC
for review. The antenna should be placed so that it is screened from view from the
street or compatibly incorporated into the facade design. These options are only
available if there is no other location for placement of the satellite dish antenna and it
would be considered a hardship situation.
Mounting hardware, including but not limited to wiring and poles, shall not be visible
from a public street.
Revocation and expiration of certificate of appropriateness. In any case where a certificate of
appropriateness has been granted by the Common Council for alterations in the architectural
appearance of any structure within an HPO District and has not been established within one
year after the date of granting thereof, then without further action by the Historic Preservation
Commission or Common Council, the certificate of appropriateness authorization shall be null
and void unless upon the showing of valid cause by the applicant, the Common Council (upon
recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission) may grant an extension of such
certificate of appropriateness for a period not to exceed one year.

Intent.
The PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District is intended to permit developments that
will, over a period of time, be enhanced by coordinated area site planning, diversified location
of structures, and/or mixing of compatible uses. Such developments are intended to provide a
safe and efficient system for pedestrian and vehicle traffic; to provide attractive recreation and
open spaces as integral parts of the developments; to enable economic design in the location
of public and private utilities and community facilities; and to ensure adequate standards of
construction and planning. The PUD Overlay District under this chapter will allow for flexibility
of overall development design with benefits from such design flexibility intended to be derived
by both the developer and the community, while at the same time maintaining insofar as
possible the land use density and other standards or use requirements as set forth in the
underlying basic zoning district.
The unified and planned development of a site in a single, partnership, or corporate
ownership or control or in common ownership under the Condominium Ownership Act set
forth in Ch. 703, Wis. Stats., may be permitted by the City upon specific petition under this
section and after public hearing, with such development encompassing one or more principal
uses or structures and related accessory uses or structures, when all regulations and
standards as set forth in this section have been met.
Overlay districts provide for the possibility of superimposing certain additional requirements
upon a basic underlying zoning district without disturbing the requirements of the basic
district. In the instance of conflicting use requirements, the more strict of the conflicting
requirements shall apply.
PUD permitted uses. Any use permitted in the underlying basic use district.
PUD permitted accessory uses. Any accessory use permitted in the underlying basic use district.
PUD conditional uses (see also § 315-130 of this chapter). Any conditional use permitted in the
underlying basic use district.
Minimum area requirements. Areas designated as Planned Unit Development Overlay Districts
shall be under single or corporate ownership or control and shall contain a minimum development
area of:

Density requirements (lot area, width and yard requirements). The district area, width, and yard
requirements of the underlying basic use district may be modified; however, in no case shall the
average density in the district exceed the number of dwelling units that would have been permitted
if the Planned Unit Development Overlay District regulations had not been utilized.
Building height and area.
Buildings in a Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall not exceed the height
permitted in the underlying basic use district.

I.
The Wellhead Protection Overlay District (WPO) is intended to provide land use regulations
and restrictions within a defined area that contributes water directly to a municipal water
supply and thus promote public health, safety, and welfare. The district is intended to protect
the groundwater recharge area for the existing or future municipal water supply from
contamination.
The WPO District is described in accordance with the wellhead protection area as set forth in
the wellhead protection plans referenced in Subsection B. This district is described as
multiple areas lying within the City and within a radius of 1,200 feet of each municipal well of
the City of Burlington.
Conflict in regulations. The regulations of the WPO District will apply in addition to all other
regulations which cover the same geographic area. If there is a conflict between the provisions of
this overlay district and the underlying zoning district, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
District boundaries. The boundaries of each WPO District shall be shown on the Burlington Zoning
Map. The locations and boundaries of the zoning district established by this section are set forth
on the City of Burlington Wellhead Protection Overlay District Map, Exhibit A, which is
incorporated herein and hereby made a part of this section as though fully set forth and described
herein, and shall be incorporated into the City Zoning Map.[2]
Editor's Note: Exhibit A is on file in the City offices.

The Burlington Plan Commission shall decide upon a request for a conditional use permit only
after full consideration of the recommendations made by the Burlington Wellhead Technical
Review Committee. Any conditions above and beyond those specified in Conditional uses,
Subsection L(5) herein, that are recommended by the Burlington Wellhead Technical Review
Committee may be applied to the granting of the conditional use permit.
Requirements for existing facilities which may cause or threaten to cause environmental pollution.
Existing facilities within the WPO District at the time of enactment of such district which may cause
or threaten to cause environmental pollution include, but are not limited to, those types listed in the
Department of Natural Resources' Form 3300-215, Public Water Supply Potential Contaminant
Use Inventory Form, and all other facilities which are considered a prohibited use in Subsection J,
or a conditional use in Subsection L, Conditional uses, all of which are incorporated herein as if
fully set forth.
Such facilities as above which exist within the district at the time of enactment of a district
shall provide copies of all current, revised or new federal, state and local facility operation
approvals, permits or certificates; operational safety plans; and ongoing environmental
monitoring results to the City.
Such facilities as above which exist within the district at the time of enactment of a district
shall have the responsibility of devising, filing and maintaining, with the City, a current
contingency plan which details how they intend to respond to any emergency which may
cause or threaten to cause environmental pollution that occurs at their facility, including
notifying municipal, county and state officials.
Such facilities as above cannot engage in or employ a use, activity, or structure listed in
Subsection J, Prohibited uses, or in Subsection L, Conditional uses, which they did not
engage in or employ at the time of enactment of a district, and can only expand, replace or
rebuild those present uses, activities, equipment, or structures on the site or property of
record associated with the facility at the time of enactment of a district, and in a manner that
improves the environmental and safety technologies already being utilized. No existing use,
activity, or structure listed as a prohibited use or conditional use shall be expanded, replaced,
or rebuilt unless a conditional use permit is granted for such expansion, replacement, or
rebuilding. This section does not apply to normal maintenance or minor repairs.
Changing technology.
The uses prohibited by this district are prohibited based upon the combined pollution
experience of many individual uses, and the technology generally employed by a particular
use considered being of a high risk for pollution to the groundwater resource. As the
technology of other uses change to low or nonrisk materials or methods, upon petition from
such use, after conferring with the Wellhead Technical Review Committee or other expert
opinion, and after appropriate public notice and hearing, the City through appropriate
procedures and actions to change these provisions of the Burlington Municipal Code may
remove from the designated prohibited uses such uses as are demonstrated convincingly that
they no longer pose a groundwater pollution hazard.
In dealing with uses which attempt to become permissible, under the terms of this district, by
continuing to utilize pollutant materials but altering their processing, storage and handling, it is
not the intention to accept alternate or reduced hazards as the basis for making a use
permissible. It is the intention to continue a prohibition on such uses until the technology of

this section shall be subject to a penalty as provided in Chapter 1 of the Municipal Code.
Injunction. The City of Burlington may, in addition to any other remedy, seek an injunction or
restraining order against the party alleged to have violated the provisions herein, the cost of
which shall be charged to the defendant in such action.
Cleanup costs. As a substitute for, and in addition to any other action, the City of Burlington
may commence legal action against both the person who releases the contaminants and the

with the costs of prosecution. Any person who causes the release of any contaminants which
may endanger or contaminate the municipal water supply system associated with a Wellhead
Protection Overlay District shall immediately cease such discharge and immediately initiate
cleanup satisfactory to the City of Burlington and the other state and federal regulatory
agencies. The person who releases such contaminants and the person who owns the facility
whereon the contaminants have been released shall be jointly and severally responsible for
the cost of cleanup, consultant, or other contractor fees, including all administrative costs for
oversight, review and documentation, including the City employees, equipment, and mileage.
Conflict. Where any terms or requirements of this section may be inconsistent or conflicting, the
most restrictive requirements or interpretations shall apply.

Chapter purposes and intent. The proposed use will be in harmony with the general and
specific purposes for which this chapter was enacted and for which the regulations of the
zoning district in question were established.
Adverse impact. The proposed use will not have a substantial or undue adverse or
detrimental effect upon or endanger adjacent property, the character of the area, or the public
health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare and will not substantially diminish and
impair property values within the community or neighborhood.

constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to
interfere with the use and development of neighboring property according to the applicable
zoning district regulations.
Adequate facilities. The proposed use will be served adequately by streets, off-street or onstreet
parking, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, and other public facilities or the
applicant will provide adequately for such facilities as well as provide for safe vehicular and
pedestrian access and egress to the site.

measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic
congestion on the public streets.
Destruction of significant features. The proposed temporary use will not result in the
destruction, loss, or damage of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant
importance.
Compliance with standards. The temporary use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable dimensional regulations of the district in which it is located. The proposed use shall
comply with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provision of this chapter.
Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence establishes that the foregoing
standards have been met, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the following:
Public benefit. Whether and to what extent the proposed temporary use at the particular
location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service that is in the interest of the
public convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or
community.
Alternative locations. Whether and to what extent such public benefit goals can be met by the
location of the proposed temporary use at another site or in another area that may be more
appropriate than the proposed site.
Mitigation of adverse impacts. Whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken
to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity through site
design and screening.
Conditions on zoning permit for a temporary use. The Zoning Administrator may impose such
conditions and limitations concerning use, location, maintenance, screening, operation, hours of
operation (except as may be allowed by other federal, state, or county requirements), and other
matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this chapter upon the premises benefited by the
issuance of a zoning permit for a temporary use as the Zoning Administrator deems may be
necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and
improvements near the subject property and upon public facilities and services, to protect the
public interest, and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in this
chapter. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the zoning permit for a temporary use.
Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this chapter and shall constitute
grounds for revocation of the zoning permit for a temporary use.
Effect of issuance of a zoning permit for a temporary use. The grant of a zoning permit for a
temporary use shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any such use as a permanent
use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any
other permits or approvals that may be required by the ordinances of the City of Burlington,
including but not limited to a building permit, zoning permit, occupancy permit, land division
approval, site plan approval, or other type of permit or approval.

to achieve a sufficient level of landscaping, the standards set forth in this section may be
reduced by up to 30% by the Plan Commission.
Floodplain, floodway, floodlands, and wetland areas. Areas located within floodplains,
floodways, floodlands, and wetlands are exempt from the landscaping requirements set
forth in this section.
Bufferyards to ameliorate nuisances between certain adjacent zoning districts. A bufferyard is a
combination of a setback and a visual buffer or barrier and is a yard or area together with the
planting and/or landscape structure required thereon. The amount of land, the type of planting,
and the amount of planting specified for each bufferyard requirement of this chapter are designed
to ameliorate nuisances between certain adjacent zoning districts.
Bufferyards required to separate different zoning districts. Bufferyards shall be required to
separate different zoning districts from each other. Bufferyards function to eliminate or minimize
potential nuisances, such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or
parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires
or explosions.
Standard plant units. All landscaping requirements of this section are stated in terms of the
number of standard plant units required. This section defines the standard plant unit and its
alternatives. All required landscaping shall conform to one or more of the plant unit alternatives of
this section. Table 6 specifies the plant unit alternatives.[1] The five alternative plant mixes are
interchangeable. Where a year-round screen is required, Alternative Unit A is preferred and may
be required by the Plan Commission.

Credit for existing plant materials. Credit for existing plant material will be allowed to offset
required plant unit landscaping in the bufferyards and parking lots as follows:
Bufferyards. Existing canopy trees six feet in height or more shall be counted on an individual
basis towards the planting requirements; all other components of a plant unit are required,
including all understory trees, evergreen trees, and shrubs.
Parking lots. Any existing canopy trees six feet in height or more and located within parking
lot areas shall be subtracted from the required amount of parking lot landscaping on a treeby-
tree basis.
General landscaping requirements.
Physical containment of landscaped areas. All landscaped areas located within or adjacent to
a parking area, or adjacent to a public street or sidewalk, shall be designed to contain
landscape materials and to prevent vehicular encroachment (i.e., through the use of
continuous concrete curbing, railroad ties, headers, or depressed construction).
Artificial landscape materials. Artificial trees, shrubs, turf, or plants shall not be permitted as
landscaping.
Ground cover. The use of landscape fabrics under all areas landscaped with nonliving
materials, except those areas set aside for stormwater retention/detention, is recommended
to prevent weed growth.
Location. New vegetation shall be selected, planted, and maintained so that at maturity it will
not interfere with utility lines, snow storage areas, vehicular parking, pedestrian circulation,
and traffic sight visibility at driveways and street intersections and will not cause damage or
upheaval of sidewalks and pavement.
Installation.
Timing of installation. Landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the approved
landscape plan prior to issuance of an occupancy permit. The City of Burlington will have
the right to refuse approval of any project not meeting the provisions of this section.
Financial surety required. If approved landscaping cannot be installed prior to the
issuance of an occupancy permit, an occupancy permit may be issued by the City of
Burlington if the applicant provides a form of surety acceptable to the City Attorney which
meets the total estimated costs of the approved landscaping improvements. The
application shall be accompanied by a complete estimate of the total cost of the
approved landscaping. All landscape materials shall be guaranteed by the applicant, or
the applicant's contractor, for two years.
Return of financial surety. When it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that the
landscaping has been installed in accordance with the approved plans, the City of
Burlington shall return the financial surety to the applicant.
Maintenance.
Responsibility for maintenance.
Maintenance of all landscaping shall be the responsibility of the property owner or
homeowners' association (as applicable) and shall consist of regular watering, pruning,
mowing, fertilizing, and the removal and replacement of irrigation systems and
architectural features.
The owner or liable entity in control of any private premises shall at all times maintain the
premises free of litter and weeds.

Landscape phasing. Future building pads within a phased development shall be maintained in
a dust-free condition vegetated with ground cover.
Plant replacement. Any plant materials included in an approved landscaping plan that do not
survive a plant establishment period of two years after installation shall be replaced with plant
material(s) of the same or like species of equal size within the next planting season, but in
any event within six months of the plant's demise. Said replacement shall be made by the
property owner, or, in the case of landscape plant materials located within a landscape
easement under the control of a homeowners' association, the homeowners' association shall
be responsible for said replacement.
General bufferyard requirements.
Basis of standards. Bufferyard standards are based on a required relative bufferyard intensity
value. A variety of combinations of bufferyard width, planting intensity, and structural options
(i.e., fences and earthen berms) may be selected from Table 6 to reach the required
bufferyard intensity value.[2]
Editor's Note: Table 6 is included at the end of this chapter.
Location of bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located along the outer perimeter of a lot or
parcel and shall extend to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on
any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or right-of-way.
Bufferyard plant material groupings. Required bufferyard plantings may be planted in naturalappearing
groupings along the total length of the bufferyard and need not be spaced
uniformly along said total bufferyard length.
Plant materials.
For each bufferyard listed, a specific combination of deciduous canopy, shade, and
understory trees; evergreen trees; and shrubs is required as indicated in Table 6.
All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless such
vegetation is already fully established.
The exact placement of required plants and structures shall be the decision of the
property developer.
Fences. Fences used to achieve the required bufferyard intensity factor shall be constructed
of rock, masonry, or wood. Chain link fences and chain link with slats shall be prohibited from
being used to achieve required bufferyard intensity factors. All fences used shall also meet
the requirements for the construction of fences of this chapter.[3]
Editor's Note: See § 315-51, Fences.
Height of required vegetation. Height of vegetation selected for required bufferyards shall be
measured from the highest finished adjacent grade of the element to be screened.
Berming. Earthen berms shall be designed to transition to existing surrounding grades, not to
exceed a slope ratio of 2:1, and shall be covered with plant material or ground cover or
partially rip-rapped to prevent erosion. Berms with vegetative cover shall be designed to
retain irrigation water rather than encourage runoff. All earthen berms shall be safely
designed in order to accommodate mowing when needed.
Calculation of bufferyard requirements.
Bufferyard requirements are calculated using the standards listed in this section for
bufferyards.

Bufferyard standards listed in this section are to be calculated for every 100 linear feet of
peripheral lot line boundary and/or street frontage present on a given lot.
In instances where the zoning district boundary and/or street frontage is less than 100
feet, the required bufferyard planting shall be one plant unit (see Table 6).
Procedures for determining minimum required bufferyards. To determine the type of
bufferyard required on a parcel, between two parcels or lots, or between a parcel or lot
and a street, the following procedures shall be used:
Identify whether any portion or property line of the parcel or lot coincides with a
zoning district boundary. If it does, determine the abutting zoning districts on both
sides of the property line.
Refer to Table 7 to determine the required bufferyard intensity factor needed to be
achieved between the two zoning districts.[4]
Editor's Note: Table 7 is included at the end of this chapter.
Based upon the bufferyard intensity factor required, refer to the applicable Tables 8
to 12[5] to select the minimum number of plant materials (per 100 feet of bufferyard
length), the bufferyard width, and required structure type combination by selecting
the desired alternative bufferyard type.
Editor's Note: Tables 8 through 12 are included at the end of this chapter.
Calculate the actual number of plants required by selecting the minimum number of
plant materials (per 100 feet of bufferyard length) from the alternatives indicated on
the applicable Tables 8 to 12 and multiply by the hundreds of feet of bufferyard to be
planted.
Limitations on bufferyard use. A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation. It may contain
pedestrian or bike trails provided that:
No plant material is eliminated;
The total width of the bufferyard is maintained; and
All other regulations of this chapter are met. In no event, however, shall swimming pools,
decks, drives, curbing, stormwater detention/retention ponds, tennis courts, sports fields,
golf courses, parking lots, or other similar uses (as determined by the Plan Commission)
be permitted in bufferyards.
Table of required bufferyards between zoning districts. The minimum required bufferyard
intensity factor for bufferyards between zoning districts set forth in Table 7 refers to the
bufferyard width and plant unit standards set forth in Table 8 through Table 12 of this chapter.
Bufferyards are required between adjacent zoning districts. The abbreviations used in Table 7
represent the City of Burlington Zoning District designations used throughout this chapter.[6]
Editor's Note: Tables 7 through 12 are included at the end of this chapter.
Minimum required bufferyard width and plant material standards. Tables 8 through 12 set forth
the minimum bufferyard width and plant material standards required for achieving required
bufferyard intensity levels. Tables 8 through 12 are designed so as to allow for choice from a
variety of alternative bufferyard widths and general landscape plant material types in order to
meet the required bufferyard intensity levels required elsewhere in this section.
Minimum plant material standards. All new landscape plant material shall meet those
standards set forth under the requirements of § 315-48D(6) of this chapter.

parking lot, street, or pedestrian area lighting) for illumination.
Internal illuminated message. The sign is made of metal, wood, or other material that is not
translucent, and the message is cut out of the material and replaced with translucent material. The

Backlighting. The message is raised beyond the sign's background and the lighting illuminates the
sign from behind in the form of backlighting.
Shielded spotlight. The sign is lighted by spotlights specifically directed at it. The spotlights are
fully shielded so that they are not visible from streets or adjoining property. Any spotlights
permitted to illuminate signs shall be shielded such that their light source cannot be seen from
adjoining roads.
Electronic signs. Electronic signs meeting the requirements of this subsection are permitted only in
the B-1, B-2, and B2A Zoning Districts and as a conditional use in the I-1 Zoning District..

not considered business signage.
Wall and fascia (including transoms) sign placement not to visually obscure architectural

extend only over public rights-of-way occupied by pedestrian sidewalks subject to the following:

Maximum area of a projecting and hanging sign. The maximum cumulative permitted area
allowed for all projecting or hanging signs on a structure in the HPO District shall not exceed

has two street-facing facades, consideration to a second sign will be given. The sign dimension
can mirror what is allowable on the primary side, if the second side is equal to or larger in size

The design, logo, or wording of the sign is altered.
The sign is determined to be abandoned under the provisions of this chapter.

either the sign owner or the owner of the property upon which the sign is placed within 30 days
after written notice from the Zoning Administrator of the City of Burlington. Upon failure to comply
with this notice, the Zoning Administrator, City Attorney, or Common Council shall cause a citation
to be issued and may seek from the court an order removing the sign at the cost of the owner of
the sign and/or the property owner of the property upon which the sign is placed. Further, a per
diem fine shall be imposed for each day after the thirty-day notice expires, as provided in § 315-
136, against the owner of the sign and/or the property owner of the property upon which the sign
is placed. Any fine imposed shall become a lien on that person's property named in the citation or
order and shall automatically be placed on the tax roll as a special charge against that person's
property.

Where the ambient sound level influences a measurement at a property boundary,
such sound will be accounted for by applying the following correction factors:
Table 2
If the ambient sound level is less
than the sound source by: Add the following to the sound limit:
0 to 1 dBA 3 dBA
2 to 3 dBA 2 dBA
4 to 9 dBA 1 dBA
If the ambient sound level is greater than the sound limit, the sound source shall not
be allowed to exceed the ambient level.
"Ambient sound level" means the sound pressure level of all-encompassing sounds
associated with a given environment, being a composite of many sounds. For the
purposes of this chapter, such term is the sound pressure level exceeded 90% of the
time, based upon a measurement of not less than 10 minutes and excluding the
alleged offensive sounds.
Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
Any sounds allowed under other provisions of the City of Burlington Code of Municipal
Ordinances. This shall expressly include, but not be limited to, sounds allowed under
§ 219-3 and/or this Chapter 315 of the Code of Municipal Ordinances (such as, but not
limited to, a variance and/or a conditional use permit).
Any sounds generated in a manufacturing, business, and/or quarrying/extractive district
that do not comply with the sound levels of this chapter, but which are nonetheless still
approved by the City of Burlington Common Council, because the noncompliant sound is,
as determined by the Common Council, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) necessary
for the conducting of the lawful activities otherwise allowed on the site in question, but (ii)
such noncompliant sound is not reasonably capable of being made compliant for
technical and/or economic reasons, and (iii) such noncompliant sound is not contrary to
the public safety, health, and welfare of the community. The approval of the Common
Council of the noncompliant sound may be subject to such conditions and/or limitations
as the Common Council may determine.
Method of measurement.
Equipment. Sound measurement shall be made with a sound level meter manufactured
according to the specifications of the American National Standards Institute, USA Standard
Specifications for General Purpose Sound Level Meters and Preferred Center Frequencies for
Acoustical Measurements, or any subsequent nationally adopted standards superseding the
above standards.
Location and interpretation. Sound measurement shall be made at the nearest lot line of
premises from which sound complaints are received and shall be made at a height of at least
three feet above the ground and at least three feet away from walls, barriers, obstructions or
sound reflective surfaces. Where the nature of the sound level permits, the slow response
setting shall be used to obtain the sound level on the sound level meter.
Application for exemption stays prosecution. If a person or entity is given a citation in the City of
Burlington Municipal Court system for a violation of this chapter, and if that person/entity so cited
applies for an exemption from the said sound violation under above Subsection A(2)(b) of this
ordinance within 15 calendar days after the date of the issued citation, the action in the Municipal
Court shall be stayed until the Common Council makes its determination under above Subsection
A(2)(b). If the Common Council approves the application filed under Subsection A(2)(b) for the

allowance of the noncompliant sound (whether with or without conditions or limitations), the legal
proceeding in the Municipal Court shall then be dismissed.
§ 315-96. Odors.
[Amended 7-5-1994 by Ord. No. 1477(6)]
No activity shall emit any odorous matter of such nature or quantity as to be offensive, obnoxious, or
unhealthful outside its premises. The guide for determining odor measurement and control shall be
§ NR 429.03, Wis. Admin. Code, and amendments thereto.
§ 315-97. Radioactivity and electrical disturbances.
No activity shall emit radioactivity or electrical disturbances outside its premises that are dangerous or
adversely affect the use of neighboring premises.
§ 315-98. Vibration.
No activity in any district shall emit vibrations which are discernible without instruments outside its
premises. No activity shall emit vibrations which exceed the following displacement measured with a
three-component measuring system:
Displacement

§ 315-106. Findings.
[Amended 11-9-2006 by Ord. No. 1808(12)]
Variances. No variance to the provisions of this chapter shall be granted by the Board unless it
finds beyond a reasonable doubt that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates
in the minutes of its proceedings:
Preservation of intent. No variance shall be granted that is not consistent with the purpose
and intent of the regulations for the district in which the development is located. No variance
shall have the effect of permitting a use in any district that is not a stated permitted use,
accessory use, or conditional use in that particular district; provided, however, that a use
variance may be granted if the district regulations deprive the owner of any reasonable use of
the property.
[Amended 8-4-2009 by Ord. No. 1886(7)]
Exceptional circumstances. There must be exceptional, extraordinary, or unusual
circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use, or intended use that
do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district, and the granting of the
variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should
be changed.
Economic hardship and self-imposed hardship not grounds for variance. No variance shall be
granted solely on the basis of economic gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be
considered as grounds for the granting of a variance.
Preservation of property rights. Such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district
and same vicinity.
Absence of detriment. The variance will not create substantial detriment to adjacent property
and will not materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the
public interest.
(Reserved)[1]
Editor's Note: Former Subsection A(6), regarding additional requirements in floodplain
districts, was repealed 3-6-2012 by Ord. No. 1943(20).
Boundary disputes.
Floodplain disputes. The following procedure shall be used by the Board in hearing disputes
concerning floodplain district boundaries:
If a floodplain district boundary is established by approximate or detailed floodplain
studies, the flood elevations or profiles shall prevail in locating the boundary. If none
exist, other evidence may be examined.

Preservation Overlay District and will materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and
spirit of the intent of the HPO Historic Preservation Overlay District as specifically set
forth and enumerated in § 315-42A(1) through (9) and B of this chapter, the adopted

the developer fails to do so after such notice by the City, the Common Council of the
City may cause the building to be razed and the land to be restored and shall assess
the cost against the real estate as a special charge. The City may, as a condition of
the conditional use permit, demand a performance bond to ensure fulfillment of this

against the property. In conjunction with the performance of said landscape plant
replacement, the City of Burlington shall have full access to both the tower site and all
access and/or utility easements associated with said facilities.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensing required. No construction of the
communications tower(s), antennas, and/or associated accessory structures and facilities
shall be commenced until all applicable FCC licenses have been granted and copies of
said FCC licenses have been furnished the City of Burlington.
Minimum setback requirements. No portion of any wireless communications towers,
antennas, and associated accessory structures and facilities shall overhang any property
line. There shall be a setback from any adjacent property lines, right-of-way lines, and
overhead power lines of sufficient radius around the tower or alternative tower structure
(as measured from the extremities of the tower base or alternative tower structure base)
equal to the tower height or alternative tower structure height (as applicable and as set
forth in the conditional use permit) plus 25 feet so that its collapse will be entirely
contained on the property. This standard may be modified to a lesser requirement if the
applicant submits written evidence from a structural professional engineer licensed in the
State of Wisconsin which indicates that the tower is so designed that the collapse of the
tower would require a lesser setback in order to entirely contain its collapse on the
property upon which it is placed. All setbacks shall be measured from the base of the
tower or alternative tower structure closest to the applicable property line. Tower or
alternative tower structure setback requirements may be waived by the City Plan
Commission only under the following circumstances as determined by the City Plan
Commission:
The communications antennas and associated accessory structures and facilities
are proposed to be located on an existing, legally established tower or alternative
tower structure, building or accessory structure; and
Overall, the reduced setback enables the further mitigation of adverse visual and
other environmental impacts than would otherwise be possible.
Minimum distance of communication towers from residential structures.
Regardless of the zoning district in which a communication tower is located, the
tower shall be at least 200 feet from the nearest residential lot line, except that the
tower shall be at least 250 feet from the nearest residential lot line of any singlefamily
residence.
Distances shall be measured from the center of the base of the communication
tower to the residential lot line.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, no communication tower
other than a monopole (freestanding) tower shall be located in any location adjacent
to a residential lot, except that a communication tower necessary for provision of an
essential service by a public utility adjacent to a residential lot is not limited to a
monopole if the entity with the authority to approve the site plan determines that a
different type of tower is necessary for provision of the essential service.
Nonconforming communication towers. To the extent set forth herein, the restrictions on
nonconforming uses and structures contained in Article VIII are modified and
supplemented by this subsection. Legal nonconforming communication towers or
antennas that are damaged or destroyed may be rebuilt and all such towers or antennas
may be modified or replaced without meeting the minimum distance requirements
specified within this § 315-130, provided that the replacement structure will not be placed
less of a minimum distance than the original structure. The type, height, and location of

the communication tower shall be deemed abandoned as specified in Subsection B(2)(k)
hereinabove.
Historic Preservation Overlay District. Any application for a communication antenna on or
within 250 feet of property designated as Historic Preservation Overlay District shall
request a certificate of appropriateness (COA) from the City's Historic Preservation
Commission. A denial of a COA may be cause for denial of a conditional use permit.
Facilities exempt from this subsection. The following wireless communications towers,
antennas, and associated accessory structures and facilities are exempt from the
provisions of this subsection:
A ground- or building-mounted receive-only radio or television antenna which does
not exceed 40 feet in height and which is used solely by the occupants of a dwelling
located in a residential zoning district.
A ground- or building-mounted receive-only radio or television satellite dish that does
not exceed one meter in diameter in any zoning district.

proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring uses, potential impacts upon neighboring
uses, utilization of landscaping and open space, off-street parking and loading areas, driveway
locations, loading and unloading in the case of commercial and industrial uses, highway access,
traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and water systems, and the proposed
operation.
Principles and standards of review. The Plan Commission will approve said site plan(s) only after
determining that:
Conformity of use to zoning district. The proposed use(s) conforms to the uses permitted as
either a permitted use or conditional use (whichever is applicable) in the zoning district.
Dimensional requirements. The dimensional arrangement of buildings and structures
conforms to the required area, yard, setback, and height restrictions of this chapter.
Use and design provisions. The proposed use conforms to all use and design provisions and
requirements (if any) as found in this chapter for the specified uses.
Relation to existing and proposed streets and highways. There is a proper relationship
between the existing and proposed streets and highways within the vicinity of the project in
order to assure the safety and convenience of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and, in the case
of arterial streets and highways not under the jurisdiction of the City of Burlington, that the
applicable highway authority (county, state, or federal) has been contacted and the needed
permits have been obtained and submitted to the City of Burlington for review.
Impacts on surrounding uses. The proposed on-site buildings, structures, and entryways are
situated and designed to minimize adverse effects upon owners and occupants of adjacent
and surrounding properties by providing for adequate sunlight, design of ingress/egress and
interior/exterior traffic flow, stormwater drainage, erosion, grading, lighting, and parking, as
specified by this chapter or any other codes or laws.
Natural resource features protection. Natural features of the landscape are retained to
enhance the development on the site, or where they furnish a barrier or buffer between the
project and adjoining properties used for dissimilar purposes, or where they assist in
preserving the general safety, health, welfare, and appearance of the neighborhood.
Required landscaping and landscape bufferyards. Adverse effects of the proposed
development and activities upon adjoining residents or owners are minimized by design and
installation of landscape bufferyards to provide for appropriate screening, fencing, or
landscaping as required by this chapter and, where required, a landscape plan meeting the
requirements set forth in § 315-138 has also been submitted for Plan Commission review and
approval.
Provision of emergency vehicle accessibility. Land, buildings, and structures are readily
accessible to emergency vehicles and the handicapped.
Building location. No building shall be permitted to be sited in a manner which would
unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the beauty of the area, particularly insofar as it
would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in the area, or which would
unnecessarily have an adverse effect on the beauty and general enjoyment of existing
structures on adjoining properties.
Location and design of loading facilities. No loading facility shall be permitted to be designed
or sited in a manner which would unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the beauty of
the area, particularly insofar as it would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land
in the area, or which would unnecessarily have an adverse effect on the beauty and general
enjoyment of the existing structures on adjoining properties.
