3.24 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF TOWN OFFICIALS.
1. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees
be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and
19 | P a g e
policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be
used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government.
In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established in this ordinance a Code of Ethics for
all Town of Beloit officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid,
including members of boards, committees and commissions of the Town, as well as any
individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination
papers with the Town.
2. The purpose of this Ethics Code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for
all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible
with the best interests of the Town of Beloit and by directing disclosure by such officials and
employees of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the Town. The Town
Board believes that a Code of Ethics for guidance of elected and appointed officials and
employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public
responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the
faith and confidence of the citizens of this Town in their elected and appointed officials and
employees. The Town Board hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed Town official
and employee holds his or her position as a public trust, and any intentional effort to realize
substantial personal gain through official conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions
and purpose of this Ethics Code and such rules and regulations as may be established are
hereby declared to be in the best interest of the Town of Beloit.

service or thing of value.
c. An official or employee is not to accept hospitality if, after consideration of the
surrounding circumstances, it could reasonably be concluded that such hospitality would

immediate family, was a Town official or employee. Participation in celebrations, grand
22 | P a g e
openings, open houses, informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this
prohibition. This paragraph further shall not be construed to prevent candidates for

individual discloses to the Town Board that such interest exists.
6. Contracts with the Town. No Town official or employee who, in his capacity as such officer or
employee, participates in the making of a contract in which he has a private pecuniary
interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring

5.13 PAWN BROKER AND SECOND-HAND DEALERS LICENSE.
1. Purpose.
a. Pawnbrokers and secondhand articles dealers provide an opportunity for the commission
of crimes and concealment of crimes because pawnshops and secondhand articles
dealers have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly. The
Board of Supervisors finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in
transactions involving these businesses. The Board of Supervisors further finds that
pawnshops and secondhand goods dealers have surpassed the Town’s current ability to
effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to them. The purpose of this
ordinance is to prevent pawnshops and secondhand articles dealers from being used to
facilitate the commission of crimes, to prevent youth from being involved in pawn and
secondhand articles industries, and to assure that they comply with basic consumer
protection standards, thereby protecting property values, preventing blight, and
protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens. This ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 134.71(14), Wis. Stats.
b. This ordinance implements and establishes the required use of an automated pawnshop
and secondhand articles dealer system (APS) to help the Police Department better
regulate current and future pawnshops and secondhand articles dealers to decrease and
stabilize costs associated with the regulation of pawnshops and secondhand articles
dealers and to increase identification of criminal activities in pawnshops and secondhand
articles dealers through the timely collection and sharing of transaction information.

7.01 AUTHORITY.
1. This ordinance is adopted under the authority granted by Section 60.627, WI. Stats. This
ordinance supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under Section 60.627,
WI. Stats., that relate to construction site erosion control and Stormwater management
regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Section 60.627, WI. Stats. Section 60.627, WI.
Stats., applies to this ordinance and to any amendments to this ordinance.
2. The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers
of the same governing body.
3. The Town of Beloit Board of Supervisors hereby designates the Department of Community
Development to administer the provisions of this ordinance.
4. The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent erosion and sediment
control requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
a. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals,
including those authorized under Sections 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
b. Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources under Section NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
7.02 FINDINGS OF FACT. The Town of Beloit Board of Supervisors acknowledges that runoff from land
disturbing construction activities carries a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to
the waters of the state in the Town of Beloit. The Town further acknowledges that uncontrolled,
post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and
general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural
resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
1. Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed
scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing
stream temperature.
2. Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water
supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy
metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
3. Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.
4. Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
5. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,
drainage ways, and other minor draining facilities.
7.03 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
1. It is the purpose of this ordinance to maintain safe and healthful conditions; prevent and
control water pollution; prevent and control soil erosion and sediment discharge; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and
3 | P a g e
land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth by
minimizing the amount of sediment and other pollutants carried off by or discharged from
land disturbing activity to waters of the state in the Town of Beloit. It is also the intent of this
ordinance to establish long-term, post construction runoff management requirements that
will diminish the threats to public health as stated herein, specifically:
a. Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
b. Prevent and control adverse effects of Stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion;
prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds; fish and aquatic life;
control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and
scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
c. Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water
bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; and control increases in scouring and
transportation of particulate matter.
d. Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect
the waters of the state.
2. It is the intent of the Town of Beloit that this ordinance regulates construction and postconstruction
Stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This ordinance may be applied on
a site-by-site basis. The Town of Beloit recognizes, however, that the preferred method of
achieving the Stormwater performance standards set forth in this ordinance is through the
preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level Stormwater management
plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such
plans may prescribe regional Stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be
designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to the waters of the state.
Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under
Sections 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional Stormwater management measures have been
approved by the Town of Beloit, it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved
Stormwater management plan be used to identify construction and post-construction
management measures acceptable for the community.

ii. This subsection of the ordinance does not apply to any of the following:
A. A post-construction site where the discharge is directly into a lake over five
thousand (5,000) acres or a stream or river segment draining more than five
hundred (500) square miles.
B. Except as provided under Section 7.10 (3), a redevelopment post construction
site.
C. An in-fill development area less than five (5) acres.
c. Infiltration.
i. Best Management Practices. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained
to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following or to the maximum extent
practicable:
A. Low imperviousness. For development, up to forty percent (40%) connected
imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and low density residential
development, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least ninety percent (90%) of the
pre- development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
13 | P a g e
requirement, no more than one percent of the post-construction site is
required as an effective infiltration area.
B. Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than forty percent
(40%) and up to eighty percent (80%) connected imperviousness, such as
medium and high density residential, multi-family development, industrial
and institutional development, and office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff
volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the pre-development infiltration volume, based
on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate
infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent (2%)
of the post- construction site is required as an effective infiltration area.
C. High imperviousness. For development with more than eighty percent (80%)
connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip malls, shopping centers,
and commercial downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the
post-development infiltration volume shall be at least sixty percent (60%) of
the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet
this requirement, no more than two percent (2%) of the post-construction
site is required as an effective infiltration area.
ii. Pre-development. The pre-development condition shall be the same as specified
in Table 2 of the Peak Discharge section of this ordinance.
iii. Source Areas.
A. Prohibitions. Runoff from the following areas may not be infiltrated and may
not qualify as contributing to meeting the requirements of this ordinance
unless demonstrated to meet the conditions identified in Section 7.10 (4)(c)6:
B. Areas associated with a tier 1 industrial facility identified in Section NR 216.21
(2)(a), including storage, loading and parking. Rooftops may be infiltrated
with the concurrence of the regulatory authority.
C. Storage and loading areas of a tier 2 industrial facility identified in Section NR
216.21 (2)(b).
D. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Runoff from rooftops of fueling and
vehicle maintenance areas may be infiltrated with the concurrence of the
regulatory authority.
iv. Exemptions. Runoff from the following areas may be credited toward meeting
the requirement when infiltrated, but the decision to infiltrate runoff from these
source areas is optional:
A. Parking areas and access roads less than five thousand (5,000) square feet for
commercial development.
B. Parking areas and access roads less than five thousand (5,000) square feet for
industrial development not subject to the Prohibitions under par a. except as
provided under Section 7.10 (3), redevelopment post-construction sites.
C. In-fill development areas less than five (5) acres.

(100) feet downgradient of direct conduits to groundwater.
14 | P a g e
B. Areas within four hundred (400) feet of a community water system well as
specified in Section NR 811.16 (4) or within the separation distances listed in
Section NR 812.08 for any private well or non-community well for runoff
infiltrated from commercial, including multi-family residential, industrial and
institutional land uses or regional devices for one- and two-family residential
development.
C. Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in Section NR 720.03(2),
are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur.
ii. Separation distances.
A. Infiltration practices shall be located so that the characteristics of the soil and
the separation distance between the bottom of the infiltration system and
the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock are in
accordance with Table 3:

bottom of the infiltration system is less than 0.6 inches per hour using
a scientifically credible field test method.
II. Where the least permeable soil horizon to five (5) feet below the
proposed bottom of the infiltration system using the U.S.
Department of Agriculture method of soils analysis is one of the
following: sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, loam, sandy clay, silty
clay, or clay.
e. Alternate Use. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet flushing,
laundry, or irrigation or storage on green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff
is captured permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate use shall be given equal
credit toward the infiltration volume required by this ordinance.
f. Groundwater Standards.
i. Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this ordinance shall, to the
extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants
15 | P a g e
infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive
action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Chapter NR
140. However, if site specific information indicates that compliance with a
preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed
or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable.
ii. Notwithstanding Par. i., the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the
enforcement standard at the point of standards application.
g. Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot
runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial and
institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be
designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance
and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with Subd. f. Pretreatment options may
include, but are not limited to, oil and grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration,
filtration, swales or filter strips.
h. Maximum Extent Practicable. Where the conditions of Subd. 3. and 4. limit or restrict the
use of infiltration practices, the performance standard of Section 7.10 (4)(c) shall be met
to the maximum extent practicable.
5. Protective Areas.
a. Definition. In this ordinance, “protective area” means an area of land that commences at
the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of
wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from
the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface.
However, in this ordinance, “protective area” does not include any area of land adjacent
to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, so that runoff cannot enter the enclosure
at this location.
i. For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, seventy five
(75) feet.
ii. For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-
minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever is more
current, fifty (50) feet.
iii. For lakes, fifty (50) feet.
iv. For wetlands not subject to Par. v. or vi., fifty (50) feet.
v. For highly susceptible wetlands, seventy five (75) feet. Highly susceptible
wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open and
coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood swamps,
and ephemeral ponds.
vi. For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent (10%) of the average wetland width,
but no less than ten (10) feet nor more than thirty (30) feet. Less susceptible
wetlands include: degraded wetland dominated by invasive species such as reed
canary grass; cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged material or
fill material disposal sites that take on the attributes of a wetland.
vii. In Pars. iv. to vi., determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to
wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of
the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in Section NR 103.03.
viii. Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance with Section NR
103.08 (1m). This paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have been
completely filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations.
16 | P a g e
The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in compliance with
all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland
boundary delineation after a fill has been placed. Where there is a legally
authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that
location.
ix. For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than one hundred
thirty (130) acres, ten (10) feet.
x. Notwithstanding Pars. i. to ix., the greatest protective area width shall apply
where rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands are contiguous.
b. Applicability. This ordinance applies to post-construction sites located within a protective
area, except those areas exempted pursuant to Subd. d.
c. Requirements. The following requirements shall be met:
i. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area entirely or to the
maximum extent practicable. If there is no practical alternative to locating an
impervious surface in the protective area, the storm water management plan
shall contain a written, site-specific explanation.
ii. Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area,
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of seventy percent (70%) or
greater shall be established and maintained where no impervious surface is
present. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient
to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat, and filtering of
pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative
materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as
necessary to prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows
occur.
iii. BMPs such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention ponds, that are designed to
control pollutants from non-point sources, may be located in the protective area.
d. Exemptions. This ordinance does not apply to any of the following:
i. Except as provided in this ordinance, redevelopment post-construction sites.
ii. In-fill development areas less than five (5) acres.
iii. Structures that cross or access surface water such as boat landings, bridges, and
culverts.
iv. Structures constructed in accordance with Section 59.692 (1v), Wis. Stats.
v. Areas of post-construction sites from which the runoff does not enter the surface
water, including wetlands, without first being treated by a BMP to meet the local
ordinance requirements for total suspended solids and peak flow reduction,
except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank
stability.
6. Fueling and Maintenance Areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall have BMPs
designed, installed, and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, so that the runoff that
enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen, or to the maximum extent
practicable.
7. General Considerations for Stormwater Management Efforts. The following considerations
shall be observed in on-site and off-site runoff management:
17 | P a g e
a. Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions,
native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be
preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this ordinance.
b. Emergency overland flow for all storm water facilities shall be provided to prevent
exceeding the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and prevent endangerment
of downstream property or public safety.
8. BMP Location.
a. To comply with the performance standards required under Section 7.10 of this ordinance,
BMPs may be located onKsite or oLKsite as part of a regional storm water device, pracMce
or system, but shall be installed in accordance with Section NR 151.003, Wis. Adm. Code.
b. The Town of Beloit may approve off-site management measures provided that all of the
following conditions are met:
i. The Town of Beloit determines that the post-construction runoff is covered by a
storm water management system plan that is approved by the Town of Beloit and
that contains management requirements consistent with the purpose and intent
of this ordinance.
ii. The off-site facility meets all of the following conditions:
A. The facility is in place.
B. The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm
water control equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by

C. The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term
operation and maintenance.
D. Where a regional treatment option exists such that the Town of Beloit
exempts the applicant from all or part of the minimum on-site storm
water management requirements, the applicant shall be required to pay
a fee in an amount determined in negotiation with the Town. In
determining the fee for post-construction runoff, the Town of Beloit shall
consider an equitable distribution of the cost for land, engineering
design, construction, and maintenance of the regional treatment option.
9. Additional Requirements. The Town of Beloit may establish storm water management
requirements more stringent than those set forth in this ordinance if the Town or its designee
determines that the requirements are needed to control storm water quantity or control
flooding, comply with federally approved total maximum daily load requirements, or control
pollutants associated with existing development or redevelopment.

7. Clerk to Inscribe Final Approval on Plat Map. If the original of the final subdivision plat or
certified survey map has been filed with another approving authority, the divider may file a
true copy of such land division in lieu of the original. However, before approval of the Town
Board will be inscribed on the original of the final plat or map, the surveyor or the developer
shall certify the respects in which the original of the final land division differs from the true
copy and all modifications must be first approved by the Town Board. Any additional security

facilities necessary to serve the additional people brought in the community as a result of
subdivision activity may be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs created
by the development.
a. Reservation of Parks and Other Sites. Where a proposed park, playground, school site, or
other public site as shown on the Master Plan, Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan,
or Official Map is embraced in part or in whole by the boundary of a proposed subdivision
and such public sites are not dedicated, such public ground shall be reserved and no

dwelling units planned to occupy the site or permitted by the zoning ordinance,
with the area of dedication to be not less than eight percent (8%) of the total area
developed.
ii. Land Suitability. Lands to be dedicated shall be suitable for the public use for
which they are proposed. Each dedication shall be of suitable size, dimension,
topography, and general character, and shall have a minimum of a twenty foot
(20’) wide service access. In general, land dedicated for recreation purposes shall
have an area of at least two (2) acres. The Plan Commission may require that the
dedication be located at a suitable place on the edge of the subdivision so that
additional land may be added when the adjacent land is subdivided. Dedicated
parkland must be relatively level outside of floodplains and wetlands and suitable
for playground and playfield improvements. Acceptance of dedicated land shall
be at the discretion of the Town Board, after conferring with the Plan
Commission. The area dedicated shall be seeded according to Town of Beloit
specifications.
iii. Parkland Shown on Final Plat. The area shall be shown and marked on the plat
“Dedicated to the Public for Park and/or Recreation Purposes.” The developer

health nuisances and the protection of the public health and welfare and may, where appropriate,
require the issuance of licenses and permits. All such regulations shall have the same effect as

issue notices for removal of noxious weeds by mail to the owner/occupants of such lands
containing noxious weeds. The owner/occupant shall have five (5) days from the receipt of

of Public Works will be designated by the Weed Commissioner to do what is necessary to
remove all noxious weeds with the expense thereof, including the cost of billing and other
necessary administrative costs, to be collected as a special charge on the effected property’s
tax bill pursuant to Chapter 74, Wis. Stats.
9.05 REGULATION OF NATURAL LAWNS.
1. Natural Lawns Defined. Natural lawn as used in this ordinance shall include common species
of grass and wild flowers native to North America which are designed and purposely cultivated
to exceed eight inches (8”) in height from the ground. Specifically excluded in natural lawns
are the noxious grasses and weeds identified in this ordinance. The growth of a natural lawn
in excess of ten inches (10”) in height from the ground surface shall be prohibited within the
3 | P a g e
Town of Beloit corporate limits unless a Natural Lawn Management Plan is approved and a
permit is issued by the Town as set forth in this ordinance; exempted from this ordinance are
agricultural parcels of over two (2) acres. Natural lawns shall not contain litter or debris and
shall not harbor undesirable wildlife.
2. Natural Lawn Management Plan Defined.
a. Natural Lawn Management Plan as used in this ordinance shall mean a written plan
relating to the management and maintenance of a lawn which contains a legal description
of lawn upon which the planted grass will exceed eight inches (8”) in length, a statement
of intent and purpose for the lawn, a detailed description of vegetation types, plants and
plant succession involved and the specific management and maintenance techniques to
be employed.
b. Property owners who wish to plant and cultivate a natural lawn must submit their written
plan and related information to the Town. “Property Owner” shall be defined to include
the legal title holder and/or the beneficial owner of any such lot according to most current
Town records. Natural Lawn Management Plans shall only indicate the planting and
cultivating of natural lawns on property legally owned by the property owner.
c. Applicants are strictly prohibited from developing a natural lawn on any Town-owned
property including street right-of-way. This shall include at a minimum property located
between the sidewalk and the street or a strip not less than ten feet (10’) adjacent to the
street where there is no sidewalk whether the area is under public or private ownership.
d. In addition, natural lawns shall not be permitted within ten feet (10’) of the abutting
property owner’s property unless waived in writing by the abutting property owner on
the side so affected. Such waiver is to be affixed to the Lawn Management Plan. Such
waiver may be revoked, in writing, by the abutting property owner at a later time, a copy
to be filed with the permittee and the Town Clerk.
e. Any subsequent property owner who abuts an approved natural lawn may revoke the
waiver thereby requiring the owner of the natural lawn to remove the natural lawn that
is located in the ten foot (10’) section abutting the neighboring property owner. Such
revocation shall be put in writing and presented to the Town Clerk by the subsequent
abutting property owner. Upon receiving the written request to revoke the original
waiver, the Town Administrator shall contact the owner of the approved natural lawn and
direct the owner to remove the natural lawn located in the ten foot (10’) section abutting
the neighboring property. The Town Administrator shall revise the approved Natural
Lawn Management Permit accordingly. The owner of the approved natural lawn shall be
required to remove the ten foot (10’) section abutting the neighboring property within
twenty (20) days of receipt of the written notification from the Town provided the
notification is received sometime between May 1 and November 1. Property owners who
receive notification from the Town between November 1 and April 30 shall be required
to remove the ten foot (10’) section abutting the neighboring property no later than May
20 following receipt of the notification.
3. Application Process.
a. Property owners interested in applying for permission to establish a natural lawn shall file
an application with the Town Clerk. The completed application shall include a Natural
Lawn Management Plan. Upon submitting a completed application, a Twenty-Five Dollar
($25.00) non-refundable filing fee will be assessed by the Town. Upon receiving payment,
copies of the completed application shall be mailed by the Town to each of the owners of
4 | P a g e
the property situated wholly or in part within three hundred feet (300’) of the boundaries
of the properties for which the application is made. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of
mailing the copies of the complete application to the neighboring property owners the
Town receives written objections from fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the neighboring
property owners, the Town Clerk shall deny the application. Neighboring property owners
shall be defined as all those property owners who are located within three hundred feet
(300’) of the proposed natural lawn site.
b. If the property owner’s application is in full compliance with the Natural Lawn
Management Plan requirements and less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the abutting
property owners provide written objections, the Town Clerk shall issue permission to
install a natural lawn. Such permit shall be valid for two (2) years. Permit renewal shall
follow the procedures in this ordinance.
4. Application for Appeal. The property owner may appeal the Clerk’s decision to deny the
natural lawn permit request to the Town Board at an open meeting. All applications for appeal
shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days of the notice of denial of the Natural Lawn
Management Plan. The decision rendered by the Town Board shall be final and binding.
5. Safety Precautions for Natural Grass Areas.
a. When, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, the presence of a natural lawn may constitute a
fire or safety hazard due to weather and/or other conditions, the Fire Chief may order the
cutting of natural lawns to a safe condition. As a condition of receiving approval of the
natural lawn permit, the property owner shall be required to cut the natural lawn within
three (3) days upon receiving written direction from the Fire Chief.
b. Natural lawns shall not be removed through the process of burning unless stated and
approved as one of the management and maintenance techniques in the Lawn
Management Plan and the appropriate Town open burning permits have been obtained.
The Fire Chief shall review all requests to burn natural lawns and shall determine if
circumstances are correct and all applicable requirements have been fulfilled to insure
public safety. Burning of natural lawns shall be strictly prohibited unless a written permit
to burn is issued by the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief shall establish a written list of
requirements for considering each request to burn natural lawns, thereby ensuring public
safety. In addition, the property owner requesting permission to burn the natural lawn
shall produce evidence of property damage and liability insurance identifying the Town
as a party insured. A minimum amount of acceptable insurance shall be Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00).
c. Revocation of an Approved Natural Lawn Management Plan Permit. The Weed
Commissioner shall have the authority to revoke an approved Natural Lawn Management
Plan Permit if the owner fails to maintain the natural lawn or comply with the provisions
set forth in this ordinance. Notice of intent to revoke an approved Natural Lawn
Management Plan Permit shall be appealable to the Town Board. All applications for
appeal shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the written Notice
of Intent to revoke the approved Lawn Management Plan. Failure to file an application
for appeal within the fifteen (15) calendar days shall result in the revoking of the Natural
Lawn Management Plan Permit. All written applications for appeal filed within the fifteen
(15) calendar day requirement shall be reviewed by the Town Board in an open meeting.
The decision rendered by the Town Board shall be final and binding.

6. Public Nuisance Defined-Abatement after Notice.
a. The growth of a natural lawn as defined in this ordinance shall be considered a public
nuisance unless a Natural Lawn Management Plan has been filed and approved and a
permit is issued by the Town as set forth in this ordinance. Violators shall be served with
a notice of public nuisance by certified mail to the last known mailing address of the
property owner.
b. If the person so served with a notice of public nuisance violation does not abate the
nuisance within ten (10) days, the Code Compliance Officer may proceed to abate such
nuisance, keeping an account of the expense of the abatement and such expense shall be
charged to and paid by such property owner. Notice of the bill for abatement of the public
nuisance shall be mailed to the owner of the premises and shall be payable within ten
(10) calendar days from receipt thereof. Within sixty (60) days after such costs and
expenses are incurred and remain unpaid, the Town Finance Director/Treasurer shall
enter those charges onto the tax roll as a special tax as provided by Section 66.0809, Wis.
Stats.
c. The failure of the Town Finance Director/Treasurer to record such claim or to mail such
notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to place
the Town expense on the tax rolls for unpaid bills for abating the public nuisance as
provided for in this ordinance.
7. Penalty.
a. Any person, firm or corporation which does not abate the nuisance within the required
time period or who otherwise violates the provisions of this ordinance shall be subject to
the general penalty found in Chapter 1 of these Code of Ordinances.
b. In addition to any penalties herein provided, the Town may issue stop work orders upon
owners of lots where work is unfinished under a previously issued building permit for any
violation of this ordinance.
9.06 REGULATION OF LENGTH OF LAWN AND GRASSES.
1. Purpose. This ordinance is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with
lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the Town of
Beloit.
2. Public Nuisance Declared. The Town Board finds that lawns, grasses and noxious weeds on
lots or parcels of land within the Town of Beloit which exceed eight (8) inches in length
adversely affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and
other discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris
can be hidden in the grass, interferes with the public convenience and adversely affects
property values of other land within the Town. For that reason, any non-agricultural lawn,
grass or weed on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds eight (8) inches in length is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance, except for property located in a designated floodplain area
and/or wetland area or where the lawn, grass or weed is part of a natural lawn approved
pursuant to Section 9.05 (1).
3. Nuisances Prohibited. No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public nuisance as
defined in Section 9.05 (2) to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him/her within
the Town.
6 | P a g e
4. Inspection. The Code Compliance Officer or his/her designee shall inspect or cause to be
inspected all premises and places within the Town to determine whether any public nuisance
as defined in Section 9.06(2) exists.
5. Abatement of Nuisance. If the Code Compliance Officer shall determine with reasonable
certainty that any public nuisance as defined in Section 9.06(2) above exists, the Code
Compliance Officer shall immediately cause written notice to be served that the Town
proposes to have the lot grass or lawn cut to conform to this Section 9.05. The notice shall be
sent to the owner by first class mail at the owner’s last known address as shown on the most
recent property tax bill for the property affected by the notice.
6. Due Process Hearing. If the owner believes that his/her grasses or weeds are not a nuisance,
he/she may request a hearing before the Town Board. The request for said hearing must be
made in writing to the Town Clerk’s office within the five (5) days set forth in the Code
Compliance Officer’s notice. When a hearing is requested by the owner of the property, a
hearing by the Town Board shall be held at the next Town Board meeting after the date of the
owner’s request. The property in question will not be mowed by the Town until the hearing
is held by the Town Board. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his/her
attorney, may present witnesses in his/her own behalf and may cross examine witnesses
presented by the Town as well as subpoena witnesses for his/her own case. At the close of
the hearing, the Town Board shall make its determination in writing specifying its findings,
facts and conclusions. If the Town Board determines that a public nuisance did exist, the Town
Board shall order the Department of Public Works to mow the property in questions unless
the property has been mowed by the owner within forty-eight (48) hours of the Town Boards’
decision. If the owner does not abate the nuisance within the described forty-eight (48) hours,
the Code Compliance Officer shall cause the same nuisance to be abated and cost in excess
of the forfeited fee assessed accordingly.
7. Town’s Option to Abate Nuisance. In any case where the owner, occupant or person in charge
of the property shall fail to cut his/her lawn, grass or weeds as set forth above, then, and in
that event, the Town may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as follows:
a. The written notice required in Section 9.06(5) shall inform said person that in the event
of his/her failure to abate the nuisance within the prescribed time, the Town shall abate
the same and the cost thereof shall be assessed to the property owner as a special charge.
b. The Town shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject’s property and
shall charge the expenses of so doing at a rate as established by resolution by the Town
Board. The charges shall be set forth in a statement to the Town Clerk who, in turn, shall
mail the same to the owner of the subject premises. If the said statement is not paid in
full within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Town Finance Director/Treasurer shall enter the
charges in the tax roll as a special tax against the lot or parcel of land, and the same shall
be collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate or as provided under Section
66.0809, Wis. Stats.

actions allowed by law, including other actions under this Code of Ordinances.

standard dictionary.
12. Conflicts of Ordinance. In any case where a provision of this ordinance is found to conflict
with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety or health ordinance or code of this Town,
the provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the
health and safety of the people shall prevail.
13. Variations and Exceptions.
a. Where in the judgment of the Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer, it would be
inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of this ordinance because exceptional or
undue hardship would result; the Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer may
waive or modify any requirements to the extent deemed just and proper. Application for
any such variance shall be made in writing by the property owner, stating fully all facts
relied upon the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with any additional data which may
aid the Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer in his/her analysis of the requested
variance.
23 | P a g e
b. The Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer shall not grant variations or exceptions
to the regulations of this ordinance unless he/she shall make findings based upon the
evidence presented to him/her in each specific case that:
i. The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public safety, health
or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood
in which the property is located;
ii. The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the
property for which the variation is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property;
iii. Because of the physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved, a hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship, if the
strict letter of the regulations were carried out.
iv. The Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer, if he/she approves of the
variance, shall do so in writing within ten (10) days of the filing of the variance
request.
v. The decision of the Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer to deny a
variance may be appealed by filing an appeal request with the Building Inspector
or Code Compliance Officer within fourteen (14) days of his/her decision. A public
hearing on the appeal shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days by the Town
Board. All parties may be represented by counsel. The Town Board shall consider
all relevant information and shall render a decision which shall be binding.
9.14 COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE.
1. Purpose. The Town Board finds that there are now, or may be in the future, commercial and
industrial real property and buildings in the Town of Beloit which are so dilapidated, unsightly,
dangerous, unsanitary or inadequately maintained as to constitute a menace to the occupying
of such property. It is the purpose of this ordinance to preserve and promote the public
health, safety and general well-being of the people of the Town by regulating in a manner
which corrects the above problems with minimal infringement of each affected person’s
property.
2. Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all commercial and/or industrial buildings,
structures and land in the Town of Beloit.
3. General Requirements Relating to the Safe and Sanitary Maintenance of Buildings and

all property under his/her control to comply with the following requirements:
a. Every premise shall be maintained in a clean, sanitary and safe condition and comply with
all applicable legal requirements of the Town of Beloit and Rock County.
b. Every foundation, roof, floor, exterior and interior wall, ceiling, inside and outside stair,

that normal use may cause to be placed thereon; and shall be maintained in sound
condition and good repair.
24 | P a g e
c. All exterior surfaces of buildings and fences made of materials not inherently resistant to
deterioration shall be periodically coated with paint or another suitable preservation
which provides adequate resistance to weathering.

condition as to provide proper drainage of storm water. This shall include being
substantially free from rust and/or corrosion.
e. All vacant lots shall be maintained by the owner in a clean, sanitary and safe condition.
No debris shall be allowed to accumulate on said vacant lot and it shall be maintained in
vermin-free and weed-free condition.
f. Graffiti, as defined in Section 9.13(3)(a)(xi) this ordinance, shall be removed by the
property owner, property manager, occupant, or by the Town at the property owner’s
expense. The Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer may order graffiti removed
within a certain time. If a property owner fails to remove graffiti within a time specified
in the order, the Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer may cause the graffiti to
be removed. The Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer shall keep an accurate
account of the expenses thereof and report the same to the Town Finance
Director/Treasurer, who shall annually prepare a statement of the expense so incurred
on each lot or parcel of land and report the same to the Town Clerk, and the amount
therein charged to each lot or parcel of land shall be by said Clerk entered in the tax roll
as a special charge against said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be collected in all
respects like other special charges upon real estate under Section 66.0627, Wis. Stats.
Prosecution for failure to remove graffiti under this ordinance shall not bar the Town from
charging owners for graffiti removal, nor shall charging owners for graffiti removal bar
prosecution.
4. Responsibilities of Owners and Occupants of Commercial/Industrial Properties. Every owner
or occupant, if the occupant has assumed responsibility under the terms of a written lease,
shall either personally or by agent, improve or maintain all commercial and industrial property

meet the requirements set forth in this ordinance or in applicable rules and regulations

in a newspaper of general circulation.
vi. At the end of the period of time allowed for the correction of any violation
alleged, the Building Inspector or Code Compliance Officer shall re-inspect the
building or structure described in the notice.

correction of the alleged violations.
9. Designation of Unfit Buildings and/or Structures; Corrections; Demolition.
a. Any commercial or industrial building or structure unit shall be designated as unfit for
occupancy when the following two (2) conditions exist at the same time:

6 | P a g e
2. Site Regulations.
a. Building Must Be on a Lot. Every building hereafter erected, structurally altered, or
relocated shall be located on a lot as defined herein, and in no case, except in Planned
Unit Developments, Condominium Developments, Multifamily Developments and
Industrial Districts, shall there be more than one principal building on a lot. In residential
and agricultural districts, any building used for human habitation shall constitute the
principal building. Multiple outbuildings with a farming use are permitted within
Agricultural Districts. Where multiple principal structures are permitted, development
can occur only if it would not be contrary to the purpose of the ordinance and provided
that sufficient lot area is provided and the buildings so located as to individually meet the
setback, lot size, and open space requirements of the district in which it is located. No
accessory building shall be constructed or occupied until the principal building is under
construction or completed.
b. Building on a Private Street or Way. Upon the recommendation of the Planning
Commission and subject to the approval of the Town Board, a building may be permitted
on a tract of land that does not abut on a public street or officially approved way, provided
such tract of land is at least three (3) acres in area, has access by permanent dedication
at least sixty six feet (66’) wide to a public street or way, does not conflict with plans for
the future development of streets in the area, or is within a Planned Unit Development
approved pursuant to Section 10.14 of this code. The duty to maintain access to such tract
of land shall be the responsibility of the owner of such land and not the Town of Beloit.
c. No Undesirable Objects or Structures. No building shall be erected, structurally altered,
or relocated, and no lumber, materials, furniture, or other equipment shall be stacked,
piled, or stored in a manner that adversely affects the property values and general
desirability of the neighborhood. A vehicle that has been abandoned, disassembled, is
disabled, junked, or wrecked shall not be stored anywhere on any premises except in an
authorized salvage yard or unless it is completely enclosed in a building.
d. Building Grade. Every building hereafter erected, structurally altered, or relocated, shall
be in satisfactory relationship with the established street grades, or with the existing
street grade where one is established, with consideration for proper drainage and safe
vehicular access.
e. Grading and Preservation of Topography. To protect property owners from possible
damage due to change in the existing grade of adjoining lands, and to aid in preserving
and protecting the natural beauty and character of the landscape, no change in the
existing topography of any land shall be made that would result in increasing any portion
of the slope to a ratio greater than three horizontals to one vertical or which would alter
the existing drainage or topography in any way as to adversely affect the adjoining
property. Any excavation or removal or relocation of material in excess of one hundred
(100) cubic yards must be approved by the Town Board.
3. Drainage Regulations.
a. Adequate Drainage Required. No principal building shall be erected, structurally altered,
or relocated on land that is not adequately drained at all times, nor which is subject to
7 | P a g e
periodic flooding, nor so that the lowest floor level, including any basement floor, is less
than one (1) foot above the highest anticipated seasonal ground water level.
b. Obstruction to Drainage Prohibited. The damming, filling, relocating, or otherwise
interfering with the natural flow of surface water along any surface water drainage
channel or natural water course shall not be permitted except with approval of the Town
Board, and, where applicable, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) pursuant to
Chapter 30, Wis. Stats.
c. Building Restricted Adjacent to Drainage Channels or Watercourses. No building other
than a bridge, dam, boathouse, or revetment subject to the aforesaid approval, shall be
erected, structurally altered, or relocated with seventy five feet (75’) of the average
annual high water line of such surface water drainage channel, lake, or natural water
course, nor so that the lowest floor of said building is less than three feet (3’) above the
ordinary high water line.

5. Decision Criteria. In reviewing an application for a site plan/plan of operation, the Planning Commission shall
consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter including standards for specific
requirements for certain land uses and activities. The following are the criteria to be used in the review of site
plan/plan of operation requests:
i. Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. The relationship of the proposed use to the objectives of the
Town of Beloit Comprehensive Plan.
ii. Project/Business Compatibility. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
within 300' of the proposed use and within five hundred feet (500') along the same street and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future within the neighborhood and conditions that
would make the use more compatible.
6. Site Plan.
a. Site Organization. The organization of buildings, driveways, parking areas, open spaces, pedestrian
facilities, landscaping, fences, lights, signs and other structures should achieve a functional, safe, and
harmonious site relationship. At the same time, the site organization should be compatible with existing
positive characteristics of the site.
b. Location of Buildings. The setback of buildings from streets, the spacing between buildings, and
arrangement of buildings shall be considered in relation to the prevailing development in the area.
c. Drives, Parking and Circulation. Special attention shall be given to limiting the number of vehicular access
points and their location, general on-site vehicular circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic flows, and the arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient. The screening and
landscaping of parking lots needs to be addressed to minimize the visual impacts. The number of available
parking stalls should comply with the minimum requirements for the intended use.
d. Grading and Drainage. The existing and proposed grades and drainage patterns are to be reviewed to
ensure that proper storm water drainage can occur.
e. Utility Service. The installation of underground electric, telephone and other utilities is encouraged
whenever feasible. Remaining aboveground utilities should be designed to have a harmonious
relationship to neighboring properties and the site.
f. Views. Important views within the site and the immediate area as well as more distant scenic vistas shall
be protected and enhanced with the new development.
g. Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in a natural state insofar as practicable by minimizing tree
and soil removal. Grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of or an improvement
upon the neighboring area. Plant species and composition should be compatible with the site.
59 | P a g e
h. Signs and Lighting. The size, location, design, color, texture, lighting, and materials of all signage shall be
complimentary to the site. All lighting shall be designed to avoid excessive illumination onto adjacent
residential properties.
7. Building Design. All buildings shall be designed to be compatible with or an improvement to existing adjacent
structures. Factors to be reviewed include building heights, exterior materials, and building forms including
roof shapes and pitches.
8. Other Factors. Other factors pertinent to the proposed use, site conditions, or surrounding area
considerations that the Zoning Administrator/Planner or Plan Commission feel are necessary for review to
make an informed decision.
9. Site Plan Revisions. Any revisions to the site plan/plan of operation after initial approval shall be reviewed and
approved as an amendment to an active site plan/plan of operation by the Planning Commission prior to the
issuance of a Zoning Permit and will follow the same review process.
10. Certificate of Occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be granted until all improvements shown on an
approved site plan have been completed in accordance therewith; provided that upon a finding by the Building
Inspector that certain improvements cannot be completed due to seasonal or other factors beyond the
control of the developer, and that temporary occupancy prior to completion will involve no health or safety
hazard, the Building Inspector may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy bearing an expiration date,
which date shall allow reasonable time for completion of all required improvements prior to the date of
expiration of the temporary certificate of occupancy.
11. Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. Acceptance of a temporary certificate of occupancy implies consent to
make completion of any required improvements not completed prior to the expiration date of the temporary
certificate of occupancy and forfeiture of any portion thereof not so applied, but no action or inaction by the
Town in respect to any required improvement shall serve to extend the time of validity of any temporary
certificate of occupancy or excuse any violation of this chapter.

10.12 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
1. Purpose. A conditional use is development that would not generally be appropriate within a district but might
be allowed in certain locations within the district if specific requirements are met. The compatibility must be
judged based on the circumstances and may require the imposing of conditions before development or
occupancy is permitted. The purpose is to allow a reasonable degree of discretion in determining the
suitability of a development at a specific location.
2. Applicability.
60 | P a g e
a. New Conditional Uses. No person shall operate a conditional use or construct facilities that are intended
for a conditional use, as listed in the zoning districts, without first obtaining a conditional use permit
approval from the Town Board.
b. Amended Conditional Uses. If any holder of a Conditional Use Permit wishes to extend or alter the terms
of this permit, he/she must apply for such extension or alteration through the procedure of application
for Conditional Use Permits detailed herein.
c. Existing Conditional Uses. All uses existing at the effective date of this ordinance, which would be classified
as conditional uses in the zoning district concerned if they were to be established after the effective date
of this ordinance, are hereby declare to be conforming conditional uses to the extent of the existing
operation only. Any addition, alteration, extension, or other proposed change in the existing operation
shall be subject to the conditional use procedures as if such use were being established anew.
3. Required Information. The items required to be submitted for Conditional Use Permit approval shall be those
items listed in Section 10.11 that are required for Site Plan/Plan of Operation approval, unless otherwise
required by this Code. However, if a successor takes over a conditional use permit previously granted where
the items listed in Section 10.11 were considered, the successor must only address items listed in Section
10.11 where a change will occur from the terms of the approved conditional use.
4. Review Procedure.
a. Procedure. Applications for a Conditional Use Permit shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator/Planner
on an official application form and shall be accompanied by the required fee and detailed written and
graphic materials fully explaining the proposed development. A public hearing shall be conducted by the
Planning Commission. After receiving public testimony, input from the applicant and Town Staff, the
Planning Commission shall close the public hearing. The Planning Commission shall review the proposal
as it relates to the decision criteria in Section 10.12 and other applicable requirements in the Zoning Code.
The Planning Commission shall then forward a recommendation to the Town Board on the proposed
conditional use. The Town Board shall review the request, the Planning Commission’s recommendation,
and the decision criteria. The Town Board shall then decide on the matter before it. Conditional Use
Permits may be approved by an affirmative vote of a simple majority of the Town Board.
b. Public Hearing Notice. The Planning Commission shall fix a reasonable time for a public hearing by
publication in the official newspaper as a Class II Notice under Chapter 985 Wis. Stats. In addition to the
Class II Notice, all conditional use applications shall be noticed to all property owners within three hundred
feet (300’) of the property line via regular mail.
i. CUP on Q-1 Parcels. Any public notice concerning a conditional use for a parcel zoned as Q-1
Resource Extraction District shall be sent to all property owners within one thousand feet (1,000’)
via regular mail.
c. Conditions. The Plan Commission and the Town Board shall consider possible adverse effects of the
proposed conditional use and what additional requirements may be necessary to reduce such adverse
effects. In permitting a new or amended conditional use, the Town Board may impose additional
conditions that it considers necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding area and the Town.
Conditions imposed may include, but are not limited to, time limitations within which to act, landscaping,
architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, lighting,
fencing, location, size and number of signs, water supply and waste disposal systems, higher performance
standards, street improvements, certified survey maps, flood proofing, ground cover, diversions, silting
basins, terraces, stream bank protection, planting screens, operational control, hours of operation,
improve traffic circulation, highway access restrictions, increased setbacks, or additional parking. Any
conditions approved by the Town Board shall be made an integral part of the permit. Such conditions shall
61 | P a g e
be set forth in detail in writing by the Town Clerk and a copy of such conditions shall be sent, certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the applicant.
d. Issuance and Safeguards. The permit for a conditional use shall amend the Zoning Permit and shall be
attached thereto. In recommending any conditional use, the Town Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance. The Board may require that the Town be
provided with either a surety bond, cash escrow, certificate of deposit, securities, irreversible letter of
credit, or cash deposit prior to issuance of the conditional use permit. The security shall be used to
guarantee compliance with the conditions of the permit and shall be returned to the developer when an
occupancy permit is issued.
5. Decision Criteria. In making a determination on an application for a conditional use, the Plan Commission and
the Town Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance including
standards for specific requirements for certain land uses and activities. The following are the criteria to be
used in the review of conditional uses:
a. Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. The relationship of the proposed use to the goals, policies, and
objectives in the Town of Beloit Comprehensive Plan.
b. Compatibility. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development within the surrounding
area and development anticipated in the foreseeable future within the neighborhood and conditions that
would make the use more compatible.
c. Importance of Services to the Town. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community, if any, and the requirements of the facility for certain locations, if any, and without undue
inconvenience to the developer, and the availability of alternative locations equally suitable.

considerations that the Board feels are necessary for review to make an informed decision.
6. Compliance.
a. Compliance Required. The conditions set forth in an approved Conditional Use Permit shall be complied
with by the applicant and property owners and future tenants or users of the property. Any deviation or
alteration of use from those conditions shall constitute a violation of the terms of the Conditional Use
Permit. Such violation shall constitute a violation of this Code and will be subject to prosecution and
penalties under the terms of this Zoning Code.
b. Revocation of a Conditional Use Permit. If a conditional use has not operated in conformity with the
conditions of the permit or other requirements in the Zoning Code, the Town Board may, after due notice
and public hearing, revoke the conditional use permit by a majority vote.
c. Discontinued Conditional Use Permit. If a conditional use has been discontinued for a period of twelve
(12) consecutive months, the conditional use permit will automatically expire without notice or public
hearing. A business of a seasonal nature shall not be deemed discontinued during periods in which it is
normally inactive (i.e., summer camps, snowmobile course, ski areas, marinas, quarries, etc.)
d. Unused Conditional Use Permit. A conditional use permit shall automatically expire, without notice or
hearing, if actual construction of the approved use for which a permit was issued has not been
substantially commenced within one (1) year or the time limitations, if any, set forth in the Conditional

e. Reverted Use. Upon expiration of a conditional use status, the owner of the premises shall be required to
bring all such land and buildings into conformity with the district regulations of the district in which such
former conditional use is located, and all other provisions of this Code, within ninety (90) days from such
determination.
7. Payment of Fees. The applicant shall pay all professional fees incurred by the Town for review of the request
by the Zoning Administrator/Planner, Town Administrator, Town Clerk, Building Inspector, Town Attorney, or
consultants serving the Town in accordance with the Town’s Fee Schedule. The Town Board may require cash
escrow, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other form of surety to ensure payment of fees. In situations where
the grant of a conditional use permit may require prolonged administrative costs incurred by the Town, an
annual payment to the Town from the permit holder may be set as a condition of approval by the Town Board.
8. Conditional Use Standards. The following standards shall be required for the applicable conditional use in
addition to conditions required by the Town Board:
a. Community Based Residential Facilities (CBRF’s). No adult family home, CBRF, or other community living
arrangement facility may be established within two thousand five hundred feet (2,500’) of another adult
family home, CBRF, or other community living arrangement facility, nor can the total capacity of all such
facilities in a ward exceed a total number of persons equivalent to one percent (1%) of the population of
the ward. In any case, the total capacity of all such adult family homes, CBRF’s or other community living
arrangement facilities in the Town may not exceed one percent (1%) of the total Town population.
Exceptions to these limitations may be granted at the discretion of the Town by a Conditional Use Permit
issued pursuant to Section 10.12 of the Zoning Code. In reviewing applications for Conditional Use Permits

v. Cross sections of the site illustrating the final grading.
4. Review Procedure.
a. Conditional Use Permit Process. The review process for Conditional Use Permits established in Section
10.12 shall be required for Quarrying Permits.
b. Renewals. The procedure as designated above shall apply to applications for renewal of a permit.
Determination regarding renewal shall be based particularly on an evaluation of the effect of the
continuance of the use with relation to changing conditions in the area. Where renewal is not granted,
the reasons for refusal shall be presented to the applicant in writing and made a part of the records of the
Town Board.
5. Decision Criteria. In reviewing mining permit applications, the Planning Commission and the Town Board shall
be guided by consideration of the public health, safety and welfare. They shall give particular consideration
to the decision criteria established for Condition Use Permits in Section 10.12, and the following factors in
making their decision:
a. The effect of the proposed operation on existing roads and traffic movement in terms of adequacy,
safety, and efficiency.
b. The effect of the proposed operation on drainage and water supply.
c. The possibility of soil erosion as a result of the proposed operation.
d. The degree and effect of dust and noise as a result of the proposed operation.
e. The practical possibility of restoration of the site.
f. The effect of the proposed operation on the natural beauty, character, tax base, land value, and land
uses in the area.
g. The most suitable land use for the area.
6. Design Requirements.
a. General Requirements.
i. No part of the quarrying operation shall be permitted closer than one thousand feet (1,000’) nor
shall any accessory access road, parking area, or office building be permitted closer than five
hundred feet (500’) to any Residentially Zoned District.
65 | P a g e
ii. No quarrying operation shall be permitted if thirty (30) or more families reside within a band onehalf
mile (1/2) wide around the perimeter of the proposed operation.
b. Setback Requirements.
i. Setbacks Adjacent to Public Streets. No part of the quarrying operation other than access roads
shall be located closer than two hundred feet (200’), nor shall any accessory parking area, stock
pile, or office building be located closer than one hundred feet (100’) to the setback line along any
street or highway.
ii. Side Yard Requirements. No part of the quarrying operation shall be permitted closer than two
hundred feet (200’), nor shall any accessory access road, parking area, or office building be
permitted closer than fifty feet (50’) to any property line except with the written consent of the
owner of the adjoining property.
c. Operation Requirements.
i. Fencing or other suitable barrier shall be erected and maintained around the site or around
portions of the site where in the determination of the Town Board such fencing or barrier is
necessary for the protection of the public, and shall be of a type approved by the Town Board.
ii. All machinery and equipment used in the quarrying operation shall be constructed, maintained
and operated in such a manner as to minimize dust, noise and vibration. Access and haulage roads
on the site shall be maintained in a dust-free condition by surfacing or treatment as directed by
the Town Engineer.
iii. The crushing, washing, refining, or processing other than the initial removal of material, may be
permitted as an accessory use only as specifically authorized under the terms of the grant of
permit.
iv. In stone quarries the production or manufacturing of veneer stone, sills, lintels, cut flagstone,
hearthstones, paving stone and similar architectural or structural stone and the storing or
stockpiling of such products on the site shall be considered a permissible part of the operation,
provided such production does not require the use of crushing or other heavy machinery except
as may be otherwise specifically authorized under the terms of the grant of permit.
v. The manufacture of concrete building blocks or other similar blocks, the production or
manufacture of lime products, the production of ready-mixed concrete and any similar production
or manufacturing processes that might be related to the quarrying operation shall not be
permitted.
vi. The washing of sand and gravel shall be prohibited in any operation where the source of water is
of doubtful capacity or where the quantity of water required will, in the opinion of the Town
Engineer, seriously affect the supply for other uses in the area.
vii. The planting of trees and shrubs and other appropriate landscaping shall be provided where
deemed necessary by the Town Board to screen the operation so far as practical from normal
view, to enhance the general appearance from the public right-of-way, and generally to minimize
the damaging effect of the operation on the beauty and character of the surrounding countryside.
Such planting shall be started as soon as practicable, but no later than one (1) year after quarrying
operations have begun.
viii. The Town Board shall establish the permitted hours of operation for quarrying and related
activities in the Quarrying Permit. In determining the permitted hours of operation consideration
shall be given to the impact of the permitted activities on the community and the criteria found
in Sections 10.12 and 10.13 of this Zoning Code. Until revised, Quarry Permits are issued to
quarries existing at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code, existing quarries shall only
conduct their operations between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and shall not conduct
operations on Sundays or legal holidays.
d. Restorative Requirements.
66 | P a g e
i. In order to ensure that the area of quarrying operation shall be restored to a condition of practical
usefulness and reasonable physical attractiveness, the owner or operator shall, prior to the
issuance of a permit, submit to the Town Board a plan for such restoration in the form of the
following:
A. An agreement with the Town whereby the applicant contracts to restore the premises to a
condition and within a time satisfactory to the Town.
B. A physical restoration plan showing the proposed contours after restoration, plantings and
other special features of restoration, and the method by which such restoration is to be
accomplished.
C. A bond, written by a licensed surety company, a certified check, or other financial guarantee
satisfactory to the Town, in an amount sufficient in the opinion of the Town Engineer to secure
the performance of the agreement.
D. Such agreement and financial guarantee shall be in a form approved by the Town Attorney.
E. In the event of the applicant’s failure to fulfill this agreement, such bond, check, or other
financial guarantee shall be deemed forfeit for the purpose of enabling the Town to perform
the restoration.
F. Restoration shall proceed as soon as practicable and at the order and direction of the Town
Engineer. However, the owner or operator may, at his option, submit a plan for progressive
restoration as the quarrying operation is being carried on. The required bond in such case
may cover progressive stages of the restoration for periods of not less than two years.
G. At any stage during the restoration, the plan may be modified by mutual agreement between
the Town and the owner or operator.
H. Where there is any backfilling, the material used or the method of filling shall not be such as
to create a health hazard nor which would be objectionable because of odor, combustibility,
or unsightliness. In any case, the finished grade of the restored area except for rock faces,
outcroppings, water bodies, or areas of proposed building or paving construction, shall be a
sufficient depth of earth to support plant growth.
I. Within one year after the cessation of the operation, all temporary structures (except fences),
equipment, stockpiles, rubble heaps, or other debris shall be removed or backfilled into the
excavation so as to leave the premises in a neat and orderly condition.
J. In any restoration procedure that takes place in sand or gravel pits or on other sites where
the material is of a loose or friable nature, no slope shall be left that is steeper than a ratio of
one and one-half horizontal to one vertical. In no case shall any slope exceed the normal angle
of slippage of the material involved.
7. Compliance. Compliance requirements for conditional use permits established in Section 10.12 shall also apply
to all quarrying permits.
8. Exceptions.
a. The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to the removal of sod.
b. When the operation is limited to the removal of topsoil, the Town Board may, consistent with the intent
of these regulations, modify any or all the provisions of this section provided, however, that in no case
shall such operation be permitted closer than ten feet (10’) from any property line, or to a depth in excess
of eighteen inches (18”) or so as to adversely affect the drainage of the area.
c. The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to an operation that is incident to legitimate use of the
premises, provided, however, where such operation involves the commercial disposal of the material
67 | P a g e
removed, the approval of the Town Board shall be required and such operation shall be limited to a
maximum period of six (6) months.
d. The Town Board may, consistent with the intent of these regulations, modify the provisions relative to
permitted hours of operation; and where the character of terrain, surrounding development, or other
special conditions would justify, such modification may permit a reduction in the required setback or side
yard; provided, however, that in no case shall the setback be less than one hundred feet (100’), or the
side yard be less than one hundred feet (100’) for quarrying operations of twenty feet (20’) for any
accessory access road, parking area, or office building except as may be otherwise provided.
e. Application to Existing Operations.
i. Permit. Within sixty (60) days after the adoption of this ordinance all existing quarrying operations
shall be required to register with the Town Clerk, submitting pertinent data relative to the present
operation, including the boundaries of the actual operation and of the ownership. A Quarrying
Permit shall be granted to such existing operation subject to compliance with the Operation
Requirements of this Zoning Code where they can reasonably be applied under existing
circumstances.
ii. Plan for Restoration. There shall be required within one (1) year after adoption of this ordinance,
the submission of a plan for restoration of the site of any existing quarrying operation. The plan
for restoration in such case shall not, however, impose requirements that are unreasonable from
an engineering or economic perspective with respect to conditions resulting from operations prior
to enactment of this ordinance.
9. Payment of Fees. The applicant shall pay all professional fees incurred by the Town for review of a quarry
permit by the Zoning Administrator/Planner, Town Administrator, Town Engineer, Town Clerk,
Building/Compliance Inspector, Town Attorney, or consultants serving the Town in accordance with the
Town’s Fee Schedule. The Town Board may require cash escrow or an irrevocable letter of credit to ensure
payment of fees.
10.14 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
1. Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to encourage more efficient use of
lands that are planned uses and provision of more amenities by allowing, under certain circumstances, a more
flexible means of land development and redevelopment than is otherwise permissible under the lot-by-lot
restrictions of the other standard zoning districts.
a. Planned Unit Development provisions are intended for application to larger and/or unique sites where a
flexible approach to zoning regulations would facilitate more efficient use of the site and protection of
natural resources achieved through clustering development and other innovative site planning and design
techniques.
b. Typically, PUD’s enable development of portions of a site at either higher densities or with less restrictive
lot provisions in exchange for preserving other portions of the site in open space or providing above
normal site amenities.
c. Condominium projects with jointly owned common spaces and/or commonly owned structural walls,
roofs, or other structural elements must be approved as PUD’s if, as a result of a condominium division of
the land, the lot requirements of the district in which the development is located cannot otherwise be
met. This requirement would apply to townhouses where the resulting lot size would be less than
otherwise required.
68 | P a g e
2. Application Procedure. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) application and development procedure is a
two-phase process.
a. General Development Plan (PUD-GDP). The initial phase is the submittal and approval of a General
Development Plan. The PUD-GDP establishes the land uses, the permissible densities, the general land
plan, the layout of public and private roads, the general landscape treatment, general grading and
drainage plan, and a description of the planned phasing. The PUD-GDP should include an outline of the
intended structure of the property owner’s association, deed restrictions, and restrictive covenants, if
applicable.
i. Once a PUD-GDP is approved, the approval resolution and the attached plans submitted by the
application become the interim zoning regulations for the PUD site. Subsequent submittal of the
Specific Implementation Plan (PUD-SIP) and development must follow the PUD-GDP provisions.
b. Specific Implementation Plan (PUD-SIP). The second phase of PUD approval is the submittal and approval
of the PUD-SIP. The intent of the Specific Implementation Plan is to provide the Planning Commission and
the Town Board with a precise plan for the development of each sequential phase of the PUD.
i. PUD-SIP’s must be in substantial compliance with the interim zoning requirements and guidelines
established in the PUD-GDP.
ii. A developer may either submit the PUD-SIP for the initial phase of development at the same time
as the PUD-SIP or submit the PUD-SIP at a later date. A final development permit or Zoning Permit
may not be issued until the PUD-SIP for that phase of the development has been approved.
3. Applicability.
a. Ownership. A tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD shall be under the control of a single owner,
partnership, or corporation, where each owner agrees in advance to be bound by the conditions and
regulations that will be effective within the district and to record such covenants, easements, and other
provisions with the County.
b. Size. PUD’s must be at least 5 acres in size.
4. Development Plans.
a. PUD-GDP Applicant Submittal Requirements. The submittal requirements and review procedure for the
PUD-GDP shall be as required for other zoning districts, except that in addition to the information required
for other development permits, the following information must be filed with the Zoning
Administrator/Planner:
i. A map of the project area including its relationship to the surrounding properties, topography, or
other prominent site features.
ii. A statement as to why PUD zoning is proposed. The statement shall identify reasons why PUD
zoning is preferable to development under standard zoning districts.
iii. A scaled plan of the site at a scale of not less than one inch (1") equals one hundred feet (100')
showing:
A. Land uses and development densities.
B. The size, arrangement, and location of lots.
C. Proposed general location of buildings or groups of buildings.
D. Public and private roads.
E. The location of recreational areas and open space.
F. General landscaping plan.
G. General grading plan, including drainage plan indicating on-site stormwater
detention/retention areas and indicating the amount and location of off-site drainage.
69 | P a g e
H. Statistical data on the size of the development, density/intensity of various subareas, and
expected phasing or staging.
I. A description of the intended organizational structure for a property owner’s association, if
any.
J. A description of deed restrictions or restrictive covenants, if any.
iv. The Planning Commission or Town Board may require other special studies or plans that would
aid in consideration of the proposed development.
b. PUD-GDP Zoning Administrator/Planner Review. Upon receipt of the application and plan, the Zoning
Administrator/Planner shall refer it to other departments and agencies for review as to compliance with
pertinent Town standards and regulations. Within thirty (30) days the Zoning Administrator/Planner shall
recommend to the Plan Commission approval of the proposal in the form submitted, approval with
modifications, or disapproval of the proposal. The recommendation of the Zoning Administrator/Planner
shall include findings of fact and shall set forth the reasons for the recommendation specifying with
particularity in what respects the plan would or would not be in the public interest, including but not
limited to:
i. Conformity with the Town of Beloit Comprehensive Plan.
ii. The extent to which the plan departs from zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise
applicable to the subject property, including but not limited to density, bulk, and use, and the
reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest.
iii. The manner in which the plan does or does not make adequate provision for public services,
drainage, traffic, and recreational amenities.
iv. The nature and extent of open space, the reliability and sufficiency of the proposal for
maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of
the amount and function of the open space in terms of the densities proposed in the plan.
v. The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the planned development project upon the
neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established.
vi. In the case of a plan that proposes development over a period of years, the sufficiency of the
terms and conditions proposed to protect and maintain the integrity of the plan.
vii. In built-up areas, the suitability of the proposed structures in relation to existing structures to
remain and anticipated future development of the area.
c. PUD-GDP Planning Commission Review. With thirty (30) days after the filing of the application and after
receiving the Zoning Administrator/Planner’s report, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
PUD-GDP application. Within thirty (30) days after such hearing, the Commission shall submit its
recommendations to the Town Board. The Commission may recommend tentative approval in whole or
in part, with or without modification, or recommend disapproval.
d. Town Board Review. The Town Board shall either grant approval of the PUD-GDP application, with or
without modification, or deny such application. If approved by the Board, the area of land involved shall
be re-designated as a PUD-GDP by the Zoning Code and such ordinance shall incorporate the plan,
including any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed by the Board. The PUD-GDP is an interim
zoning classification that does not enable actual development until the PUD-SIP is approved.
5. Specific Implementation Plans.
a. PUD-SIP Applicant Submittal Requirements. Within twelve (12) months of approval of the PUD-GDP, the
applicant shall submit the first phase or the entire PUD-SIP with exact sizes and locations of structures
and other improvements, including detailed grading plan, drainage plan, and landscape plan. If a land
division is necessary, a CSM, a final plat or a final plat of that segment to be developed, in compliance with
the town’s Land Division Regulations, shall be submitted prior to issuance of the PUD-SIP.
70 | P a g e
b. PUD-SIP Zoning Administrator/Planner Review. If the Zoning Administrator/Planner finds the final plan
and plat to be in substantial agreement with the approved PUD-GDP, the Zoning Administrator/Planner
shall submit the documents directly to the Planning Commission for final action. If the SIP is not in
substantial conformance with the PUD-GDP, the Zoning Administrator/Planner shall identify such
discrepancies in a letter of transmittal to the Planning Commission.
c. PUD-SIP Planning Commission and Town Board Review and Approval. The Planning Commission shall
consider the SIP at a regularly held meeting. A public hearing is not required at the SIP stage. If approved
by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the Town
Board. Subject to Town Board approval, the area of land involved shall be re-designated as a PUD-SIP by
Zoning Code and such ordinance shall incorporate the plan, including any conditions or restrictions that
may be imposed by the Town Board.
6. Effect of PUD-SIP Approval. The final plan as approved, together with the conditions and restrictions imposed
by the Town Board, shall constitute the final zoning for the district, provided that general zoning regulations
that were applicable to the land involved prior to approval of the plan and are not inconsistent with the PUDSIP
plan shall continue to be applicable.
7. Zoning Permit Restricted. Development and Zoning Permits for PUD’s may not be issued until the PUD-SIP is
approved by the Town Board. No Zoning Permit shall be issued for any structure within the PUD-SIP district
unless and until the Zoning Administrator/Planner certifies that it conforms to the provisions of the PUD-SIP
plan and other applicable zoning requirements.
8. Changes or Alterations. Any change of the PUD plans subsequent to approval of the PUD-SIP shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator/Planner. If the Zoning Administrator/Planner determines that the
change constitutes a substantial modification, the developer will be required to amend the PUD-SIP, and if
necessary, the PUD-GDP, following the procedures set forth in this ordinance for review and approvals. If, in
the opinion of the Zoning Administrator/Planner, such changes do not constitute a substantial alteration of
either the GDP or SIP, the change may be accomplished by approval of the Zoning Administrator/Planner.
Such approved changes or modifications shall be documented and recorded in the official file of the Town on
the PUD.
9. Expiration. If substantial development progress has not occurred within one (1) year of a PUD-SIP approval,
the Town Board, following a Planning Commission recommendation, may revoke the PUD-GDP and PUD-SIP
approval and revert the site zoning to its previous zoning district classification.
10.15 ZONING AMENDMENTS.
1. Purpose. Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare, or good zoning practice requires, the
Town Board may by ordinance, after recommendation thereon by the Planning Commission, amend the
regulations or change the Zoning Map. The Planning Commission shall submit to the Town Board its
recommendations regarding all applications for amendments or changes within thirty (30) days after referral
to the Planning Commission.
2. Required Information. Application for any change of district boundaries or uses shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator/Planner, with a copy to the Town Clerk, upon such forms and accompanied by such data
and information as is needed to assure the fullest practicable presentation of facts, as required by the Planning
Commission.
71 | P a g e
3. Review Procedure.
a. Initiation of Amendment. An amendment or change may be initiated by motion of the Town Board, by
motion of the Planning Commission, or, in the case of district boundary changes, by filing an application
by owners of fifty percent (50%) or more of the area of the properties proposed to be changed.
b. Notification of Public Hearing on Amendment.
i. Before submitting its recommendations on any amendment to the regulations or change in the
Zoning Map to the Town Board, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing
thereon pursuant to a Class II Notice. A Class II Notice shall, prior to hearing, be published in the
newspaper and shall specify the time, place, subject and purpose of the hearing.
ii. When an amendment involves changes in district boundaries or classification, the Zoning
Administrator/Planner shall send by regular mail at least ten (10) days before the date of such
hearing, written notice of such hearing to the owners of record as listed in the best available
records, of all lands proposed to be changed and all lands situated wholly or partly within 300’ of
the outer perimeter of the subject property. The Notice shall contain, if possible, the address or
fire numbers of the property affected by such Notice.
iii. Special consideration regarding rezoning to Q-1. Any public notice concerning a conditional use
for a parcel zoned as Q-1 Resource Extraction District shall be sent to all property owners within
one thousand (1,000’) feet via regular mail.
c. Planning Commission Recommendation. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed amendment
to the regulations or change in district boundaries and render a decision thereon analyzing the advantages
and disadvantages of the proposal, based on the facts and circumstances, the Comprehensive Plan, and
other information. The Planning Commission shall transmit a written recommendation to the Town Board.
d. Town Board Final Action. After reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Commission thereon, the
Town Board shall consider such recommendations and, if it decides to proceed, shall instruct the Town
Attorney to prepare an ordinance for subsequent adoption by the Town Board of the proposed
amendment. If the Town Board so desires, it may order a second public hearing before the Town Board
pursuant to a Class II Notice.
e. Waiting Period between Petitions. A denial of rezoning shall be a final determination for a period of one
(1) year that the development will not be permitted unless the Town Board’s order includes leave to
amend. After the expiration of the one (1)-year period, a developer may make a new application for the
same amendment.
10.16 VARIANCE.
1. Authority. The Board of Adjustment shall have jurisdiction over approval of variances to the Zoning Code.
2. Required Information. Application for a variance or appeal shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator/Planner upon such forms and accompanied by such data and information as is needed to assure
the fullest practicable presentation of facts.
3. Review Procedure.
a. Notification of Public Hearing on Amendment. Before considering a variance application, the Board of
Adjustment shall hold at least one public hearing pursuant to providing notice to all property owners
within three hundred feet (300’) of the subject property by regular mail and shall publicly notice such
meeting.
72 | P a g e
b. Board of Adjustment Final Action. After receiving public testimony and closing the public hearing for a
variance application, the Board of Adjustment shall consider and decide on the variance application as it
relates to the decision criteria listed in Section 10.16(4). The Board may specify an expiration date by
which the action authorized by the variance must be commenced or completed.
c. Subject to Conditions. In granting any variance under the provisions of this ordinance, the Board of
Adjustment shall designate such conditions that will secure the objectives of the regulations or provisions
in the application of which the variance is granted as to light, access to direct sunlight for solar energy
systems, air, character of the neighborhood, conformity to the Comprehensive Plan, and, generally, the
public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare. A variance, once granted, stays attached
to that particular lot or use until the variant is obsolete.
d. Variances Void after six (6) Months. If an applicant fails to act on a variance granted within six (6) months
of the date the variance was approved, the variance shall be null and void.
4. Decision Criteria.
a. Findings Required. No variance from the terms of this Code shall be authorized unless all the following
facts and conditions exist:
i. Exceptional Circumstances. That there are exceptional conditions applying to the property in
question or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties or
classes of uses in the same zoning district.
ii. Physical Cause. That the surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property
involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out.
iii. Non-Economic Cause. That the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively on a desire for
economic or other material gain by the applicant or owner.
iv. Preservation of Property Rights. That such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same zoning district
and in the same vicinity including, but not limited to, the use of solar energy systems.
v. Absence of Detriment. That the authorizing of such variance will not be detrimental to adjacent
property, and will not materially impair the purposes of this Zoning Code or the public interest.
vi. General Nature. No variance shall be authorized unless the Board of Adjustment specifically finds
that the condition, situation, or intended use of the subject property is not general or recurrent
in a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to cover
such cases.
vii. Minimum Variance Required. The Board shall find that the variance is the minimum variance that
will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. The Board of Adjustment
shall be satisfied by the evidence heard before it that the granting of such variance will alleviate
a hardship approaching confiscation as distinguished from a special privilege sought by the owner.
10.17 Non-Conforming Lots, Uses and Structures.
1. Purpose. Where the districts established contain structures and uses of land that were lawful prior to the
adoption of this ordinance, but that would now be prohibited, it is intended to permit these non-conformities
to continue, but not to allow alteration or enlargement of use or structure in such a manner as to increase the
non-conformity.
2. Non-Conforming Use. The use of land, dwelling, or building that existed lawfully before the current Zoning
Code was enacted or amended but does not conform with the use restrictions in the current ordinance.
73 | P a g e
3. Non-Conforming Uses of Land. No non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of this ordinance. No non-conforming
use of land shall continue if it ceases for any reason (except where governmental action impedes access to
the premises) for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months. No non-conforming use of land shall
be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of this ordinance.
4. Non-Conforming Uses of Buildings, Premises, Structure or Fixture.
a. Non-Conforming Uses. The continued lawful use of a building, premises, structure or fixture existing
at the time of the adoption or amendment of this ordinance may not be prohibited although the use
does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance. However, the non-conforming use may not be
extended.
b. Discontinuance of Non-Conforming Use. No non-conforming use of the building, premises, structure
or fixture shall continue if it is discontinued for twelve (12) months.
5. Restoration of Certain Non-Conforming Building, Premises, Structure or Fixture.
a. A non-conforming building, premises, structure or fixture may be restored to the size, subject to
paragraph (ii), location and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred,
regardless of the cost, if both of the following apply:
i. The non-conforming building, premises, structure or fixture was damaged or destroyed on or
after March 2, 2006; and
ii. The damage or destruction was caused by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold
or infestation.
iii. The restoration of the building, premises, structure or fixture in Paragraph (i) may be larger
than the size it was immediately before the damage or destruction if necessary for the
building, premises, structure or fixture to comply with applicable state and federal
requirements.
b. Restoration of Other Non-Conforming Buildings, Premises, Structures or Fixtures. A non-conforming
building, premises, structure or fixture other than those subject to subsection (C), that is damaged or
destroyed to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost exclusive of
foundations, shall not be restored except in conformity with this ordinance.
6. Relocation. If a non-conforming building, premises, structure or fixture is moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it
is moved.
7. Building Safety. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition any building, premise, structure or fixture or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
8. Non-Conforming Lots.
a. Preexisting Uses on Non-Conforming Lots. Any existing conforming use or conforming structure on a nonconforming
lot existing on the effective date of this ordinance may be enlarged, extended, constructed,
or moved so long as such change does not increase the degree of non-conformity and other requirements
of this ordinance are met, a multifamily residential use may not be constructed, extended, or enlarged on
a non-conforming lot.
b. Division of Combined Non-Conforming Lots. Any two (2) or more lots under the same ownership and with
continuous frontage shall not be used or sold in a manner that diminishes possible compliance with this
Code.
c. Combined Lots. Any two (2) or more lots under common ownership, the individual lots when combined
shall not be deemed lawful for construction unless they are combined by a Certified Survey Map or
Subdivision Plat and recorded as one parcel with the Rock County Register of Deeds.
74 | P a g e
d. Development on Residential Non-Conforming Lots. A Zoning Permit may be issued for the construction of
a single-family residence on a non-conforming lot of record if the parcel is under separate ownership from
all adjacent parcels and was created prior to the adoption of this ordinance. Single-family residences shall
not be constructed on non-conforming lots of record less than thirty feet (30’) in width. Side yard setbacks
may be reduced to three inches (3”) per foot of lot width on these non-conforming lots.
9. Certificate of Occupancy for Non-Conforming Uses, Structures and Lots. Certificates of occupancy for nonconforming
uses, structures, and lots existing on the effective date of this ordinance may be issued by the
Building Inspector, providing that such certificates state that the use is a non-conforming use and does not
conform to the provisions of this ordinance.
10.18 ADMINISTRATION.
1. Zoning Administrator/Planner.
a. Duties of the Zoning Administrator/Planner. The Zoning Administrator/Planner shall properly administer
and enforce the Zoning Code. In addition to this authority, the Zoning Administrator/Planner shall:

considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes
flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself/herself or

circumstances makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for
an offense under this ordinance, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which
would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him/her to identify himself/herself and explain
his/her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
ordinance if the law enforcement officer did not comply with the preceding sentence or if it
appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if believed by the law
enforcement officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.

who has attained the legal drinking age.
5. Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following terms shall have the following meanings,
unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is intended:
a. Loiter. To sit, stand, loaf, lounge, wander or stroll in an aimless manner or to stop, pause
or remain in an area for no obvious reason.

which is offensive to the public morals or decency of the citizens of the Town of Beloit.

in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the circumstances
12 | P a g e
which may be considered in determining whether such purpose is manifested: that such
person is a known prostitute or panderer, that such person repeatedly beckons to stop or
attempts to stop, or engages male or female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly
stops or attempts to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waving of arms or any other
bodily gesture. The violator’s conduct must be such as to demonstrate a specific intent to
induce, entice, solicit or produce another to commit an act of prostitution. No arrest shall
be made for a violation of this ordinance unless the sworn law enforcement officer first

manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole.
m. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at
which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally,
but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour
composites of all outfalls, whereas Ph’s are determined from periodic grab samples.)
