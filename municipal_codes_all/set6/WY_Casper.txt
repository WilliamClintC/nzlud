Beginning with Supplement No. 35,

PREFACE 
    The Casper, Wyoming Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1989, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 35, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Robert L. Mullen, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 35, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance No. 6-19, adopted March 19, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 35, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables". This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein". 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)". If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)". Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)". 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 35, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 35, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 35, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

(Ord. 66-87 § 1, 1987) 
2.40.020 - Purpose of provisions. 
A.  The state of Wyoming and the city of Casper have a wide range of cultural resources that include prehistoric and historic sites, which are invaluable relics that remain to illustrate our state's past. The city council finds that the state and the city are noteworthy for their historic sites and natural beauty, including locations important to the settlement of the state and the West, and sites which are important in the founding and development of the city. In recent years many significant structures and historic and archeological sites have been destroyed without adequate consideration of either the values represented therein or the possibility of preserving the properties for use in economically productive ways. The citizens of the city share the belief that the state's natural resources enhance the quality of life for all and promote a general welfare. It is declared to be a matter of public policy to protect, enhance and perpetuate relics within the city which are of significant historical, archeological and architectural value, the same being found to be in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people. 
B.  The purpose of this chapter is to: 
1.  Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of improvements and historic districts which represent or reflect elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political, engineering and architectural history; 
2.  Safeguard the city's historic, architectural and cultural heritage as embodied and reflected in such historic structures, sites and districts as may be identified; 
3.  Stabilize and improve property values; 
4.  Foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past; 
5.  Protect and enhance the city's attractions to residents, tourists and visitors, and serve as a support and stimulus to industry and business to strengthen the economy in the city; and 
6.  Promote the use of historic structures, sites and districts for the education, pleasure and welfare of the residents of the city.

    Violations of this code and/or Wyoming Statutes may also be factors in the consideration of suspensions, revocations, nonrenewals or conditional renewals of licenses and permits. 
    In recognition of the fact that license holders who repeatedly violate the provisions of this code create an undue burden of the city in administering liquor licenses, in addition to any other penalties or remedies, licensees shall be subject to administrative fees of one thousand dollars for the third violation of this chapter within any consecutive twenty-four month period, and five thousand dollars for a fifth or subsequent violation within a consecutive twenty-four month period. Any violation relating to the license holder or licensed premises shall apply to this subsection, regardless of whether separate individual employees or agents of the licensee committed the individual violations. The violations need not be of the same section or subsection of this chapter to be counted in this total. 
    A notice to pay said fee shall be issued by the city clerk to the licensee upon notification by the court of licensee's convictions for the relevant offenses. The time frame for accumulation of the violations shall be the date of violations, not the dates of conviction. If such fee is not paid, or an appeal hearing before council requested in writing to the city clerk and accompanied by a bond in the amount of the fee at issue within ten days of the notice being given by the clerk, the license shall be suspended until such time as the fee is paid to the city clerk. If an appeal hearing is requested, it shall be in council's sole discretion, after hearing all the relevant facts in the matter, whether to suspend part or all of the fee. The hearing shall not be a contested case hearing, and the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to such hearing. 
(Ord. No. 2-19, 3-5-2019) 
5.08.540 - Council hearing and appeal of suspension or revocation. 
    If it appears to the city council that there are concerns that a suspension or revocation of a license may be appropriate, the licensee shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing before the city council. The purpose of such hearing is to allow the licensee to provide information demonstrating that such action is not warranted. Notice of such hearing shall precede consideration of the matter by at least ten days, shall be served personally or by mail to the address of the licensee listed on the licensee's most recent liquor license application to the city, and shall include a statement: 
1.  That it appears to the city council that there are concerns that a suspension and/or revocation of the licensee's license may be appropriate; 
2.  Summarizing the nature and date(s) of the incidents resulting in the concern(s); 
3.  That a hearing on the subject has been scheduled before the city council, and further informing the licensee of the time and place of the hearing; and 
4.  That the purpose of the hearing is to allow the licensee to offer corrections and/or contest the information before council which has given rise to the concern(s). 
A.  At a hearing, a licensee may appear in person or through counsel. A licensee will be given an opportunity to present evidence and argument on the relevant issue. Evidence relied on shall consist of information commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent people in the conduct of their serious affairs. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. A record shall be made of the proceeding and shall include the following: 
1.  All notices and intermediate rulings; 
2.  Evidence received or considered by the city council including information officially noticed and received from the municipal court; 
3.  Questions and offers of proof, objections and rulings thereon; 
4.  Any proposed findings and exceptions thereto; and 
5.  Any opinion, findings, decision or order of the city council and any report by any hearing officer. 
B.  Nothing shall preclude the city council from appointing one or more hearing examiners or officers to conduct any hearing called for by this section for the purpose of assembling a record for subsequent consideration by the city council. If a hearing examiner is appointed, the council shall direct the examiner to forward the record of the hearing to the council either with or without proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and with or without the opinion/recommendation of the examiner. 
C.  Following the hearing described in this section, and based upon the information considered and received at such hearing, and the sanctions described, the city council shall: 
1.  Order the suspension of the license in question; 
2.  Authorize the city attorney to prepare and file with the district court a petition to revoke the licensee's license; or 
3.  Find that suspension or revocation is not required by the terms of this section; 
4.  Place conditions upon the license and licensee which shall address concerns of the council which exist after the hearing. 
City council decisions shall be in writing, shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall be delivered to the licensee in interest either personally or by mail at the address listed on the licensee's most recent liquor license application to the city. 
D.  The city council's action suspending a licensee shall be subject to review in the district court in accordance with the procedural rules heretofore or hereinafter adopted by the Wyoming Supreme Court concerning the review of administrative actions. Filing an appeal as provided in such rules, stays enforcement of the suspension decision pending final order on the appeal. The city council's action may be set aside by the district court if it finds the action to be: 
1.  Arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law; 
2.  Without observance of the procedure required by law; or 
3.  Unsupported by substantial evidence. 
E.  If a license is revoked, except as provided in Wyoming Statutes Section 12-7-201(d) concerning the expiration of a licensee while a revocation order is under appeal, the holder of such revoked license shall not be eligible to apply for a new license for a period of twelve months from the date of revocation.

No sale or disposition may be made of such property held by any pawnbroker/secondhand dealer while the hold order remains outstanding. Any such hold order shall be effective for ninety days only, unless a criminal prosecution is undertaken with regard to any such property within such ninety-day period, in which event the hold order shall remain in effect until the prosecuting agency has notified the pawnbroker/secondhand dealer that the prosecution has been completed or dismissed. This shall be accomplished by issuing a release of property hold order form. 
2.  If any peace officer determines, after investigation, that any article of personal property held by a pawnbroker/secondhand dealer is stolen or illegally obtained property, such officer may take such property into evidence after giving the pawnbroker a receipt (Casper property evidence form) for it which sets forth the Casper police department case number as well as the reason for the confiscation.

If property that has been taken into custody by the Casper police department pursuant to this chapter is no longer needed for investigation or prosecution of a crime and no conviction for a crime involving the seized property has been obtained, the property shall be returned to its owner, as determined by the Casper police department. If a conviction has been obtained, the property shall be disposed of or returned, as determined by the court in which the conviction occurred. 
2.  If it appears that ownership of the property is in dispute between the pawnshop or secondhand dealer, and a person reporting the property stolen or otherwise claiming an interest in the property, before such return is completed, the department shall notify both the pawnshop or secondhand dealer from which it was seized and any other party claiming ownership of the item. 
3.  This notification shall be in the form of a letter describing the property, the initial department determination of the party to whom the property shall be returned, and a statement that if either party disagrees with that determination, they may file with the property and evidence division of the Casper police department, within fifteen days of the mailing of the letter, a request for judicial review of the ownership of the item. 
4.  Upon timely receipt of a request for review, the department shall notify the municipal court of said request. The municipal court shall then schedule, at its earliest convenience, a hearing on the matter. Notices of setting shall be sent by the court to the Casper police department property and evidence division, the Casper city attorney's office, the party making the objection to the return of the item, and the party to whom the department has proposed returning the item. 
5.  This review shall be an administrative hearing before the city of Casper municipal court, pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedures Act, with the burden being on the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence their ownership of the property. 
6.  If their burden is not met, or a request for hearing is not timely made, the property shall be returned to the owner as determined by the department, after thirty days from the date of the notification letter, or in compliance with the order of the court, as applicable.

The amounts so payable by Grantee shall not be in addition to any other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes or charges which might otherwise be levied or collected by the City from Grantee in respect to Grantee's electric business or of the exercise of this franchise within the corporate limits of the City, and the amount of any such license, occupation, franchise, or excise taxes or other charges for corresponding periods shall be reduced by deducting therefrom the franchise fee or charge payable hereunder by Grantee; provided that, this provision shall not apply or pertain to lawful ad valorem taxes levied by the City or other public authority against Grantee's property within the City. 
The records of the Company pertaining to the franchise fee required in this Section shall be open for inspection by the City and its duly authorized representatives at reasonable hours for the purpose of verification. The Company will advise the City of the identity of consumers and suppliers of electric power wheeled by the Company to consumers within the City, to the extent the Company is able to provide such information. 
Section 7. 
Grantee shall protect and save the City, its officers, employees and agents, harmless against and from any and all damage, claim and any and all loss, liability, cost or expense, occasioned by any negligent act or omission of Grantee in the construction, maintenance, operation or repair of Grantee's property or any use thereof, and Grantee shall at all times comply with any lawful present or future ordinances, rules or regulations of the City relating to the manner of occupation or use, or to the repair or improvement of said streets. 
Section 8. 
Performance of Grantee's obligations hereunder shall be subject to and suspended during prevention thereof or interference therewith, by action of or under governmental authority claiming jurisdiction, or by Acts of God, adverse weather, supply, labor or other conditions not wholly controlled by Grantee, but prevention of such obligations shall not relieve Grantee from any monthly payment aforesaid to the City, and providing further that as soon as the act or actions or other conditions causing the suspension have been removed or cease to exist, Grantee shall forthwith resume the suspended operations. 
Section 9. 
The Grantee and the City recognize that many aspects of the electric utility industry are currently the subject of discussion, examination and inquiry by different segments of the industry and affected regulatory authorities and that these activities may ultimately result in fundamental changes in the way the Grantee conducts its business and meets its service obligations. In recognition of the present state of uncertainty respecting these matters, the Grantee and the City each agree, on request of the other during the term of this Franchise, to meet with the other and discuss in good faith whether it would be appropriate, in view of developments of the kind referred to above during the term of this Franchise, to amend this Franchise or enter into separate, mutually satisfactory arrangements to effect a proper accommodation of any such developments. 
Section 10. 
Upon the effective date hereof, but not otherwise, Ordinance No. 1694-A of the City of Casper, passed and approved May 21, 1973, granting a franchise to Grantee is hereby repealed. 
Section 11. 
This ordinance shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City, pursuant to Section 15-1-116 of the Wyoming statutes and shall become effective on the day following said publication, but shall become null and void unless within sixty (60) days after such effective date the Grantee shall file in the office of the Clerk the Grantee's unqualified written acceptance of all the provisions thereof.

    The City shall have the right, upon written notice to Company, to renegotiate the terms of Sections 3 and 4 of this ordinance, and amend the same accordingly every five (5) years during the term hereof. The purpose of said renegotiation and amendment shall be to allow the City the ability to update this ordinance to conform with then existing practices and procedures for use of streets and construction standards. 
    Section 3: Use of Streets. 
    The Company's facilities shall be located, constructed, and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger the lives or property of the City or its citizens or interfere with any improvements the City may deem proper to make, or hinder or obstruct the free use of streets by the public. Whenever it shall be necessary in the location, construction, or maintenance of the facilities to dig, or in any manner disturb or interfere with any of the streets, the Company shall, at its own cost and expense immediately thereafter, and in a manner approved by the City, replace and restore such streets disturbed in as good a condition as before said work was commenced and in accordance with standards for such work set by City Ordinance or by the City Engineer. In the event any street shall become uneven, unsettled, or otherwise require repairing because of the disturbance by the Company, then the Company shall promptly upon receipt of notice from the City to do so, cause said street to be repaired or restored to a good condition, and in compliance with the ordinances and standards of the City. 
    In the event that at any time during the period of this Franchise the City shall lawfully elect to make necessary public improvements in or upon any street to alter or change the grade of any street or City owned land, the Company upon reasonable notice by the City, shall promptly remove or relocate as necessary its facilities at its own expense, and all streets disturbed by the Company shall be restored by it to as good a condition as before said disturbance and in compliance with the standards required by the City.

Notice of street closure shall be given to the City Engineer as soon as reasonably possible. 
    The Company is required to meet on an annual basis with the City Engineer to inform and advise the City Engineer of its plans for repair or replacement of existing facilities or installation of new facilities within or under existing improved, or unimproved, streets or future City streets. The purpose of such meeting shall be to so advise the City in order that it may properly plan and coordinate its activities regarding street repair or replacement with the Company and other utility companies. In addition, the Company shall be required, at its expense, to provide the City with a plan for repair or replacement of existing facilities or installation of new facilities within or under existing improved, or unimproved, streets or future City streets at least thirty (30) days prior to commencement of actual work. Where practical, facilities being installed under improved streets shall be pushed or bored under such streets in such a manner that the existing improved street is not disturbed unless open cutting has been previously approved by the City Engineer' Office. 
    Whenever the Company is working in any street, proper and adequate warning signs shall be used, as required by and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer's Office and any applicable City Ordinance or State Statute. In the event a street is left unrepaired at the end of a normal working day, the Company shall perform all necessary cleanup work and erect and monitor such signs as are adequate to provide notice to the public of the street conditions, said cleanup and signage shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer's Office. 
    Any street opening made for installation or repair of facilities shall be closed within a maximum of five (5) working days of the making of the opening; and said opening shall be permanently repaired and resurfaced to City standards, unless the City Engineer's Office grants a time extension. In any event, said street opening shall be subject to permit approval by the City Engineer's Office in accordance with any ordinance regulating the same during the term of this Franchise. In the event the Company shall fail to close any street opening within the maximum period specified herein, the City shall be, and is, hereby authorized by the Company to repair and resurface the street opening; and the Company agrees to pay all costs incurred by the City in doing the same upon demand of the City. In the discretion of the City, and prior to opening a street, the Company shall deposit cash or post bond in lieu thereof with the City, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) to be used in the event Company fails to close said street to a condition satisfactory to the City Engineer's Office within the time specified. Upon the failure of the Company to close a street opening in the time specified, for failure to make such cash deposit or post bond when notified by the City Engineer's Office to do so, or both, the Company shall be refused any permit or permits thereafter required to be issued or obtained for the opening of any streets in the City. 
    Section 4: Construction Standards. 
    All buildings and facilities erected by Company for the purposes of conducting its business for which this Franchise is given, shall comply with the ordinances of the City in effect at the time of the commencement of construction of said buildings and facilities.

    Section 6: Franchise Fee. 
    As consideration for the Franchise hereby granted, Company shall pay to the City an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Company's gross revenue as said term is herein defined. The Company agrees that the Franchise Fee constitutes a legitimate cost of doing business and is a reasonable amount of rental for use of City streets. Payments of said amount shall be made quarterly on or before the 20th day after the quarter has ended for each quarter during the term of this Franchise, and shall be computed upon the gross revenue earned during said quarter or portion thereof. The quarterly payments are due and delinquent if not paid as set forth above. Quarter, as herein defined, means each consecutive three month period during the term of this Franchise commencing January 1, 1984. 
    The amounts so payable by Company shall not be in addition to any other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes, or charges which might otherwise be levied or collected by the City from Company in respect to Company's telephone and telegraph business, or the exercise of this Franchise within the corporate limits of the City and the amount of any such license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes, or other charges for corresponding periods shall be reduced by deducting therefrom the franchise fee or charge payable hereunder by the Company; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply or pertain to lawful ad valorem taxes levied by the City or other public authority against the Company's property within the City. 
    Section 7: Assignment. 
    The Company may assign or transfer this Franchise and all rights and obligations hereunder with the permission of the City. Said assignment or transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld by the City. Upon assignment or transfer of this Franchise, the transferee or assignee shall become entitled to all the rights and privileges herein granted and shall assume all of the obligations and liabilities as provided herein. Said assignment or transfer shall not relieve the Company from its obligations and liabilities as provided herein unless specifically provided by the City. 
    Section 8: Police Powers. 
    The Company acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such power. 
    Any conflict between the provisions of this Franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's police power shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of a general application in the jurisdiction, or applies exclusively to the Company or to telephone and telegraph suppliers within the City, which contain provisions inconsistent with this Franchise, shall prevail only if upon such exercise, the City finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare, or such exercise is mandated by law. 
    Section 9: Indemnification. 
    Company shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions, and employees against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments for damages, including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements and liabilities assumed by the City in connection therewith: 
a. to persons or property in any way arising out of or through the acts or omissions of the Company, its servants, agents or employees, or to which the Company's negligence shall in any way contribute; b. arising out of Company's failure to comply with the provisions of any Federal, State, or local Statute, Ordinance, or Regulation applicable to the Company in its business hereunder.  
    Section 10: Waiver. 
    The waiver of any breach of any of the terms or conditions of this Franchise shall be limited to the act or acts constituting such breach, and shall never be construed as being a continuing or permanent waiver of any such terms or conditions, all of which shall be and remain in full force and effect as to future acts or happenings notwithstanding any such individual waiver of any breach thereof. 
    Section 11: Default and Termination. 
    In the event the Company shall make default in the observance or performance of any one or more of the agreements, duties, or obligations imposed upon it by this ordinance, and if any such default or defaults shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to the Company from the City stating the alleged default on the part of the Company, and the Company fails to take action necessary to cure said default, then and in each and every case, the City, in addition to all other rights and remedies allowed by law, shall be entitled to terminate the Franchise made to the Company by this ordinance, and all rights and privileges of the Company under this ordinance shall thereupon be at an end. Provided, however, that the Company shall not be considered to be in default and be excused from performance at all times during which the Company may be delayed or interfered with by unavoidable accidents, acts of God, action of or under governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Company, labor strikes, or other conditions not controlled by, or brought about by, the actions of the Company; provided, however, that excuse from performance shall not relieve Company from any quarterly payment, as provided herein, to the City. 
    Section 12: Effective Date. 
    This ordinance shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City, pursuant to Wyoming Statutes, and shall become effective on the day following said publication, but shall become null and void unless within sixty (60) days after such effective date, the Company shall file in the Office of the City Clerk the Company's unqualified written acceptance of all of the provisions hereof.

AN ORDINANCE GRANTING TO KN ENERGY, A DIVISION OF KINDER MORGAN, INC., A CORPORATION, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, THE RIGHT, PERMISSION AND AUTHORITY TO CONSTRUCT, MAINTAIN AND OPERATE A GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, INCLUDING MAINS, PIPES, CONDUITS, SERVICES AND OTHER STRUCTURES, IN, UNDER, UPON, OVER, ACROSS AND ALONG THE STREETS, ALLEYS, BRIDGES AND PUBLIC PLACES WITHIN THE PRESENT AND FUTURE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THE CITY OF CASPER, WYOMING, FOR THE FURNISHING, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF GAS WHETHER ARTIFICIAL, NATURAL, MIXED OR OTHERWISE FOR LIGHTING, HEATING, DOMESTIC, INDUSTRIAL AND OTHER USES IN SAID CITY AND ELSEWHERE, LIMITING THE TERM OF SAID GRANT, PRESCRIBING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SAID COMPANY MAY OPERATE. 
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CITY OF CASPER, WYOMING: 
SECTION 1. PURPOSE. 
The City of Casper, Natrona County, Wyoming, hereinafter called "City", does hereby grant to KN Energy, a Division of Kinder Morgan, Inc., a corporation authorized to do business in the State of Wyoming, its successors and assigns, hereinafter collectively referred to as "Franchisee", a nonexclusive right to construct, maintain and operate a gas transmission and distribution system within the limits of Casper, the inhabitants thereof, and persons and corporations within and beyond the limits of the City, subject to the terms and conditions and to making of payments hereinafter specified. 
SECTION 2. USE OF STREETS AND PUBLIC GROUNDS/RESTORATION OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY. 
2.1  General Conditions on Use. 
a. Franchisee is authorized to make excavations in City streets, alleys and public rights-of-way for purposes of routine repair, replacement and maintenance of system components associated with the gas transmission and distribution system. Franchisee shall obtain excavation permits for streets and alleys, regardless of surfacing types, and traffic control permits for all streets, and shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of streets, alleys or public rights-of-way. All mains, services, and pipes laid or installed under this franchise shall be so located and laid as not to obstruct or interfere with any water pipes, drains, sewers or other structures already installed, and all such mains, services and pipes shall be installed subject to approval of the City Manager or his/her designee. 
  Franchisee, in doing any work in connection with said mains, pipes and services shall avoid, so far as practicable, interfering with the use of any street, alley or public place, and where the paving or surface of any street, alley or public place is disturbed, Franchisee at its own expense and in a manner satisfactory to the City Manager or his/her designee shall replace such paving or surface in accordance with the City of Casper's Standard Specifications for Street Construction, Chapters 12.16 and 16.18 of this code, and any other applicable ordinances. 
b. Paved streets shall be bored or drilled when they are crossed beneath the ground by Franchisee's network so that the City's paved streets will not be unnecessarily damaged. The City Manager or his/her designee, in his sole discretion, may allow other construction methods when it is found that drilling or boring is unreasonable and will not provide a sufficient public benefit for the cost. 
c. Franchisee at all times will keep a map in the office of Franchisee and in the City Engineer's Office of said City showing the size and approximate location of its mains laid in said distribution system in said City. The map will be replaced each year with a revised map showing the new construction for the previous calendar year. 
d. Before commencing any major extension or expansion of the gas transmission and distribution system, or any major repair work, Franchisee shall file with the City a written statement describing the public property and/or right-of-way under which, or upon which, it proposes to extend, expand, install or repair the lines included in the gas transmission and distribution system. The City may require that the notification be accompanied by a map, plan or specifications showing the proposed location of the gas transmission and distribution system components with reference to streets and alleys, the size and dimensions of all facilities, a schedule for the proposed work, and the distance above or beneath the surface of the ground where it is proposed that a repair or installation is to occur. If the proposed locations of any facilities shall interfere with the reasonable and proper use, construction, reconstruction, and maintenance of any public improvements or any existing City-owned public utility system facility, or other structure upon or under public property, the City shall, within a reasonable time after the filing of such plan, map or specifications note the changes necessary, and refer the same back to Franchisee for amendment. Such map, plan or specifications, when properly changed and corrected, shall be filed with the City. Unless otherwise provided in a lawful order or decision of the Public Service Commission, all work shall be in accordance with the approved maps, plans or specifications. If work is not completed on schedule, City reserves right to complete the work at Franchisee's expense. 
e. This franchise does not establish priority for use of public rights-of-way over holders of other permits or franchises; it grants no vested interest in occupying any particular position in the public rights-of-way. The City shall control distribution of space in the public rights-of-way, but may not exercise that authority unreasonably. No location of any gas line shall give rise to a vested interest in public property, and such lines or structures shall be removed or modified by Franchisee whenever the City reasonably determines that the public interest will be enhanced thereby. 
f. Franchisee in the construction of said gas system within the limits of said City shall use tested and approved pipes, material and equipment. 
g. All excavation shall be performed so as to create the least inconvenience to the public, and in accordance with permits and manuals issued by the City. In doing any work in connection with said mains, pipes and services, Franchisee shall avoid, so for as practicable, interfering with the use of any street, alley or public place. 
2.2  No Hindrance to Public Works and Improvements. 
a. Franchisee shall, at Franchisee's own expense, by a time specified by the City protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the City for reasons of traffic conditions, public health and safety, public rights of way new construction or repair, or for any municipal project including change of grade, new construction, installation or repair of sewers, drainages, waterlines, power lines or any government-owned communication system, public work or improvement, or any government-owned utility, public right-of-way vacation, or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided in the sole benefit of the City by the removal or relocation of the facility. Except in the case of emergency, the City shall provide reasonable notice describing where the work is to be performed not less than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the deadline by which Franchisee must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities, at no expense to the City. Additional time may be granted due to weather conditions. If, after thirty (30) business days from the deadline provided in the written notice, Franchisee fails to remove or relocate its facilities as required by the City, the City may remove or relocate, or have removed or relocated, Franchisee's gas transmission and distribution system, and Franchisee shall compensate the City for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby. 
b. If at any time hereafter City shall lawfully elect to change or alter the grade of any street, alley or public place, or to construct new or additional utility service lines, Franchisee, at its own expense, upon being directed to do so by the City Manager or his/her designee, shall, move or relay its mains or service pipes. City shall confer with Franchisee and seek Franchisee's input during the initial planning and engineering phase of any change of grade or replacement or construction of lines, and City shall take reasonable steps to avoid or minimize the need for Franchisee to move or relay its mains or service pipes. 
SECTION 3. TERM. 
The right and authority herein granted shall continue for a period of ten (10) years; provided, however, that the City Council reserves the right, during the term of this agreement, to renegotiate the provisions of this ordinance with Franchisee, its successors or assigns, and in the event that such negotiations shall not have resulted in a mutually agreeable amendment to said franchise within a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, then and in such event, the City, reserves the right to cancel this franchise by repeal of this ordinance. 
SECTION 4. RATES. 
a. Franchisee shall furnish for public and private use during the term hereof and under the conditions of this franchise, natural gas and natural energy at the rates and prices and in accordance with tariffs filed and fixed by the Public Service Commission of the State of Wyoming or approved by said Commission and in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Wyoming. 
b. Whenever the delivery or supply capability of Franchisee's system, due to any cause whatsoever not limited to force majeure, is such that Franchisee is unable to deliver to consumers served by Franchisee the quantity of gas which the consumers require, Franchisee shall have the right to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations for allocating the available quantities of gas among such consumers. 
SECTION 5. FRANCHISE FEE. 
As consideration for all franchise rights and contractual privileges granted by the City under the franchise hereby granted, Franchisee shall pay to the City in quarterly payments for each year of the duration of this franchise, in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the gross receipts derived quarterly by the Franchisee from sales of gas delivered to residential (commonly known as domestic) and commercial gas users within the City of Casper, Wyoming. Payment shall be made on or before June 1 for the first quarter of said year, on or before September 1 for the second quarter of said year, on or before December 1 for the third quarter of said year, and on or before March 1 for the last quarter of the preceding year. Each such payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the total amount of the gross receipts upon the basis of which the computation for such payment was made. 
If Franchisee implements its Choice Gas Program as described in its Wyoming PSC Tariff No. 2 or a similar unbundling program within the City of Casper, the franchise fee provisions set forth in this Section shall be revised by mutual agreement so as to provide the City with approximately the same level of revenue which the City was receiving prior to such implementation, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Franchisee shall proceed with due diligence and good faith to obtain such approvals or tariff changes as may be necessary to effectuate any revisions to the franchise fee provisions in Section 5. 
All permits required by City code or regulations shall be acquired and paid for by Franchisee. All permits and fees shall be paid before any work on any gas transmission or distribution facility commences. All work performed shall be performed in strict accordance with such permits and ordinances. 
SECTION 6. REPORTING. 
Each Franchise Fee payment shall be accompanied by a form, satisfactory to the City, reporting sources, and the amount of gross revenues by source. Franchisee shall annually provide a Franchise Fee Report showing total revenues received, by category. The forms must be prepared and signed by a certified public accountant, or attested to by the person principally responsible for the financial operations of Franchisee. Any deductions from the Fee due shall be noted on the form. 
SECTION 7. RIGHT TO AUDIT. 
The City shall have the right to audit records to ensure compliance with this Franchise Fee section, including records regarding revenues of the network, without regard to who holds that information, and without regard to who receives the revenue. The City shall give reasonable written notice of its intent to audit. It is Franchisee's responsibility to collect and to make available to the City, at Franchisee's local office, records of all revenues on which a fee is required to be paid. If a City review of payments shows that Franchisee has underpaid the Franchise Fee by more than 7% for the year, Franchisee shall bear the cost of the audit as part of its cure of any underpayment. 
SECTION 8. LIABILITY, INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE. 
Franchisee shall be required, and by the acceptance hereof agrees, to full indemnify, defend, hold harmless, protect and save the City, its council, manager, officers, employees and agents, harmless from and against all damage, lawful claims and demands, and from any and all loss, liability, cost or expense, necessarily incurred as a result thereof, arising out of any negligent act or omission of Franchisee in the construction, removal, maintenance, operation replacement, inspection or repair of Franchisee's property or in the use and operation thereof, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees incurred, and Franchisee shall at all times comply with any lawful present or future ordinances, rules or regulations of the City relating to the manner of occupation or use, or to the repair or improvement of said streets and property. 
SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS. 
9.1   Entering Upon Private Property. 
Franchisee shall have the right, when properly identified, to enter the premises of consumers at reasonable hours for the purpose of reading meters, to examine the piping, appliances, and other equipment relating to Franchisee's service and to ascertain loads and make necessary tests. 
9.2   Effect of Preemption; Federal and State Law. 
Franchisee and City must comply with all applicable provisions of Federal and State law. If the City's ability to enforce any Franchise provision is preempted, then the provision shall be deemed preempted, but only to the extent and for the period the preemption is required by law. If, as a result of a change in law or otherwise, the provision would again be enforceable, it shall be enforceable without the requirement of further action on the City's part. 
Franchisee shall have the right to make all such reasonable rules and regulations in the conduct of its business as it may deem necessary or expedient, including meter deposits in such amounts as may be required to assure payment of bills. Franchisee shall make such reasonable extensions of its mains from time to time and shall install service to the curb line where mains are located in a street, and to property line where mains are located in an alley, as may be required to furnish service within the City to parties making application therefor, and in compliance with Franchisee's tariff as filed with the Wyoming Public Service Commission; but Franchisee shall not be required to make any extension for the purpose of serving any consumer or consumers if Franchisee is, for any reason, unable to obtain an adequate supply of gas to warrant the construction of said extension. 
9.3   Severability . 
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Franchise is for any reason held illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any State or Federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion hereof. 
SECTION 10. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its final passage and publication, pursuant to Section 15-1-116 of the Wyoming Statutes and become effective on the day following said publication, but shall become null and void unless within sixty (60) days after such effective date the Franchisee shall file in the office of the Clerk the Franchisee's unqualified written acceptance of all the provisions thereof.

SECTION 5. FRANCHISE FEE. 
As consideration for all franchise rights and contractual privileges granted by the City under the franchise hereby granted, Franchisee shall pay to the City in quarterly payments for each year of the duration of this franchise, in an amount equal to $0.0225 per therm of gas delivered during each respective quarter to residential (commonly known as domestic) and commercial gas users within the City of Casper, Wyoming. Payment shall be made on or before June 1 for the first quarter of said year, on or before September 1 for the second quarter of said year, on or before December 1 for the third quarter of said year, and on or before March 1 for the last quarter of the preceding year. Each such payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the total amount of therms upon the basis of which the computation for such payment was made. 
If Franchisee implements its Choice Gas Program as described in its Wyoming PSC Tariff No. 2 or a similar unbundling program within the City of Casper, the franchise fee provisions set forth in this Section shall be revised by mutual agreement so as to provide the City with approximately the same level of revenue which the City was receiving prior to such implementation, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Franchisee shall proceed with due diligence and good faith to obtain such approvals or tariff changes as may be necessary to effectuate any revisions to the franchise fee provisions in Section 5. 
All permits required by City code or regulations shall be acquired and paid for by Franchisee. All permits and fees shall be paid before any work on any gas transmission or distribution facility commences. All work performed shall be performed in strict accordance with such permits and ordinances. 
SECTION 6. REPORTING. 
Each Franchise Fee payment shall be accompanied by a form, satisfactory to the City, reporting sources, and the amount of therms delivered to each source.

The forms must be prepared and signed by a certified public accountant, or attested to by the person principally responsible for the financial operations of Franchisee. Any deductions from the Fee due shall be noted on the form. 
SECTION 7. RIGHT TO AUDIT. 
The City shall have the right to audit records to ensure compliance with the Franchise Fee section, including records regarding transportation in therms of the network, without regard to who holds that information, and without regard to who receives the natural gas. The City shall give reasonable written notice of its intent to audit. It is Franchisee's responsibility to collect and to make available to the City, at Franchisee's local office, records of all therms on which a fee is required to be paid. If a City review of payments shows that Franchisee has underpaid the Franchise Fee by more than 7% for the year, Franchisee shall bear the cost of the audit as part of its cure of any underpayment. 
SECTION 8. LIABILITY, INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE. 
Franchisee shall be required, and by the acceptance hereof agrees, to fully indemnify, defend, hold harmless, protect and save the City, its council, manager, officers, employees and agents, harmless from and against all damage, lawful claims and demands, and from any and all loss, liability, cost or expense, necessarily incurred as a result thereof, arising out of any negligent act or omission of Franchisee in the construction, removal, maintenance, operation replacement, inspection or repair of Franchisee's property or in the use and operation thereof, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees incurred, and Franchisee shall at all times comply with any lawful present or future ordinances, rules or regulations of the City relating to the manner of occupation or use, or to the repair or improvement of said streets and property. 
The City does not waive any right or rights it may have pursuant to the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act, W.S. § 1-39-101, et seq., and the City specifically reserves the right to assert any and all rights, immunities, and defenses it may have pursuant to the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act.

Subject to all conditions precedent being satisfied, the effective date of this Franchise shall be the date that the Grantee files its acceptance with the City Clerk. 
2.4 ;hg; Rights Reserved . The City reserves its rights under its lawful police powers. The City, among other things, does not waive any rights it may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552 or any requirements of local law or regulations as amended, including zoning codes, codes regarding building permits and fees, or time or manner of construction in accordance with Chapter 16.18 of the Casper City Code, pertaining to standard specifications for street construction, and all other applicable codes. Grantee is also required, by virtue of this commitment, to obtain pole attachment contracts and to pay a fee for pole and conduit use that shall not be considered part of the Franchise fee established by this Ordinance. Any other fees or charges paid, including permit fees, to the extent they are not by Federal law deemed to be a Franchise fee shall be paid in addition to the Franchise fee required under this Franchise.

In addition to maintaining all other books and records it is required to maintain under this Franchise, for at least three (3) years after the effective date of this Franchise, the Grantee shall retain books and records from its operations under the Franchise, which are necessary to the enforcement of the Franchise, in a form and location easily accessible to the City.

Grantee shall be notified of that proceeding, and shall be given an opportunity to appear in the proceeding and to present evidence relevant to the determination of future cable-related needs and interests and any impact on the existing provision of Cable Service. 
b. ;hg;The terms and conditions of any franchise granted after the effective date of this Franchise shall be substantially similar to those contained herein in order that one multi channel video provider not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another. However, nothing in this provision shall be construed in such a way as to limit the City's authority to enter into other franchises. 
SECTION 3. USE OF STREETS AND PUBLIC GROUNDS. 
3.1 ;hg; General Conditions on Use . 
a. ;hg;The Grantee may not endanger nor unreasonably interfere with the lives or property of persons; unreasonably interfere with property of the City or any public utility; or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct use of the Public Ways. The Franchise does not establish priority for use of Public Ways over holders of other permits or franchises; it grants no vested interest in occupying any particular position in the Public Ways. The City shall control distribution of space in the Public Ways, but may not exercise that authority unreasonably. No location of any pole or wire-holding structure shall give rise to a vested interest in City property or Public Ways and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the Grantee whenever the City reasonably determines that the public interest will be enhanced thereby. 
b. ;hg;The System shall be installed in Public Ways and other places within the limits of the City, subject to the inspection of and in close cooperation and coordination with the City Manager or his/her designee. All cable placed under streets, roads and other Public Ways crossed by vehicular traffic shall be placed in conduit. 
c. ;hg;Without obtaining the prior written approval of the City, the Grantee shall not install or erect its System in or on public property, rights-of-way or in any privately-owned area within the City that has not yet become a Public Way but is designated or delineated as a proposed Public Way on any subdivision plat submitted for approval by the City, except insofar as the System may be installed or erected on public utility facilities then existing. 
d. ;hg;The Grantee shall expeditiously carry out all of its operations during the course of any construction, repairs or maintenance operations on Public Ways of the Grantee. 
e. ;hg;If the Grantee performs any excavation or other construction in any portion of any Public Way, Grantee shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the public using such Public Ways from harm including by erecting proper barriers and warning facilities. All barriers and related signs shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. Paved streets shall be bored or drilled when they are crossed beneath the ground by Grantee's System so that the City's paved streets will not be unnecessarily damaged. The City Manager or his/her designee, in its sole discretion, may allow other construction methods when he finds that drilling or boring is unreasonable and will not provide a sufficient public benefit for the cost. All excavation shall be performed so as to create the least inconvenience to the public, and in accordance with permits and manuals issued by the City. The City shall have the right to supervise all excavation. 
f. ;hg;Grantee shall bury or suspend each of its service lines from its main trunk lines to individual customers. In no event shall it allow its cable to lie upon the ground except as may be necessary during actual construction or repair to the service line, and in no event shall it be allowed to remain upon the ground for more than sixty (60) calendar days, provided that Grantee is not required to bury its cable between October 15 and April 15 where the weather prevents it. Subject to the foregoing, in the event the Grantee fails to bury any cable within sixty (60) calendar days, then the City shall give the Grantee a written objection to the delay. If Grantee fails to perform the work within ten (10) business days after receipt of the notice, the City may have the cable buried. The Grantee shall compensate the City for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with this work. 
3.2 ;hg; No Hindrance to Public Works and Improvements. 
a. ;hg;Grantee shall, at its cost, install, construct, operate, and maintain its Cable System as directed by the City so as to permit the City to install, construct, maintain, or operate any public works, public improvements, or other publicly-owned facilities or systems. 
b. ;hg;The Grantee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove its Cable System as requested by the City for reasons of traffic conditions, public health and safety, and protection of property, construction, repair, maintenance or relocation of any Public Way, grade change, or construction, relocation, installation or maintenance of any public works, public improvements, or other publicly-owned facilities or systems. If, after fifteen (15) business days from the deadline provided in the written notice, Grantee fails to remove or relocate its System as required by the City, the City may remove or relocate Grantee's Cable System, and Grantee shall compensate the City for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby, provided, however, the Grantee shall, in all cases, have the right of abandonment of its property where such property is located underground. 
c. ;hg;The Grantee, upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice from the City Manager or his/her designee, shall supply the City with maps showing the location of its facilities as the City may require for the design and planning of Public Ways and public works, public improvements and other public facilities and systems. This Section does not require the Grantee to provide as-built maps unless those are the only maps that show the actual location of the Grantee's facilities. Thereafter, the Grantee shall not move or alter the location of the portion of its System specifically located by the terms of this paragraph without compliance with the general notice requirements of this Franchise. The notice shall state that the portion of the System moved had been located for City design and planning purposes. The Grantee shall maintain membership in the Central Wyoming Utilities Coordinating Council, or its successor and abide by its bylaws, rules and regulations. 
3.3 ;hg; Removal or Relocation in Event of Emergency . 
In event of emergency, or where the Cable System creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the City may remove or relocate Grantee's Cable System without prior notice. 
3.4 ;hg; Relation to Penalties for Failure to Provide Service . 
The Grantee shall not be penalized by the City for any failure to provide Cable Service which results from relocation or removal under Section 3.2 or 3.3. 
3.5 ;hg; Restoration of Public Ways and Private Property . 
a. ;hg;The Grantee shall expeditiously carry out all of its operations during the course of any construction, operation or maintenance operations on public or private property. Grantee shall protect or support public or private property to prevent damage caused by construction, installation, maintenance, or operation of its Cable System. If Grantee fails to protect such property, the City may do so, and Grantee shall compensate the City for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby. Grantee, without undue delay, and at its expense, shall restore, repair, or replace public or private property to as good a condition as prior to the disturbance, or compensate property owners for damage caused by Grantee. Restoration, repair or replacement of Public Ways shall be completed within at least ten (10) business days, and restoration, repair or replacement of private property with the exception of Grantee's private property not used in the construction, operation or maintenance of the Cable System, shall be completed within at least thirty (30) calendar days except in those cases where the restoration, by its nature, cannot be completed in that period even with the exercise of due diligence and the City has authorized an extension of the restoration period. Grantee shall take all proper steps to ensure that any resurfacing or reconstruction of Public Ways rests upon a properly filled and tamped foundation. The City may elect to repair or replace public property so damaged, such as sewage line, and request reimbursement from Grantee for the reasonable expenses associated with the repair or replacement. Subject to the foregoing, Grantee may trim trees and other vegetation from Public Ways, at its expense and subject, at the City's option, to the City's supervision. Upon request and for good cause shown, the City Manager or his/her designee may authorize an extension of the period within which the Grantee may perform its restoration work. 
b. ;hg;Grantee shall notify any person whose property is damaged by Grantee within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the damage is discovered. At a minimum, this Section requires Grantee to place a prominent notice in a prominent place on the damaged property, and to make diligent efforts to contact the property owner or resident directly. 
3.6 ;hg; Use of Grantee's Equipment by City . 
Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable State or Federal regulations or laws, the City shall have the right to make additional use, at no cost for any public purpose, of any poles or conduits controlled or maintained exclusively by or for the Grantee in any Public Way; provided that: (a) such use by the City does not unduly interfere with a current or future use by the Grantee; and (b) the City holds the Grantee harmless against and from all claims, demands, costs, or liabilities of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of the acts or omissions of the City in connection with its use of said poles or conduits, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; and (c) such use by the city is restricted to non-commercial municipal purposes and the City shall take reasonable precautions to prevent use of the Grantee's System in any manner that results in inappropriate use. If such use increases Grantee's operating costs, City shall reimburse Grantee the amount of such incremental increased cost. At such time the parties shall cooperate to reach agreement concerning on-going maintenance. 
3.7 ;hg; Aerial and Underground Construction . 
With regard to all areas of new construction or line extension, where the distribution facilities of public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are located underground, the Grantee likewise shall locate its Cable System underground. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as Subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related equipment. For purposes of this Section, "undergrounding" shall include a partial underground system. Amplifiers on the Cable System may be in appropriate housings upon the surface of the ground. 
3.8 ;hg; Relocation at Request of Third Party . 
Grantee shall raise or lower wires or equipment upon the reasonable request of any third party, including any Person holding a building moving permit, provided: (a) the expenses associated with raising and lowering the wires or equipment is paid by the person requesting the same, including if requested by Grantee making such payment in advance; and, (b) the Grantee is given not less than ten (10) business days advance written notice by the person requesting the movement. In such instance, the Grantee may require the Person requesting removal or relocation to pay reasonable estimated costs associated with the work in advance. Notwithstanding the above, the Grantee shall bear costs associated with removing or relocating that portion of its Cable System located on the property of the Person requesting removal or relocation. 
3.9 ;hg; Construction Standards . 
The construction, installation, operation, and maintenance of the Cable System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. In addition to requirements of local law and conditions established by the utilities whose facilities are used by the System, all such work shall be performed in accordance with good engineering practices, in accordance with at least the following safety, construction, and technical specifications and codes and standards, as they may now exist or be amended or adopted hereafter: 
a. ;hg;National Electrical Code; 
b. ;hg;National Electrical Safety Code (NESC); 
c. ;hg;Obstruction Marking and Lighting, AC 70/7460; Federal Aviation Administration; 
d. ;hg;All Federal, State, and Municipal Construction Requirements, including FCC Rules and Regulations; and, 
e. ;hg;Local building and zoning codes, and all land use restrictions and local safety codes. 
The City may to the extent consistent with its policing powers from time to time adopt additional standards of general applicability as appropriate to assure work is performed in a safe and workmanlike manner. 
3.10 ;hg; Subcontractors . 
All contractors or subcontractors shall be properly licensed, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with respect to its work as Grantee would have under this Franchise and applicable laws if the work were performed by Grantee. Grantee shall be responsible for ensuring that the work of contractors and subcontractors is performed consistent with the Franchise and applicable law; that all contractors and subcontractors are familiar with their responsibilities. 
3.11 ;hg; No Recourse . 
In addition to any immunities Casper may have under Federal or State law, the Grantee shall have no recourse against the City for any damages suffered as a result of the City's exercise of any rights or combination of rights under this Franchise, or as a result of any damages suffered by the Grantee by virtue of its compliance with this Franchise or the lawful enforcement of the same. 
3.12 ;hg; Horizontal and Vertical Locations . 
The Grantee is responsible for providing to the City, upon request, the horizontal and vertical location of all of Grantee's underground facilities in public right-of-ways and utility easements. In the event state law is amended, modified or repealed, then the parties shall comply. 
SECTION 4. SYSTEM FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, AND SERVICES. 
4.1 System Maintenance . 
a. ;hg;Interruptions to be Minimized. The Grantee shall schedule maintenance of the System so that interruptions are minimized far as reasonably possible, and so that activities likely to result in an interruption of service are performed during periods of minimum Subscriber use of the system. 
b. ;hg;Maintenance Practices. In addition to its other obligations, Grantee shall use replacement components of good and durable quality, with characteristics better or equal to replaced equipment. 
4.2 ;hg; System Performance . 
The City may regulate technical standards for the System to the fullest extent permitted by Federal law and regulations. 
4.3 ;hg; Provision of Service to Subscribers; System Extension . 
a. ;hg;The Grantee shall build its System so that it is capable of providing Cable Service to all residences, public schools, and City Office buildings located within the Service Area as of the effective date of this Franchise. 
b. ;hg;Cable Service will be extended at then-prevailing installation charges except as provided below under the following circumstances: 
1. ;hg;Where the Grantee may locate a drop above ground, but the Subscriber requests to locate his cable drop underground, the Grantee shall locate the drop underground, but in addition to the prevailing installation charge may charge the Subscriber for the actual difference in cost of installing the underground, rather than the aerial drop. 
2. ;hg;Where the drop to the Subscriber home is more than one hundred and fifty (150) feet in length, or where there is a density of less than ten (10) residences within one thousand three hundred and twenty (1,320) cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, the System shall be extended on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction to cover the Subscriber's share of the cost of material, labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by Grantee and Subscribers in the area in which Cable Service is extended, Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per quarter mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per one thousand three hundred and twenty (1,320) cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals ten (10). Persons requesting service hereunder will bear the remainder of the estimated construction costs on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require that the estimated payment of the Subscriber's share of the capital contribution aid of construction be paid in advance. When the extension is completed, the Grantee shall send an itemized invoice showing the actual cost of the extension, but may not require a Subscriber to pay more than its estimated share. Any excess amounts collected in advance must be returned to the Subscriber within thirty (30) calendar days, or the end of the next billing cycle. 
c. ;hg;Subject to Section 4.3.b., and under normal conditions, as that term is defined in the initial Customer Service Standards, as adopted by Ordinance No. 2-94. Grantee must extend Cable Service to any person requesting it within seven (7) business days of the request, where Cable Service can be provided by activating or installing a standard drop, or in all other cases, within six (6) months of the request. 
d. ;hg;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantee shall install one (1) drop at no charge to every public school passed by the Cable System, within the Service Area, and to Casper City Hall. Grantee may charge for Cable Service delivered over that drop; however, the City and the schools may install facilities and equipment to transmit the signal to all rooms within a building, and shall not be required to pay any more for Cable Service than the Grantee charges for delivery to a single drop point to a residential Subscriber. 
4.4 ;hg; Educational and Governmental Use . 
a. ;hg;E G/PEG Channel Capacity . Grantee shall set aside one channel for educational and governmental ("EG") access use. The City may, by Council resolution, at any time during the term of this Franchise request that the Grantee provide this channel as a public, educational, and governmental ("PEG") access channel under the same terms and conditions as set forth herein for EG channel access. 
b. ;hg; Management . The City may designate any entity or entities to manage the channel. The City has the authority to determine scheduling of the use of the channel. 
c. ;hg; No Charge . The EG channel shall be available at no charge to users. 
d. ;hg; Grantee Not Responsible for Content . Grantee shall not be responsible for, nor shall the City hold the Grantee responsible for any claim for injury or damage arising from the programming carried on said channel set aside for EG use. It is intended by this Section that Grantee is extended at least the protection recognized by 47 U.S.C. § 558. 
e. ;hg; Other Programming . When the EG use channel is not being used to carry programming provided by other EG access users, the City or its designee, at their sole cost and expense, shall have the right to back-up EG programming with other noncommercial programming, consistent with promoting educational and governmental use of the channels. This paragraph shall not limit Grantee's rights under 47 U.S.C. § 531 (d). 
f. ;hg; General . Upon written request, Grantee shall wire and equip one room in addition to the Council Chambers in city hall for cable casting at no additional cost to City. 
g. ;hg; Production Support . 
1. ;hg;The Grantee shall produce and air for the City at no cost to City: 
i. ;hg;certain government and educational meetings and events for access purposes that are held in the City Council Chambers at City Hall; 
ii. ;hg;all City government meetings requested by the office of the City Manager, that are publicly held in City Hall rooms equipped to provide video production; 
iii. ;hg;certain EG Access, not to exceed two hours original air time per week; provided, however, in the event the City does not use the two hours on an on-going basis, the City and Grantee shall cooperate to provide City with additional time in a given week. 
iv. ;hg;Upon the acceptance of this Franchise Agreement by the Grantee, the Grantee agrees to upgrade the EG channel equipment to a level that is acceptable to the City, including, but not limited to upgrades in camera, lighting, and audio equipment, with updates thereafter occurring every five (5) years of this Franchise. In no event shall Grantee's obligation for any single upgrade or update exceed $20,000. 
2. ;hg;Grantee shall produce such access programming at no cost to the City on following terms:

SECTION 5. RATE REGULATION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. 
5.1 ;hg; Regulation of Rates and Charges . 
a. ;hg;The City may regulate Grantee's rates and charges to the fullest extent permitted by Federal law and regulations whether or not the rate or charge is specified in the Franchise. The city may adopt regulations governing the review of rates charged by the Grantee, consistent with Federal law. 
b. ;hg;Grantee shall file a schedule of its rates and charges with the City with its acceptance of this Franchise and shall file a revised schedule whenever any rate or charge is changed, without regard to whether the rate is subject to review or approval by the City. No rate regulated by the City may be changed without the prior approval of the City, except as Federal law otherwise provides. 
5.2 ;hg; Notice of Changes . 
At least thirty (30) calendar days prior to implementing any changes in rate levels or programming, Grantee shall provide the City written notice describing any such changes it plans to make and the proposed effective dates for the changes; or, in cases where the change in programming is not known to Grantee thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date the change is to be implemented, as soon as possible prior to implementing any change. At least thirty (30) calendar days prior to implementing any changes in rate level or programming, Grantee must provide each affected Subscriber notice, describing the changes it plans to make and the proposed effective dates for the changes. Subject to applicable law or regulation, any change made without the required notice shall be of no force or effect in determining the payments owed or the legal rights of the City or Subscribers, and Subscribers shall be entitled to rebates or credits of additional amounts collected without the required notice. The fact that Grantee made a change without the proper notice does not prevent Grantee from making that same change later with the proper notice. 
5.3 ;hg; Customer Service Standards . 
Grantee shall comply with and meet the Customer Service Standards during the term of this Franchise as provided and set forth in Exhibit "A" attached hereto, said exhibit being incorporated herein at this point as if fully set forth.

5.5 ;hg; Non-Discrimination . 
Except to the extent and for the time it is prohibited from doing so by Federal law, the City prohibits Grantee from discriminating among similarly situated Subscribers in the provision of any services, facilities, or equipment. Nothing shall prohibit Grantee from conducting temporary bona fide promotions, or from providing reasonable and not unduly discriminatory discounts to particular classes of customers as permitted by Federal law. 
SECTION 6. FRANCHISE FEES . 
6.1 ;hg; Franchise Fee, and Fee Renegotiation . 
As compensation for the use of valuable Public Ways, Grantee shall pay the City five percent (5%) of the Grantee's Gross Revenues except that the City may, from time-to-time authorize the Grantee by resolution, to pay a lower amount for a specified period. If the City so reduces the Franchise fee, the reduction shall be passed-through to Subscribers. This Franchise shall be read to prevent Grantee from avoiding the provisions of this Section by lease, contract, or other arrangement. 
The parties to this Franchise Agreement agree and understand that Congress, or the FCC may adopt, in the future, statutory provisions or regulations allowing governmental political subdivisions to charge and collect franchise fees for internet phone or other services being provided by cable service providers. In the event either Congress or the FCC, during the term of this Franchise Agreement, provides for, or allows the charging or assessment of franchise fees for provision of internet phone or other services, the parties hereto agree to negotiate, in good faith for the assessment of additional franchise fees by the City to the Grantee, and the parties further agree to amend this Franchise Agreement to reflect the additional franchise fee assessed thereby. 
6.2 ;hg; Payments Quarterly . 
The Franchise fee payment shall be due and payable quarterly: on or before June 1 for the first quarter, September 1 for the second quarter, December 1 for the third quarter, and March 1 for the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
6.3 ;hg; No Accord or Satisfaction . 
Acceptance of any Franchise fee payment shall not operate as an accord or satisfaction, or a waiver of any right under the Franchise or law, provided, however, unless the City shall commence any action on any payment within seven (7) years of the due date of the payment or City's right to recovery of such payment shall be deemed barred. 
6.4 ;hg; Reporting . 
Each Franchise fee payment shall be accompanied by a form satisfactory to the City reporting sources, the amount of gross revenues by source, and the recipient of the revenues, if an entity other than Grantee. Grantee shall annually provide a Franchise fee report showing total revenues received, by category. The forms must be prepared and signed by a certified public accountant, or attested to by the person principally responsible for the financial operations of the Grantee. 
6.5 ;hg; Right to Audit . 
The City shall have the right to audit records to ensure compliance with this Franchisee fee section, including records regarding revenues of the System, without regard to who holds that information, and without regard to who receives the revenue. The City shall give reasonable written notice of its intent to audit. It is the Grantee's responsibility to collect and to make available to the City, at the Grantee's local office records of all revenues on which a fee is required to be paid. If a City review of payments shows that the Grantee has underpaid the Franchise fee by more than 7%, for the year, the Grantee shall bear the cost of the audit as part of its cure of any underpayment. 
SECTION 7. LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, AND INSURANCE. 
7.1 Indemnity . 
The Grantee shall indemnify, defend, and save the City harmless from all loss or damages sustained by the City on account of any suit, judgment, execution, claim, or demand (including legal fees incurred) resulting from Grantee's installation, construction, operation, or maintenance of its System. The duty to indemnify and hold harmless shall include, but not be limited to, a duty to indemnify against losses or damages sustained as a result of Grantee's acts or omissions whether authorized or unauthorized under the Franchise (1) arising out of Grantee's use or attempt to use Public Ways; and, (2) arising out of any claim as a result of the Grantee's operation of the System; for Grantee's invasion of the right of privacy, libel, slander, copyright violation or patent infringement, except as provided in Section 4.4.d. The indemnity is conditioned on the following: the City must notify Grantee within ten (10) calendar days after the presentation of any claim or demand, either by suit or otherwise, made against the City on account of any act or omission by Grantee. The duty to indemnify shall include the duty to pay all necessary costs the City incurs in connection with defending against any action or claim, including its reasonable attorney's fees. Grantee's compliance with these indemnity provisions shall in no way limit any other remedies available to the City under this Franchise or at law or equity. 
7.2 Insurance . 
a. ;hg;The Grantee shall maintain the following insurance for its own coverage and for use in indemnification of the City: 
1. ;hg;Commercial general liability insurance in the minimum of $1,000,000 combined single limit for property damage or bodily injury or in such other amounts as are acceptable to the Grantee and the City and as provide substantially equivalent coverage. The City shall be designated as an additional insured. 
2. ;hg;Automobile liability in the same amounts as in Section 7.2.a.1. 
3. ;hg;Workers' Compensation and Employer's liability insurance in the amounts statutorily required. 
b. ;hg;With its acceptance of this Franchise, the Grantee shall furnish the City certificates of insurance, evidencing that Grantee has all the insurance required by this Section.

It is understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the amount of coverage reduced below required levels until thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the City Clerk of the City of Casper, Wyoming, by certified mail, of a written notice of intent to cancel or reduce the coverage. 
c. ;hg;The Grantee's compliance with these insurance requirements and recovery by the City of any amounts hereunder shall in no way waive or limit its duty to indemnify and hold harmless, or limit any other remedies available to the City under the Franchise, at law or equity. 
d. ;hg;Parties shall review the insurance types and amounts required above in the event risk exposure changes. 
7.3 ;hg; No Waiver of Immunities . 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Franchise shall be read to constitute or to require a waiver of any rights of the City under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. 
SECTION 8. MONITORING PERFORMANCE; EXERCISE OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY . 
8.1 Inspection of Books and Records . 
The City shall have access at all reasonable hours to all plans, contracts and engineering, accounting, financial, statistical, summary customer and service records, and other documents, as are necessary to the enforcement of City's rights or Grantee's obligations under this Franchise or applicable law. The documents requested shall be produced for inspection or copying by the City upon reasonable written notice and no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the request for production. If such requested documents are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied by the Grantee and moved, then Grantee or its Affiliate may request that the City inspect and copy them at Grantee's office. The City agrees to treat as confidential any information that would constitute proprietary or confidential information under Federal or State law. The Grantee is responsible for clearly and conspicuously stamping the word "confidential" on each page that contains confidential or proprietary information and, at the time it conveys the document to the City, it must explain that confidential information is being provided, identify the documents that are confidential and explain why the documents are alleged to be confidential. If the City believes it must release the documents in the course of enforcing the Franchise, it shall advise the Grantee in advance, so that Grantee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests. If the City receives a demand from any Person for disclosure of any information designated by Grantee as confidential, the City shall immediately advise the Grantee and provide Grantee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to such information. Until otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the City agrees that pursuant to the provisions of Wyoming Statutes 16-4-203(d)(v) and 16-4-203(e), it shall deny access to any of Grantee's documents containing confidential or proprietary information to any Person. This Section shall not govern the treatment of confidential documents produced in conjunction with any rate proceeding; protection of these documents shall be governed by lawful rate regulations the City may adopt from time to time. 
8.2 Records Maintained .

d. ;hg;Records of complaints, indicating date complaint received, nature of complaint and resolution of complaint, and date of resolution. 
The records shall be made available for City review and copying during normal business hours upon reasonable written request. The parties shall cooperate to amend requirements under this Section so that the City has access to information necessary to evaluate Grantee's compliance with the Franchise and so that Grantee may amend its forms as its services evolve. 
8.3 ;hg; Reports Prepared . 
The Grantee may be required by the City, upon reasonable written notice, to provide the following reports: 
a. ;hg;An annual report stating Subscriber totals for each category of service; the number of Subscribers added, and the number disconnecting.

4. ;hg;Any filing made at the FCC or any State or Federal agency regarding the Casper System, its proof-of-performance tests, or its RF signal lea-age tests. These documents shall be hand delivered or mailed to the City within thirty (30) calendar days of the City's written request. 
5. ;hg;Any request for protection under Bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy. The request shall be provided to the City on the same date it is filed. 
b. ;hg;Within five (5) business days of the date any of the following are received by the Grantee's, the following shall be provided to the City: any notice of deficiency, forfeiture, or other document issued by any State or Federal agency instituting any investigation of civil or criminal proceeding regarding the System, Grantee, or any Affiliate of Grantee or other cable operator of the System, to the extent the same may affect or bear on operations in Casper. 
8.5 ;hg; Obligation to Release . 
The Grantee shall take all reasonable steps required, if any, to provide the City with all information which must be provided or may be requested under this Franchise. Nothing in this Franchise shall be read to require Grantee to violate 47 U.S.C. § 551. 
8.6 ;hg; Maps and Plats . 
Grantee, upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice from the City Manager, or his or her designee, shall supply the City Utility Department and the City Engineer, trench and strand maps, showing the location of its existing poles, wires, cable lines, conduits and all other of its facilities within the City as the City may require for the design and planning of Public Ways and public works, public improvements and other public facilities and systems. Thereafter, the Grantee shall not move or alter the location of the portion of its System specifically located by the terms of this paragraph without compliance with the general notice requirements of this Franchise. Grantee, upon request of the City Manager or his/her designee, shall make available for review at the local office of the Grantee, a detailed System map. 
After completion of the installation of any segment of the System, and before the commencement of any new construction of any sort which would alter the location of Grantee's facilities in that segment, for which a permit is not otherwise required. Grantee shall file a map showing the proposed location of its new trench or strand, subject to the approval of the City manager or his designee as to location within the Public Ways.

The Grantee shall provide the information requested within thirty (30) calendar days of written request. Requests for extensions of time to respond shall not be unreasonably denied. 
8.9 ;hg; Testing .

b. ;hg;When, based on multiple Subscriber complaints, the City has questions concerning the reliability or technical quality of the Cable System, and when the Grantee can provide no satisfactory explanation for such complaints, the City may require the Grantee to perform tests and prepare a report showing: (1) the nature of the Subscriber complaint which precipitated the test; (2) the System component or area tested; (3) the equipment and procedures used; (4) any conclusions drawn from the tests; and, (5) other information pertinent to understanding the test. 
c. ;hg;If the City requires more than two (2) tests per calendar year under this Section, and any such additional test demonstrates that Grantee has substantially complied with the material provisions hereof, the cost of any additional test(s) shall be borne by the City. 
SECTION 9. PERFORMANCE GUARANTIES; REMEDIES; TERMINATION. 
9.1 ;hg; Liquidated Damages . 
Because Grantee's failure to comply with provisions of this Franchise will result in injury to the City, and because it will be difficult to estimate the extent of such injury, in certain cases the City and Grantee hereby agree to the following liquidated damages, which represent both parties' best estimate of the damages resulting from the specified injury. 
a. ;hg;For substantial violation of customer service standards: Fifty dollars ($50) per violation. 
b. ;hg;For all other material violations, including late payment of franchise fees under Section 4.4 for which actual damages may not be ascertainable: One hundred twenty-five dollars ($125) per day per violation, for each day a violation continues. 
The imposition of any liquidated damages shall be subject to Section 9.3, and any payment of liquidated damages shall not relieve the Grantee of its obligation to comply with the Franchise. 
9.2 ;hg; Termination . 
Except as otherwise provided herein, and subject to applicable law, the Franchise shall terminate on the expiration date hereof, unless lawfully extended, or at the City's option may be revoked, for the following reasons subject to the provisions of Section 9.3: 
a. ;hg;For a substantial violation of any material provision of the Franchise or any order, regulation or other determination of the City incorporated under this Franchise. 
b. ;hg;If Grantee is adjudicated bankrupt. 
c. ;hg;For any attempt to evade any material provision of the Franchise or to practice any fraud or deceit upon Cable System Subscribers or the City; or for any willful and material misrepresentation in obtaining this Franchise. 
9.3 ;hg; Procedures for Imposition of Penalties, Termination, and Forfeiture . 
a. ;hg;The City shall notify Grantee in writing of the alleged violation which may warrant imposition of liquidated damages under Section 9.1 or termination under Section 9.2 a. b. and c. which notice shall (1) describe the specific alleged violation; (2) direct Grantee to correct or to show cause why the alleged violation should not be corrected; and, (3) state the time for response which shall be no less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date Grantee is sent written notice. 
b. ;hg;Within the time designated, Grantee must (1) cure the violation or, in the event the violation cannot be completely cured within the time period specified, take reasonable steps to begin to cure, and submit a written response to City, identifying the specific steps taken; or, (2) contest the assertion of violation, describing all facts relevant to claim, supported by affidavits and documents. For a violation of 9.2.c. the City may require the surrender of the Franchise. 
c. ;hg;If Grantee contests the City's assertion of violation, or fails to completely cure the default, including by paying any damages owed, unless waived, the City shall schedule a hearing to review the default. The City shall cause to be served upon such Grantee at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of such hearing, a written notice of the City's intent to review; specify if termination is sought as a remedy; and, state the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published at least once, no later than seven (7) calendar days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The City shall hear any person interested therein, and shall specifically provide Grantee an opportunity to be heard, and shall determine whether or not any Grantee has complied, or submitted a reasonable plan for compliance. 
d. ;hg;If the City shall determine that such Grantee is not in compliance or has failed to submit a reasonable plan, then the City may take any actions it is permitted to take under this Franchise or applicable law. Such actions may be taken immediately upon completion of the hearing contemplated by this Section or at such time or after such additional proceedings as the City may specify. 
e. ;hg;Notwithstanding the above, before it can revoke the Franchise, the City must conduct a hearing in which the Grantee shall have at least thirty (30) days prior notice of such hearing, and the Grantee and the City shall be afforded a fair opportunity for full participation including, as permitted by Wyoming law, the right to introduce relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of officials, agents, employees or consultants of the other, to compel the testimony of other Persons and to question witnesses. The City and the Grantee shall attempt to select jointly a third party to conduct the hearings described above. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single hearing officer, each shall select one officer and the two officers so selected shall select a third officer. The hearing officer(s) shall determine whether or not the Grantee has complied or submitted a reasonable plan for compliance as required by Section 9, subject to Section 9.2.b. 
f. ;hg;If the Grantee is adversely affected by a decision of the City, it may file an appropriate action in any court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes of any action challenging a decision issued after the hearing required by Section 9.3.e., the parties stipulate that the record of the administrative hearing and the decisions of the hearing officer(s) and the City shall constitute the entire factual record. Grantee shall be entitled to such relief as the Court deems appropriate (1) if the Grantee demonstrates that the action of the City was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the stipulated record; or, (2) if the Court finds that the City's actions were not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this Section. 
9.4 ;hg; Continuity of Service; Disposition of System on Termination . 
a. ;hg;The Grantee has an obligation to provide for continuous, uninterrupted service to its Subscribers, as far as is possible, at all times. 
b. ;hg;Upon termination of this Franchise by passage of time or otherwise, Grantee and the City agree to cooperate in maintaining continuity of Cable Service to all Subscribers in the Service Area. To this end, upon the lawful termination of the Franchise, the City may require the Grantee to continue to operate and maintain the System after the Franchise is terminated for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months from the date of the final adjudication of any dispute holding that the Franchise has been lawfully terminated or canceled. This period is referred to as the "Transition Period." During the Transition Period, Grantee will continue to be bound by the terms of the Franchise and by applicable law, as if the Franchise remained in effect. 
c. ;hg;The City shall be entitled to injunctive relief: 
1. ;hg;After the passage of ninety-six (96) consecutive hours, if Grantee fails to provide Cable Service over a substantial portion of the Service Area, consistent with this Franchise, unless the City authorizes a longer interruption of service; or 
2. ;hg;Immediately, if the Grantee refuses to provide Cable Service over a substantial portion of the Service Area, consistent with this Franchise. 
In such injunctive relief, the City shall be entitled to have Grantee immediately resume operation of the Cable System as required by the Franchise, and to obtain such other injunctive relief which may be appropriate under the circumstances. As a matter of illustration and not of limitation, this Section is specifically subject to force majeure, as provided in Section 11. 
d. ;hg;Within twelve (12) months of the lawful termination of the Franchise, or the date upon which Grantee is last required to provide service, whichever is later, the Grantee shall remove its Cable System from the Public Ways, unless the City exercises its purchase option under Section 9.4.e. If Grantee or any of its assigns fails to remove the System within such time, that portion of the System found in the Public Ways on Subscriber property or other public property shall be deemed abandoned. The portion of the System that is abandoned shall become the property of the City. 
e. ;hg;Without limiting any rights of the City under other provisions of Federal, State or local law: 
1. ;hg;If renewal of the Franchise is denied, the City shall leave an option to acquire ownership of the Cable System or require Grantee to transfer ownership to another Person. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the Cable System valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the Franchise itself. 
2. ;hg;If the Franchise is revoked for cause or canceled, the City shall have an option to acquire ownership of the Cable System or require Grantee to transfer ownership to another Person. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be at an equitable price, as that term is used in Section 627(b) of the Cable Act. 
f. ;hg;Nothing in the Sections 9.4. a. b. c. and d. shall prevent the Grantee from selling its System to a third party during any Transition Period, or from selling unabandoned assets in place prior to their removal, provided that, any successor in interest shall be bound and must agree to be bound by all the obligations of the Grantee under this Section 9, including specifically its obligation to remove or abandon facilities as provided in Section 9.4.d. Every such sale or other assignment shall be subject to the review of the City and approval as provided by Section 617 of the Cable Act. 
9.5 ;hg; Notification of Options . 
The City shall notify the Grantee of its intent to exercise the option to buy upon revocation, termination for cause, or cancellation within six (6) months of the final determination of the validity of the City's decision to terminate. The City and Grantee shall enter into good faith negotiations promptly to establish price in accordance with Section 9.4 and terms and conditions which reflect usual industry practices. 
SECTION 10. TRANSFER. 
10.1 ;hg; No Transfer Without Consent . 
The Franchise may not be assigned or transferred, in whole or part, or leased or sublet, mortgaged or pledged in trust by any means, without the City's prior consent. Without limitation, a transfer of the Franchise itself, or of the Cable System constitutes a transfer within the meaning of this Section. A change of control or ownership of Grantee or an affiliate that is involved in the operation of the System also shall be considered a transfer of the Franchise. The term "control" includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. Grantee and the proposed transferee must cooperate in the City's investigation of the transfer and each is required to provide pertinent documents and respond to reasonable requests for information. In reviewing a transfer request, the City may examine the financial, technical, and legal qualifications of the transferee; whether the transferee agrees to accept and be bound by each and every term of the Franchise; whether the transferee agrees to accept to be bound by related amendments, ordinances, and resolutions then lawfully in effect; whether the transferee agrees to assume all liability and responsibility for acts of omissions of Grantee, known and unknown, to correct any defects in performance and to be held responsible for acts and omissions of the Grantee, as if they were its own, for all purposes, including renewal, transfer or revocation of the franchise; whether the transferee agrees that the transfer will not allow it to exercise any rights which could not have been exercised by the transferor, had it continued to hold the Franchise; and any other matter which the City is legally entitled or required to consider. Subject to applicable law, the City may grant, deny, or establish conditions on transfer, as appropriate hereunder, to protect its interests in the Franchise and the public interest as it may then appear, but may not withhold its consent to a transfer unreasonably. The Grantee and the transferee shall have an obligation to provide all relevant information the City reasonably requests in order to make this determination. 
10.2 ;hg; Securing Debt . 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of the System to secure an indebtedness may be made without the City's prior consent, except that no such arrangements may be made which would in any respect under any condition prevent Grantee or any successor from complying with all its obligations under the Franchise or applicable law, nor may any such arrangement permit a third party to succeed to the interest of Grantee without the prior consent of the City. 
10.3 Effect of Unlawful Transfer . 
Any transfer, assignment, or change of control made in violation of this Section shall make the Franchise subject to cancellation. 
10.4 Timetable for Consideration . 
Any request for a transfer shall be deemed granted unless the City acts upon the request within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date the transferee and transferor have submitted the information which they may be required to submit in connection with the transfer. The timetable may be extended with the consent of the City and either the Grantee or transferee. 
SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
11.1 ;hg; Effect of Preemption; Federal and State Law . 
Grantee and City must comply with all applicable provisions of Federal and State law. If the City's ability to enforce any Franchise provision is preempted, then the provision shall be deemed preempted but only to the extent and for the period the preemption is required by law. If, as a result of a change in law or otherwise, the provision would again be enforceable, it shall be enforceable without the requirement of further action on the City's part. 
11.2 ;hg; Severability . 
If any Section, Subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Franchise is for any reason held illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any State or Federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion hereof. 
11.3 ;hg; Acts of God .

(iii) ;hg;The "appointment window" alternatives for installations, service calls, and other installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours. (The operator may schedule service calls and other installation activities outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of the customer.)

    WHEREAS, under Wyoming Statutes Section 15-1-103(a)(xxxiii), a city may grant franchises for such terms as the governing body deems property to any utility company, provided no franchise may be entered into with any person in which that person is given an exclusive right for any purpose whatsoever; and,

Mountain West Telephone, 123 West 1st Street, Suite C-95, Casper, Wyoming 82601 ("Franchisee"). Throughout this document, the City and Franchisee may be individually referred to as a "party" or collectively referred to as the "parties;" and, 
    WHEREAS, on November 14, 2012, the parties have negotiated this mutually acceptable Agreement for this franchise. 
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CITY OF CASPER, WYOMING: 
SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS AND TERMS 
A.  "Commission" means the Wyoming Public Service Commission or its successor. 
B.  "Customer" means a person, business or other entity that purchases a service from the Franchisee and receives all or part of the service within the City boundary. 
C.  "Gross Revenue" means all revenue, cash or otherwise, of the Franchisee for the provision of local telecommunication services to any location inside the City limits, without regard to where the service is billed or paid. Gross Revenues shall not include: 
1.  Any sales, excise or other taxes which are imposed directly on any telecommunications service subscriber by any governmental unit or agency and which are collected by the Franchisee on behalf of such governmental unit or agency. 
2.  Proceeds from the sale of bonds, mortgages, or other evidence of indebtedness, securities or stocks. 
3.  Sales at wholesale by Franchisee to another utility when the utility purchasing such services is not the ultimate consumer, is itself a franchisee of the City, and is paying a franchise fee to the City on the revenue derived from the use of Franchisee's telecommunication system. 
4.  Any revenues reported by the Franchisee but which in fact constitute bad debt; except that "Gross Revenues" shall include all recoveries of such bad debt, by the Franchisee directly or by any person on the Franchisee's behalf. Provided that, in order to take advantage of this Section, the Franchisee must maintain books and records in a form so that bad debt and recoveries can be easily and fully identified. 
5.  Installation, setup, consulting, lease, and rental charges. 
6.  Sale of hardware or equipment. 
D.  "Local loop" means the "last mile" facilities (either wired facilities or the wireless equivalent) utilized for transmission between a central office and the end user premises in a telephone network, a node and the end user premises in a cable network, or the analogous portion of the facilities of other providers of telephone service or broadband connections. 
E.  "Telecommunications" means the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. 
F.  "Local telecommunication services" means the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used but including only that portion of the service that includes transmission between the Customer Premises and the Franchisee's designated Point-of-Presence. 
SECTION 2. PURPOSE. 
    The City hereby grants to Franchisee, a corporation authorized to do business in the State of Wyoming, its successors and assigns, a nonexclusive right to construct, maintain and operate a telecommunications service system. The telecommunications system may be placed in, under, upon, over, across and along the streets, alleys, bridges and public places for the furnishing, transmission, distribution and sale of telecommunications services for the benefit of the inhabitants of the City, and persons and corporations within and beyond the limits of the City, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to making of payments hereinafter specified. 
SECTION 3. USE OF STREETS AND PUBLIC GROUNDS/RESTORATION OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY. 
3.1  GENERAL CONDITIONS ON USE. 
A.  The Franchisee may not endanger nor unreasonably interfere with the lives or property of persons; unreasonably interfere with property of the City or any public utility; or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct use of the Public Ways. The Franchise does not establish priority for use of Public Ways over holders of other permits or franchises; it grants no vested interest in occupying any particular position in the Public Ways. The City shall control distribution of space in the Public Ways, but may not exercise that authority unreasonably. No location of any pole, utility box, or wire-holding structure shall give rise to a vested interest in City property or Public Ways and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the Franchisee whenever the City reasonably determines that the public interest will be enhanced thereby. 
B.  The telecommunications system shall be installed in Public Ways and other places within the limits of the City, subject to the inspection of and in close cooperation and coordination with the City Manager or his/her designee. All cable placed under streets, roads and other Public Ways crossed by vehicular traffic shall be placed in conduit. 
C.  Without obtaining the prior written approval of the City, the Franchisee shall not install or erect its telecommunications system in or on public property, rights-of-way or in any privately-owned area within the City that has not yet become a Public Way, even if it is designated or delineated as a proposed Public Way on any subdivision plat submitted for approval by the City, except insofar as the telecommunications system may be installed or erected on public utility facilities then existing. 
D.  The Franchisee shall expeditiously carry out all of its operations during the course of any construction, repairs or maintenance operations on Public Ways of the City. 
E.  If the Franchisee performs any excavation or other construction in any portion of any Public Way, Franchisee shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the public using such Public Ways from harm including erecting proper barriers and warning facilities. All barriers and related signs shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. Paved streets shall be bored or drilled when they are crossed beneath the ground by Franchisee's telecommunications system so that the City's paved streets will not be unnecessarily damaged. The City Manager or his/her designee, in his/her sole discretion, may allow other construction methods when he/she finds that drilling or boring is unreasonable and will not provide a sufficient public benefit for the cost. All excavation shall be performed to create the least inconvenience to the public, and in accordance with permits and manuals issued by the City. The City shall have the right, but not the responsibility to supervise all excavation. 
F.  Franchisee shall bury or suspend each of its service lines from its main trunk lines to individual customers. In no event shall it allow its cable to lie upon the ground except as may be necessary during actual construction or repair to the service line, and in no event shall it be allowed to remain upon the ground for more than sixty (60) calendar days, provided that Franchisee is not required to bury its cable between October 15 and April 15 where the weather prevents it. Subject to the foregoing, in the event the Franchisee fails to bury any cable within sixty (60) calendar days, then the City shall give the Franchisee a written objection to the delay. If Franchisee fails to perform the work within ten (10) business days after receipt of the notice, the City may have the cable buried. The Franchisee shall compensate the City for expenses incurred in connection with this work. 
3.2  NO HINDRANCE TO PUBLIC WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS. 
A.  Franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, install, construct, operate, and maintain its telecommunications system so that it does not interfere with or hinder the City's installation, construction, maintenance, or operation of any public works, public improvements, or other publicly-owned facilities or systems. Whether the Franchisee's installation, construction, operation, or maintenance of its telecommunications system is an interference or hindrance is at the reasonable discretion of the City Manager or his/her designee. 
B.  The Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove its telecommunications system as requested by the City for reasons of traffic conditions, public health and safety, and protection of property, construction, repair, maintenance or relocation of any Public Way, grade change, or construction, relocation, installation or maintenance of any public works, public improvements, or other publicly-owned facilities or systems. If, after fifteen (15) business days from the deadline provided in the written notice, Franchisee fails to remove or relocate its telecommunications system as required by the City, the City may remove or relocate Franchisee's telecommunications system, and Franchisee shall compensate the City for all expenses incurred thereby. 
C.  Franchisee, at all times, will keep a map in the office of Franchisee and in the City Engineer's Office of the City showing the size and approximate location of its cables and other supporting infrastructure laid in said telecommunications system in the City. The map will be replaced each year, upon request by the City, with a revised map showing the new construction for the previous calendar year. The Franchisee shall provide the City annually GIS Data on a DVD or other acceptable electronic storage form with files in ArcView format, or other technology agreed upon by the City and Franchisee, at no cost to the City. Except for information that is protected under the Wyoming Public Records Act, Wyoming Statute Sections 16-4-201 et seq., upon request by Franchisee the City shall provide Franchisee annually a Municipality GIS Data DVD with electronic files in ArcView format, or other technology agreed upon by the City and Franchisee, at no cost to Franchisee. The electronic files provided Franchisee by the City shall include (if and to the extent available) the following features and attributes: Parcels, Structures, Boundaries, Utilities, Transportation, Natural Features, Community Development Planning, Hazards, Parks & Recreation, Public Safety, Topography and Imagery. 
3.3  AERIAL AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION. With regard to all areas of new construction or line extension, where the distribution facilities of public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are located underground, the Franchisee likewise shall locate its telecommunications system underground. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Franchisee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as Subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related equipment. For purposes of this Section, "undergrounding" shall include a partial underground system. Amplifiers on the telecommunications system must be underground wherever feasible, but may be in appropriate housings upon the surface of the ground when it is commercially impractical to place them underground. 
3.4  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. The construction, installation, operation, and maintenance of the telecommunications system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. In addition to requirements of local law and conditions established by the utilities whose facilities are used by the telecommunications system, all such work shall be performed in accordance with best engineering practices, in accordance with at least the following safety, construction, and technical specifications and codes and standards, as they may now exist or be amended or adopted hereafter: 
A.  National Electrical Code; 
B.  National Electrical Safety Code (NESC); 
C.  Obstruction Marking and Lighting, AC 70/7460; Federal Aviation Administration; 
D.  All Federal, State, and Municipal Construction Requirements, including FCC Rules and Regulations; and, 
E.  Local building and zoning codes, and all land use restrictions and local safety codes. 
The City may to the extent consistent with its policing powers from time to time adopt additional standards of general applicability as appropriate to assure work is performed in a safe and workmanlike manner. 
3.5  SUBCONTRACTORS. All contractors or subcontractors shall be properly licensed, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with respect to its work as Franchisee would have under this Franchise and applicable laws if the work were performed by Franchisee. Franchisee shall be responsible for ensuring that the work of contractors and subcontractors is performed consistent with the Franchise and applicable law, and that all contractors and subcontractors are familiar with their responsibilities. 
3.6  POLES. The City may, upon reasonable notice to Franchisee and without contact charges or rental therefor, attach its fire alarm, police signal wires, traffic control systems, signs, or communication systems for the City's own use, to the poles of Franchisee, but at its own risk and expense and only in accordance with the National Electric Safety Code (NESC) and accepted electric utility industry standards. If there is not sufficient space available thereon for said purposes, Franchisee's structures may be changed, altered, or rearranged at City's expense so as to provide proper clearance for such wires or appurtenant facilities. Such facilities shall be subject to interference by Franchisee only when and to the extent necessary for the proper construction, maintenance, operation or repair of Franchisee's facilities. 
SECTION 4. SYSTEM SERVICES. 
4.1  CITY INTERNET CONNECTION. Telecommunication services will be offered to the City to support its general government operations. 
A.  MONTHLY CHARGE. City will have the option to purchase telecommunication services from Franchisee at a rate of $10 per month for each megabyte per second (MB) of download connectivity. Each purchased MB of download connectivity will be matched with an equivalent amount of upload connectivity at no additional charge. 
B.  NONRECURRING CHARGES. City will not be charged for any connection, design, excavation, cable extension, or similar non-recurring fee that is associated with the installation of any new service connection, provided that the service connection is located within 300 feet of a slack loop/splice point or other suitable connection point, and provided that the associated cable extension crosses no more than one street centerline. The cost to purchase or lease any on premises equipment beyond the demarcation point within the City facilities that is required to receive the telecommunication services, and which is not normally included in the installation services shall be bourne by the City. 
For the purposes of this paragraph, distance shall be calculated as the length of cable required to extend the connection from the nearest suitable connection point at the City's facility to the nearest suitable connection point of the Franchisee's local loop infrastructure. For connections that are further than 300 feet distant or cross more than one street centerline from the Franchisee's local loop infrastructure, the City shall pay non-recurring connection fees as they are normally calculated by the Franchisee for its customers minus the normally calculated value of a non-recurring connection fee for a facility that is exactly 300 feet distant from the Franchisee's existing local loop infrastructure which shall include the cost of crossing one street centerline. 
C.  CHANGES IN SERVICE. The City shall not pay any service cancellation charges. City may opt to cancel, reduce, or enhance its connectivity to any existing City facility. Any change that does not require additional excavation will be made no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of notice to proceed from City to the Franchisee. Any change that requires additional excavation will be made no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of notice to proceed from the City, including any relevant permits to the Franchisee. If any service is canceled or reduced to less than 10 MB connection speed before the termination of this franchise agreement, within 36 months of the initial installation of service at that location, and has incurred less than $5,500 in service charges for the telecommunications services provided by the Franchisee related to that installation, then the City shall pay to Franchisee the difference in total amount of non-recurring charges that were waived in paragraph "B" of this section and the total amount of charges incurred from services received associated with that installation. 
D.  None of the provisions of this section shall be construed to withstand any contradictory unexpired and pre-existing contracts between the City and the Franchisee. 
4.2  PUBLIC USE SERVICES. 
    PUBLIC WIRELESS HOTSPOT. The Franchisee will provide a public wireless Wi-Fi hotspot. The hotspot will allow individuals with a wireless device to connect wirelessly to the internet. 
A.  INSTALLATION OF ANTENNAS. Antennas shall be located either on the Franchisee's private property or within the City's right-of-way.

The city will not unreasonably deny access to an optimal antenna location, provided that said antennas will be used solely and exclusively for the support of the free wireless hotspot, except as provided for in paragraph "F" of this section. City will not charge Franchisee for the use of these antenna locations. 
B.  ANTENNA SPECIFICATIONS. Antennas and radio equipment that will be utilized shall be as unobtrusive in design / size as possible. Placement of antennas / radio equipment will be made in such a way as to conceal as best possible the access point and antennas. Antennas shall be as compact as practical. A map showing the location of said antennas will be provided when initial installation is complete and on an annual basis showing any updates or changes to location for the term of this agreement. 
C.  WELCOME PAGE SPECIFICATIONS. The welcome or landing page for the WiFi service shall be a standard Mountain West landing page without any City identification. It will include the Terms of Service, liability notices, and user registration with a valid email address and password.

F.  CHARGES. The wireless hotspot system shall be installed, operated, and maintained by the Franchisee at no charge to the City. The wireless hotspot services shall be available at no charge to any member of the public who utilizes the free hotspot service. Franchisee may allow members of the public to voluntarily upgrade to faster connection speeds above the speeds described in paragraph "d" of this section, and franchisee may charge for such enhanced services. 
G.  ACCEPTABLE USE OF FREE WIFI. The use of the free public WiFi service is subject to the terms and conditions of Franchisee's Acceptable Use policy, including any updates or amendments made thereto throughout the term of the agreement. Continuous usage as defined by a continuous connection of service for more than 6 hours shall not be allowed. 
1.  Free Wireless access through the hotspot is not intended to replace subscription internet access for business customers. If a for-profit or non-profit company operates from an address that is within range of the wireless hotspot, then the Franchisee may regulate or eliminate free hotspot wireless access for devices that are owned or operated by that company for its general operations. 
H.  GUARANTEE OF SERVICE/INTERFERENCE. The free public WiFi system is not guaranteed to work with all devices and the WiFi signal may be subject to interference from other technology in use in the designated Service Area. 
I.  TERM. The hotspot will be operational within six months of the acceptance of this agreement and it will remain operational throughout the term of this agreement. 
SECTION 5. TERM. 
    The right and authority herein granted shall continue for a period of eight (8) years from and after the date of final passage of this Agreement, subject to the City's right to renegotiate the franchise fee as described in Section 7.d. below.

Franchisee shall pay to the City in quarterly payments for each year of the Agreement's duration an amount equal to the franchise fee collected by Franchisee hereunder. Payment shall be made on or before June 1 for the period of January 1 through March 31 of said year, on or before September 1 for the period of April 1 through June 30 of said year, on or before December 1 for the period of July 1 through September 30 of said year, and on or before March 1 for the period of October 1 through December 31 of the preceding year. 
B.  Such payment shall be in lieu of any and all other fees, charges, licenses, taxes or assessments which the City may impose for the rights and privileges herein granted or for the telecommunications system, except that such payment shall not be in lieu of any required permit fees (which Franchisee shall pay before the commencement of the work on the telecommunications system covered by the permit fees). In the event the City imposes any fee, charge, license, tax or assessment other than any required permit fees, the payment to be made in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be refunded in an amount equal to the annual burden of such fee, charge, license, tax or assessment imposed upon the Franchisee.

Such payment shall be in addition to taxes of general applicability owed to the Grantor by the Grantee that are not included as franchise fees under federal law. Franchise fees may be passed through to Subscribers as a line item on Subscriber bills or otherwise as Grantee chooses, consistent with federal law. 
9.2  Payment of Fee . Payment of the fee due the Grantor shall be made on a quarterly basis, within forty-five (45) days of the close of each calendar quarter.

In the event of a dispute, the Grantor, if it so requests, shall be furnished a verified statement of said payment, reflecting the Gross Revenues and the applicable charges.

10.1  Franchise Transfer . The Franchise granted hereunder shall not be assigned, other than by operation of law or to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without the prior consent of the Grantor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or Cable System to secure indebtedness. If the Grantor has not taken action on the Grantee's request for transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving such request, consent by the Grantor shall be deemed given.

11.4  Inspection of Records . Grantee shall permit any duly authorized representative of the Grantor, upon receipt of advance written notice, to examine during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis any and all of Grantee's records maintained by Grantee as is reasonably necessary to ensure Grantee's compliance with the Franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the subsection of the Franchise that is under review so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the Grantor. The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records for Franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years, except for: (1) books and records showing the calculation of Gross Revenues and payment of Franchise Fees, which shall be kept for ten (10) years; and (2) service complaints, which shall be kept for one (1) year as specified above. The Grantee shall not be required to provide Subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act. The Grantor agrees to treat as confidential any books, records or maps that constitute proprietary or confidential information to the extent Grantee make the Grantor aware of such confidentiality. If the Grantor believes it must release any such confidential books or records in the course of enforcing this Franchise, or for any other reason, it shall advise Grantee in advance so that Grantee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests. Until otherwise ordered by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, the Grantor agrees that, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, it shall deny access to any of Grantee's books and records marked confidential, as set forth above, to any Person. 
SECTION 12 . 
Education and Government (EG) Access 
12.1  Education and Government Access . Grantee shall provide one (1) channel on the Cable System for use by the Grantor's non-commercial, video programming for education and government ("EG") access programming. The EG channel may be placed on any tier of service available to Subscribers. The Grantor shall utilize the EG channel as follows: the Grantor shall, at a minimum, cablecast its regular Council meetings on the channel. 
12.2  Management and Availability . The City may designate any entity or entities to manage the channel. The City has the authority to determine scheduling of the use of the channel. The EG Channel shall be available to all Subscribers without additional costs or equipment, provided that Grantee may require use of equipment, such as converters, that is required of all Subscribers generally. 
12.3  Grantee Not Responsible for Content . Grantee shall not be responsible for, nor shall the Grantor hold the Grantee responsible for any claim for injury or damage arising from the programming carried on the EG channel. It is intended by this Section that Grantee is extended at least the protection recognized by 47 U.S.C. § 558. 
12.4  Return of Channel to Grantor . In the event the programming levels set forth herein are not maintained or if the Grantor does not adequately use the channel, Grantee reserves the right to have the channel returned to the Grantee for the Grantee's use. Grantee shall provide Grantor with sixty (60) days' prior written notice informing Grantor when programming levels set forth herein are not being maintained. Grantee reserves the right to utilize the EG channel only after Grantor has been notified and Grantor has not maintained programming levels set forth herein within sixty (60) days from receipt of said notice. In the event the Grantee exercises its right to again utilize said EG channel after the sixty (60) day period elapses, the Grantee shall notify its customers of Grantee's intention to utilize the EG channel by providing customers with a thirty (30) day prior written notice. In addition, the Grantee may use the designated channel during those hours that the Grantor or other governmental, public or educational entity is not using the channel. 
12.5  Capital Support for Education and Government Access Channel . Grantee shall provide an EG capital grant in the amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00), payable to the Grantor within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date. Grantor and Grantee acknowledge that pursuant to Federal Law [47 U.S.C. §§ 542(g)(2)(C)] EG funds are only to be used for EG capital equipment costs and not for operational costs. EG capital support shall be for the exclusive use of the Grantor within the Service Area and shall not be used for purposes other than as described under Section 12.5 herein. The Grantor shall be responsible for installing, operating, maintaining and replacing the equipment purchased as necessary. The Grantee shall be entitled to recover such capital costs from subscribers as allowed by federal law. Five (5) years from the Effective Date of this Franchise, the Grantor may request in writing an additional EG capital grant in an amount up to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) which shall be payable to the Grantor within sixty (60) days of a written request. Such request shall be accompanied by a report showing how the previous capital EG grant was used, and a description of the future EG capital needs that will be paid by the EG grant. Grantor and Grantee shall discuss the requested EG capital request, which shall not be unreasonably denied by Grantee. 
12.6  EG Competitive Neutrality . If any new or renewed Cable System or Video Service agreement, as defined in Section 14.4.1, contains obligations that are lesser in amount than the obligations imposed in this Section 12, Grantee's aggregate obligations under Section 12 shall be reduced to an equivalent amount. To the extent such a reduction is not sufficient to make the total obligations of this Franchise equivalent to the new or renewed franchise, Grantee may deduct from future franchise fee payments an amount sufficient to make the obligations of this Franchise equivalent to the new or renewed franchise. 
SECTION 13 . 
Enforcement or Revocation 
13.1  Informal Resolution . In all cases where the Grantor believes that the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the Franchise, the Grantor, via the City Manager or his/her designee, shall first informally discuss the matter with Grantee and seek mutual resolution of the problem. 
13.2  Notice of Default . If the Grantee engages in a pattern of noncompliance, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the Franchise where informal discussions do not lead to mutually acceptable resolution of the issue, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged pattern of noncompliance (the "Default Notice"). The Default Notice shall contain a statement specifically describing the default and the identification and contact information of any person providing information that serves as the basis for the default allegation. 
13.3  Grantee's Right to Cure or Respond . The Grantee shall have ninety (90) days from receipt of the Default Notice to (i) respond to the Grantor, contesting the assertion of default, or (ii) to cure such default, or (iii) if, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the ninety (90) day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the Grantor of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. During this time the Grantor shall make reasonable efforts to make any employee of Grantor available for interview by Grantee, and shall provide information that serves as the basis for default allegation available to Grantee. 
13.4  Enforcement . Subject to applicable local, state, and federal law, in the event the Grantor, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of the Franchise, the Grantor may: 
A.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; or 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or 
C.  In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the Franchise, seek to revoke the Franchise itself in accordance with subsection 13.5 below. 
D.  Upon revocation of the Franchise, Grantor may require Grantee to remove the Cable System from the Streets of the Grantor. 
13.5  Revocation Procedure . 
A.  If the Grantee fails to respond to the Default Notice received from the Grantor, or if the default is not remedied within the cure period set forth above, the Grantor may seek to revoke the Franchise as outlined in this subsection. 
B.  Prior to holding a public hearing on whether or not to revoke the Franchise, the Grantor shall give sixty (60) days' written notice to the Grantee. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the default. During those sixty (60) days the Grantee may either object in writing and state its reasons for such objection, and provide any explanation or to cure the alleged default. 
C.  If the Grantor has not received a satisfactory response from Grantee, it may then seek to revoke the Franchise at a public hearing. The Grantee shall be given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of such public hearing, specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke the Franchise. 
D.  At the hearing, the Council shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, present evidence and question witnesses, after which it shall determine whether or not the Franchise shall be revoked. The public hearing shall be on the record and a written transcript or recorded video of the proceeding shall be made available to the Grantee within thirty (30) business days at Grantee's sole cost and expense. The decision of the Council shall be made in writing and shall be delivered to the Grantee. The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the Council de novo.

SECTION 14 . 
Miscellaneous Provisions 
14.1  Force Majeure . The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes, but is not limited to, severe or unusual weather conditions, fire, flood, or other acts of God; strikes, work delays caused by failure of utility providers to service, maintain or monitor their utility poles to which Grantee's Cable System is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. 
14.2  Minor Violations . Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the Grantor's intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the Franchise for violations of the Franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the Subscribers within the Service Area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee which outweighs the benefit to be derived by the Grantor and/or Subscribers. 
14.3  Action of Parties . In any action by the Grantor or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
14.4  Level Playing Field . Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantor may be required by federal law, and reserves the right, to grant one or more additional franchises to provide Cable Service within the Service Area. If any other provider of cable services or video services (without regard to the technology used to deliver such services) is lawfully authorized to use the Streets to provide such services, and if the material obligations applicable to Grantee are more burdensome or less favorable than those imposed on any such competing provider, then upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice to Grantor, Grantee shall have the right and may choose, to the extent consistent with applicable federal and state laws and orders and rules adopted pursuant thereto: 
A)  to modify this Franchise as Grantee and Grantor mutually determine is reasonably necessary to ensure that the material obligations applicable to Grantee are not more burdensome or less favorable than those imposed on any such competing provider; or 
B)  to deem this Franchise expired thirty-six (36) months from the date of the above written notice; or 
C)  to terminate this Franchise and take in its place substantially the same franchise agreement of a competing provider of Cable Services or video services authorized by Grantor. 
14.4.1  Material Obligations . Grantor and Grantee agree that any undertakings that relate to the renewal of the Franchise shall be subject to the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546) or any such successor statute. Nothing in this Franchise shall impair the right of Grantor or Grantee to seek other remedies available under law. For purposes of this section, "material obligations" shall include: underground construction; service to public buildings; customer service; franchise fee; education and government (EG) access, including any capital support; and records retention and inspection thereof. 
14.4.2  Video Service . For the purpose of this Section 14.4, "Video Service" shall mean the provision of multichannel video programming generally considered comparable to video programming delivered by a television broadcast station, cable service or other digital television service, whether provided as part of a tier, on demand or on a per-channel basis, without regard to the technology used to deliver the video service, including, without limitation, Internet protocol technology or any successor technology. The term includes, without limitation: Cable Service and Video Service delivered by a community antenna television system. The term does not include: any video content provided solely as part of, and through a service offered by or over a network which does not utilize facilities located in Grantor's Public Ways, such as: (i) a service which enables users to access content, information, electronic mail or services that are offered via the public Internet, (ii) direct broadcast satellite service, and (iii) any wireless multichannel video programming provided by a commercial mobile service provider. 
14.5  Notices . Unless otherwise provided by federal, state or local law, all notices, reports or demands pursuant to this Franchise shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be sufficiently given upon delivery to a Person at the address set forth below, or by U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested, nationally or internationally recognized courier service such as Federal Express. Grantee shall provide thirty (30) days' written notice of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions using any reasonable written means.

    WHEREAS, under Wyoming Statute § 15-1-103(a)(xxxiii), a city may grant franchises for such terms as the governing body deems proper to any utility company, provided no franchise may be entered into with any person in which that person is given an exclusive right for any purpose whatsoever; and, 
    WHEREAS, CenturyLink is a utility company that desires a franchise from the City; and, 
    WHEREAS, the City has determined that it is in the public interest to grant a franchise to CenturyLink under the terms and conditions contained herein.

This Franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the System required by, and to fulfill the obligations set forth in, the provisions of this Franchise. 
B.  Nothing in this Franchise shall be deemed to waive the lawful requirements of any generally applicable City ordinance existing as of the effective date of this Franchise. 
C.  This Franchise shall not be interpreted to prevent the City from imposing additional lawful conditions, including additional compensation conditions for use of Public ways, should CenturyLink provide services other than a telecommunication system (for example, a cable system for purposes of providing a cable service). 
D.  This Franchise is intended to convey limited rights and interests in Public Ways as set forth in Wyoming Statute § 15-1-103(a)(xxxiiii) and its subsections. It is not a warranty of title or interest in any Public Way; it does not provide CenturyLink with any interest in any particular location within the Public Way; and it does not confer rights other than as expressly provided in the grant hereof. 
SECTION 2. Acceptance by CenturyLink . This ordinance shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City, pursuant to Wyoming Statute § 15-1-116, and shall become effective on the day following its publication. Within sixty (60) days after the passage of this Ordinance by the City, CenturyLink shall file a signed copy thereof with the City Clerk, otherwise the Ordinance and the rights, privileges and authority granted herein shall be null and void. 
SECTION 3. Term . The Term of this Franchise is ten (10) years commencing on the date of Acceptance by CenturyLink as set forth in Section 2, above, and then from year-to-year until a party gives the other party at least ninety (90) days' notice in writing and in advance of expiration of the initial term or any subsequent term stating an intent to terminate the agreement at the end of such existing term. 
SECTION 4. Franchise Fee . 
A.  Payments and Reports . 
1.  Quarterly Payments . From and after the date of CenturyLink's Acceptance of this Ordinance and until its expiration, CenturyLink will pay the City five percent (5%) of CenturyLink's local exchange access service Gross Revenue (as defined in Appendix A hereto).

Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days after those dates. 
2.  No Accord and Satisfaction . No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord and satisfaction by the City that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall any acceptance of payments be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable or for the performance of any other obligation of CenturyLink. 
B.  Franchise Termination . If this Franchise terminates for any reason, and CenturyLink ceases operations in the City or is not in the negotiation with the City of a replacement Franchise, CenturyLink shall file with the City within 90 calendar days of the date of termination, a financial statement, certified by an independent certified public accountant, showing the Gross Revenues received by CenturyLink since the end of the previous fiscal year. 
C.  Late Payments . If any payment due quarterly is not received within 30 days from the end of the calendar quarter, CenturyLink shall pay interest on the amount due (at the prime rate as listed in the Wall Street Journal on the date the payment was due), compounded daily, calculated from the date that payment was originally due until the date the City receives the payment. 
D.  Under Payments . If a net franchise underpayment is discovered as a result of an audit, CenturyLink shall pay interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, compounded quarterly, calculated from the date each portion of the underpayment was originally due until the date CenturyLink remits the underpayment to the City. 
SECTION 5. Records Inspection . No more frequently that once every two years, the City shall have the right to audit records to ensure compliance with this Franchise.

D.  No vicious or dangerous animal shall be unconfined on its owner's premises. A vicious or dangerous animal is "unconfined" as the term is used in this section if the animal is not securely confined indoors or confined in a securely enclosed and locked pen, or upon the premises of the owner. Any pen or run area shall be suitable to confine the animal and to prevent the entry of young children or persons other than the owner of the animal. The pen or run area must have all sides at least six feet high and a secure top. No sides of the pen or run can be part of the perimeter property fence. If the pen or run structure has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be imbedded into the ground no less than one foot.

F.  The owner of a vicious or dangerous animal shall notify MAS or the police department immediately of the animal's escape or release, that the animal is loose, unconfined, has attacked another animal or human being, has died or has been sold or given away or relocated in any manner. If the vicious animal has been sold or given away, or if the current owner moves, within the jurisdiction of MAS, the owner or keeper shall provide MAS with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner or the new address of the current owner. Upon sale or conveyance, the new owner will be obligated to comply with the requirements of this section, and the current owner shall be required to comply with the requirements of this section at any subsequent location or residence. 
G.  If an animal protection officer has probable cause to believe that a vicious or dangerous animal is being kept, harbored or cared for, in violation of this chapter, the animal protection control officer may seize and impound the animal if it is on property not of the owner or seek a court order to impound the animal until a hearing on the matter may be held or until the owners have built or bought an enclosure to protect the public as provided in this chapter and/or otherwise addressed the court's order. 
H.  If a purported vicious or dangerous animal is impounded, the animal shall be held pending trial and disposition of the case and thereafter pursuant to court order, unless the court is convinced that the public will be protected by specified actions ordered by the court or agreed upon by the court and owners. 
I.  The owner of a vicious or dangerous animal shall be liable for and shall pay all costs associated with impoundment, removal, care, treatment and potentially euthanasia of said animal. 
J.  If the owner of the animal impounded under subsection A of this section is not reasonably ascertainable at the time of impoundment, the MAS manager shall immediately notify the owner by mail sent to the owner's last known address, postage prepaid, which upon the passage of three days be deemed complete service or by personal service upon the last known address, within five business days after the animal's impoundment. 
K.  The notice of impoundment shall inform the owner of the animal that the owner may request, in writing, a hearing to contest the impoundment. Upon receipt of the notice of impoundment either through personal service or by mail (receipt is complete three days after mailing to the last known address of owner postage prepaid), the owner has seven business days from personal service or ten business days from date of mailing to request a hearing by serving on the MAS manager a written request for the hearing. 
L.  Upon request by the owner of the animal for a hearing under subsection K, a hearing must be held within seven business days after receipt of the request. Notice of the date, time and location of the hearing shall be provided by regular mail to the animal owner requesting the hearing, and the animal owner, if an active phone number is available shall be advised that a copy of the notice of hearing may be picked up from MAS or the court's office. If the owner picks up the notice of hearing the obligation to provide a copy of the notice by regular mail is waived. The impoundment hearing shall determine if the animal poses a risk to public health and safety, as articulated for the definition and description of dangerous and vicious animals herein. The burden of proof for this determination is beyond a reasonable doubt. 
M.  The owner must pay all of the cost of the impoundment and must post sufficient funds to cover the anticipated costs for continued impoundment. The owner may also seek the animal's release upon furnishing evidence that precautions are in place, which satisfy the court that the public's safety and welfare will be protected. Failure to post funds sufficient to pay for the costs of impoundment or getting the animal released constitutes a waiver of any rights the owner may have to a hearing under this chapter and the animal may be humanely euthanized.

B.

(Ord. 16-97 § 1 (part), 1997)

The date set for hearing shall be no more than fifteen days after the city's receipt of the letter of appeal. Failure to file a timely letter of appeal shall be a waiver of the alarm user's right to a hearing; however, the public safety director, in his discretion, may set a date for a hearing if there is cause to believe that it might encourage substantial cooperation from the alarm user. 
C.  Hearing. At the time and place set for the hearing upon the appeal, the public safety director, or a designee, shall hear evidence from the appellant and/or any other interested party, as to whether non-response status or disconnection should be imposed.

D.  Decision. Within forty-eight hours after the conclusion of the hearing, the public safety director, or a designee, shall render a decision on the appeal. The decision shall be final. Notification of the decision shall be mailed to the appellant within three days of the decision.

8.16.010 - Findings. 
A.  The governing body of the city of Casper, Wyoming, hereby finds that: 
1.  Numerous peer reviewed studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. At special risk are children, elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. 
2.  Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, and decreased respiratory function, including broncho-constriction and broncho-spasm. 
3.  Nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work increase their heart disease risk by twenty-five to thirty percent and their lung cancer risk by twenty to thirty percent. 
B.  Accordingly, the governing body finds and declares that the purposes of the ordinance codified in this chapter are: 
1.  To protect the public health, safety, and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment as hereinafter set forth; and 
2.  To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air in the places delineated herein, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 21-18, adopted Dec. 4, 2018, repealed the former Ch. 9.18, §§ 9.18.010-9.18.060, and enacted a new Ch. 9.18 as set out herein. The former Ch. 9.18 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 19-94 § 1 (part), adopted 1994. 

9.18.010 - Purpose and findings. 
    The city council does hereby find that: 
A.  It is the intent of council in enacting this chapter to recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenience travel in public spaces free from intimidating conducts, threats, and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation, or that may give rise to interference with other's activities if they occur in particular settings and contexts; 
B.  Council finds that there are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive, including vocal requests for a donation; carrying or displaying a sign requesting donations; shaking or jingling a cup of change; and ringing a bell in compliance with any applicable noise ordinance; and 
C.  However, council finds that aggressive and intrusive solicitation threatens the security, privacy, and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors; and 
D.  Council also finds that the presence of solicitors in certain specific areas (such as near to or adjacent to automatic teller machines, adjacent to sidewalk cafes, open window cafes, at public bus stops, and in public garages in the nighttime) create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their privacy, freedom of movement, and personal security; and 
E.  Council further finds that certain forms of solicitation impede the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and leads to concerns regarding traffic and public safety, including that of the solicitor, particularly in congested roadways and sidewalks (as defined below to include highly traveled areas, lines to enter buildings, historic districts with narrow sidewalks or on traffic medians or the obstructing of traffic on high-speed or high-volume streets and highways); and 
F.  This chapter is not intended impermissibly to limit an individual's right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation; rather it aims to impose specific time, place, and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances; namely, limiting aggressive panhandling, panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly threatening and dangerous, and panhandling in places where people are a "captive audience" and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of inescapable confrontations, intimidation or over reaching; and 
G.  In promulgating this chapter, council seeks to impose regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant governmental interests. 
(Ord. No. 21-18, 12-4-2018) 
9.18.020 - Definitions. 
A.  "Aggressive begging, panhandling, or solicitation" includes the following forms of conduct:

(Ord. No. 21-18, 12-4-2018) 
9.18.030 - Passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation-When regulated.

Both aggressive and passive begging, panhandling, charitable or political solicitation within streets and highway rights of way, or on small traffic medians (under ten square feet in size), or on traffic medians located on high speed and high-volume traffic corridors as identified in this chapter, give rise to an increased risk of injury to solicitors on medians, traffic congestion, and traffic accidents that may affect drivers or solicitors. 
2.  Alternative Sites. This chapter provides ample alternative sites for passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation in areas that do not give rise to enhanced public safety concerns or personal privacy and security concerns. 
3.  The city council has undertaken from its own observations and inquiries to identify high speed and high volume traffic corridors that likewise are especially dangerous, in order to assure that these regulations are grounded in appropriate governmental concerns, are narrowly tailored, and allow alternative avenues for communication.

12.16.090 - Performance of work. 
    All work performed pursuant to the issuance of an excavation permit shall be done as follows: 
A.  Where trench structure excavation requires the removal of curb gutter, concrete sidewalks, or asphaltic or concrete pavement by means of backhoes, graders or loaders, the asphalt or concrete shall be cut before any excavating in a straight line parallel to the edge of the excavation by the use of a spade bitted air hammer, concrete saw, or similar approved equipment, to obtain a straight vertical edge. 
B.  When trench excavation is performed by a trencher, asphalt pavement need not be cut prior to excavating operations. However, should trenching operations begin to pull, lift and/or tear existing asphalt pavement, the trenching operation shall be discontinued until the asphalt is cut parallel to the edge of the excavation. The city engineer or his/her designee shall retain sole authority to determine whether the asphalt shall be cut prior to any excavating. The minimum width of pavement removal for utilities greater than six feet in depth shall not be less than eight feet, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. All necessary corners shall be cut at not more than a forty-five degree angle to the trench excavation. 
C.  Upon completion of trenching and backfilling, applicant shall cut and remove both edges of the asphalt or concrete pavement, one foot wider than the edge of the excavation. The cutting method shall be similar to that previously described. 
D.  Rotomilling may be substituted instead of trimming asphalt or concrete pavement as outlined in subsection B above. This work shall include rotomilling both trench edges twelve inches wide to a depth no less than one and one-half inches. Rotomilling of trench edges shall not be considered an approved option if the trench excavation material is of a noncohesive property and undermines any edge of the existing asphalt pavement. 
E.  All applicable asphaltic materials, equipment, paving plant requirements, construction methods, and testing and sampling shall meet those technical specifications in Article 8 of the standards. 
F.  A bituminous tack coat shall be applied to all curbs, gutter, sidewalk and existing pavement edges prior to any pavement replacement. All materials and procedures shall be in accordance with the technical specifications in Article 7, Bituminous Tack Coat, of the standards. 
G.  All applicable portland cement materials, equipment, batching plant equipment, construction requirements, execution of work, conditioning of subgrade, placing concrete, and finish work shall meet those technical specifications set forth in the standard specifications for public works construction and infrastructure improvements. 
H.  All trench backfilling shall be performed in accordance with standards set forth in the standard specifications for public works construction and infrastructure improvements. 
I.  Upon completion of the work, all surplus construction materials and debris shall be removed, leaving the entire site free, clean, and in a neat condition. 
J.  The applicant or his agent shall be responsible for the removal and replacement of the concrete curb, gutter, and sidewalk, and pavement, and such shall be made within seven working days after backfill completed, weather permitting. 
K.  All excavation, backfilling and resurfacing work shall be performed by the applicant or his agent. Upon completion of the work, the applicant or his agent shall give immediate notice to the city engineer that such work has been completed. 
L.  The applicant shall assume the responsibility for any damage to underground facilities caused by the trenching, backfilling, resurfacing, or any other activities of the work. 
M.  Where excavations occur in unpaved surfaces, the area shall be restored by placing a minimum of two inches of stabilized gravel on the surface of the excavation. Stabilized gravel shall be equal to material meeting Wyoming coarse concrete aggregate (minus three-fourths inch) as specified in the standards. 
N.  1.  The minimum thickness for asphaltic concrete pavement shall be:

2.  The city engineer's office will provide to the applicant, the functional classification of the street. Exemptions to the above pavement replacement guideline may only be granted by the city engineer. 
O.  All topsoil and sod removed by the contractor shall be replaced. 
P.  When making excavations, the various materials excavated shall be piled separately. All concrete and bituminous materials, any soils which cannot be properly compacted, and all other deleterious materials shall be removed from the construction site and properly disposed of in accordance with applicable laws. 
Q.  All materials used for backfilling shall be compactible so as to meet the minimum density and moisture requirements spelled out in the city's construction standards. Backfill material may contain coarse materials up to six inches in diameter, but shall be free from large pieces of rock, frozen material, concrete, roots, stumps, tin cans, rubbish, and other similar articles whose presence in the backfill would, in the opinion of the city engineer or his/her designee, cause settlement of the trench or damage to the installed improvement. Material shall have a maximum plasticity index of six and not exhibit pumping characteristics when proof rolled. 
R.  All backfill shall be placed to be thoroughly compacted utilizing compaction methods suitable for the type of backfill being placed and to meet the city specifications for minimum density. 
S.  As a condition of the permit, the applicant shall guarantee his work for a period of two years from the date of final completion of the work. If settlement equal to or greater than one-half inch or pavement separation equal to or greater than one-quarter inch occurs at the site of the excavation, or immediately adjacent thereto, at any time within two years from the date of final completion of the original restoration, the applicant shall be responsible for repairing such settled or separated areas in accordance with the directions of the city engineer.

13.05.070 - Water meter maintenance. 
A.  General. The city shall own, operate and maintain all water meters, remote readout devices and automatic meter reading equipment. Clearances for accessibility to the meter must be provided by the customer in accordance to Section 13.05.060 of this chapter. 
B.  Should damage result to metering equipment; including water meters, remote readout devices and automatic meter reading equipment, from molestation or willful neglect by the customer, the water service may be discontinued. In addition to other costs of discontinuing the service, the city will repair or replace such equipment and bill the customer for all costs incurred, for which the customer shall be solely liable. 
    If a meter is damaged due to freezing, repair costs shall be billed to the customer in accordance to fees set by resolution for the first freezing incident, and each succeeding incident during a three-year period. 
    Repair of larger meters (one and one-half-inch and larger) damaged by freezing may require additional costs to be assessed to the customer. 
C.  When a customer makes a complaint that the municipal water/wastewater charges for any particular billing period are excessive, the city shall, upon request, have the water meter reread. If the customer remains dissatisfied and desires that the meter be tested, the city shall then test the meter for accuracy. The city shall test the meter once every three years at no cost to the customer. The customer may be present when such test is made. 
    In the event that the meter test shows an error of over three percent of the water consumed in favor of the city, a correctly registering meter will be installed, with a possible water and sewer bill adjustment. Such adjustments shall not be retroactive for more than one year without specific approval of the city council. The minimum charge, or base charge, will not be affected. 
    If the customer desires the meter to be tested greater than once every three years and the test shows accurate measurements of water, or an error in favor of the customer, the customer shall be billed to cover the expense of making the meter accuracy test. 
D.  When the water meter fails to register for any period and the reason for the malfunction is beyond the reasonable control of the city, the city may estimate the charge for municipal water and wastewater service during the period in question. 
E.  The city may inspect, test, repair, or replace the water meter, water service line shut-off valve, remote readout device, and automatic meter reading equipment at any reasonable time, as provided in Section 13.05.040(A) of this chapter. The city may shut off the water service to a customer who denies the city access to the above described equipment for any such test, repair or replacement, and the city may further temporarily shut off water service to a customer for the purposes of any such repair or replacement. 
F.  It is prohibited for any person to bypass or tamper with the water meter. If the meter seal is broken, or the working parts of the meter have been tampered with, or the meter has been damaged or bypassed, the city will, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, estimate the time of period the tampering took place and will render an estimated bill for that time period to the customer involved. The city will also bill the customer for the full cost of repairing such damage to the meter and accessories, and may refuse to furnish water until the customer's account is paid in full. 
G.  A customer requesting relocation of a water meter shall bear all costs associated with relocating the water meter, remote readout device, automatic meter reading equipment, dual check valve, and expansion tank. 
H.  The customer shall, at his/her expense, keep his/her outside meter pit or vault and appurtenances in good repair, readily accessible, and in a safe and useable condition at all times. Failure to do so shall be deemed just cause to discontinue water and wastewater service to the customer.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-13, amended ch. 13.17, §§ 13.17.010-13.17.090, in its entirety. At the editor's discretion it has been treated as repealing and replacing ch. 13.17. Former ch. 13.17 pertained to similar subject matter and was derived from Ord. No. 28-93, § 1 (part), adopted 1993. 

13.17.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is as follows: 
A.  To protect the public potable water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating, within its customers' internal distribution system(s), such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or back-siphon into the public water system; 
B.  To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the customer's in-plant potable water system(s) and nonpotable systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial piping systems; and, 
C.  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems by cross-connection. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.020 - Authority. 
A.  The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments provide that water suppliers have the primary responsibility for preventing water from unapproved sources, or any other substances, from entering public potable water systems. 
B.  The state department of environmental quality in its water quality rules and regulations, chapter 12 "Design and Construction Standards for Public Water Supplies" specifies requirements for cross connection control for public water supplies.

(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.040 - Responsibility. 
    The implementation of this chapter requires the full cooperation of the consumer and the city (represented by the city building inspection office and the public utilities office). 
    The interests and responsibilities of each are delineated as follows: 
A.  Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility for preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his potable water system or the public water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the point of delivery (service connection curb stop) and includes all of his internal water system. The consumer, at his own expense, shall install, operate, test, and maintain approved backflow prevention devices as required by this chapter. 
B.  City Building Inspection Office. The city, through the plumbing inspector of the city building inspection office, has the responsibility to review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed, so as to prevent cross-connections from being designed and built into structures within the plumbing inspector's jurisdiction. The plumbing official's inspection responsibility begins at the curb stop connection or water meter pit (on the customer side at this location) and continues throughout the entire extent of the customer's potable water system. Where any possibility that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually indicated by the plans, it shall be mandatory that approved backflow prevention devices be indicated by the plans, as determined by the degree of hazard that the inspector reasonably determines will be present, and such devices shall be properly installed. 
C.  Casper Public Utilities Office. The city, through its utility office, the city public utilities office, has the responsibility of owning, operating and maintaining the public water system beginning at the source of supply and including adequate treatment facilities, a public water distribution system and service piping, and ending at the point of delivery to the consumer's water system (service connection curb stop). In addition, the city public utilities shall exercise reasonable vigilance to insure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. If, in the judgment of the administrator, an approved backflow device is required at the city's water service connection to any customer's premises, the administrator, or his delegated agent, may require by notice in writing to said customer, that approved backflow prevention devices be installed. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.050 - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply to this chapter: 
A.  "Administrator" means the city manager or his appointed designee. 
B.  "Approved" means accepted by the administrator as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this chapter, or as suitable for the proposed use. 
C.  "Approved backflow prevention device" means a device that has been certified by the American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE), the International Association of Plumbing/Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), or the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, University of Southern California (USC-FCCCHR) in accordance with state department of environmental quality water quality chapter 12 rules and regulations.

13.17.070 - Requirements. 
A.  City. 
1.  For new installations, a hazard classification surveyor will provide on-site evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform an inspection of installation. Cross-connection or backflow control devices installed for new or remodeled premises shall be as required by Title 15, "Buildings and Construction" and specifically Chapter 15.24, "Plumbing Code" and this chapter. Under no circumstances is this chapter to be construed as superseding any of the requirements of Title 15, "Buildings and Construction" and specifically Chapter 15.24, "Plumbing Code." 
2.  For existing commercial/ or industrial premises, the hazard classification surveyor will perform hazard classification surveys and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, a suggested method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made. The time allowed for actual installation of backflow/back-siphonage equipment shall be determined based on the hazard classification presented by each individual situation, as determined by the administrator, or his delegated agent. Premises found to be in need of cross-connection or backflow prevention devices, but also noted by the administrator to exhibit a low hazard classification, shall be allowed no more than thirty months to provide the necessary cross-connection or backflow prevention device. Failure or refusal to install the required device(s) shall constitute grounds for enforcement in accordance to Section 13.17.110 which includes discontinuing water service to the premises until such device(s) have been properly installed. 
3.  The administrator will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer, which will be regularly tested by a backflow assembly tester in accordance to Section 13.17.100 to insure satisfactory operation. 
4.  If the administrator determines at any time that a high hazard classification is present and a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service for that premises will be terminated immediately. 
5.  Existing and future residential properties shall be specifically excluded from the requirements of this chapter unless determined otherwise by a hazard classification. However, all new and/or modified residential properties having a separate residential fire sprinkler system shall be required to have a backflow preventor. 
6.  Under no circumstances shall this chapter be construed to require existing or future domestic non-residential consumers commercial or industrial premises of no known hazard to the potable water system from cross-connections or backflow events to install or operate cross-connection or backflow prevention equipment unless determined otherwise by a hazard classification and/or unless a separate domestic non-residential fire sprinkler system is installed. 
B.  Consumer. 
1.  The consumer shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross-connections on his premises. 
2.  The consumer, after having been informed by a letter from the administrator, shall at his expense install, maintain and test, or have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises. Backflow preventers shall be tested at the consumer's cost by a backflow assembly tester at intervals in accordance to Section 13.17.100. 
3.  The consumer shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic testing. 
4.  The consumer shall inform the administrator of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also of any existing cross-connections of which the consumer is aware, but has not been identified by the city public utilities office or the city plumbing inspector. 
5.  The consumer shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Consumers who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. 
6.  The consumer shall install an approved backflow prevention device in accordance with Chapter 13.05 and other chapters of this Code, and in a manner approved by the public services department and the city building inspection office. Drains for reduced pressure principle backflow preventers or reduced pressure principle detector backflow preventers must be sized to accommodate the probable discharge from the preventer. Drains, specifically installed for reduced pressure principle backflow preventers or reduced pressure principle detector backflow preventers, can be plumbed to daylight. 
7.  Any consumer having a private well or other private water source shall inform the administrator if the well or source is cross-connected to the city's potable water system. Permission to cross-connect may be denied by the administrator. The consumer may be required to install a backflow preventer at the service connection if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the city's potable water system. 
8.  In the event the consumer installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes which is on the public utilities' side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed. 
9.  The consumer shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for annual (or more frequent) device testing, retesting in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for noncompliance with this chapter. 
10.  A residential fire sprinkler system or a domestic non-residential fire sprinkler system having a water service meter one-inch in size or smaller and having a separate fire sprinkler system shall have the sprinkler system connected after the incoming water meter. In addition a proper backflow preventor will be required on the separate fire sprinkler line. 
11.  All fire sprinkler systems one and one-half-inch and larger shall have a separate service line from the water main to the building. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.080 - Hazard classification. 
A.  The city recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be categorized by hazard classification and will require the installation of approved cross-connection or backflow prevention devices. 
B.  Fire sprinkler systems shall generally be considered a low hazard classification and a double detector check valve assembly shall be used. If the system requires the use of an anti-freeze solution, only water solutions of pure glycerine or propylene glycol, meeting Table 3-5.2.1 of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 13, Installation of Sprinkler Systems - latest edition, as it may be amended from time to time, shall be utilized. The non-hazardous anti-freeze must meet all requirements of the national sanitation foundation (NSF). Residential fire sprinkler systems or domestic non-residential fire sprinkler systems shall generally be considered a low hazard classification and a double check valve assembly shall be used for the sprinkler system unless determined otherwise by a hazard classification 
    If other anti-freeze solution, such as ethylene glycol are used in the fire sprinkler system, this is considered a high hazard classification and a reduced pressure principle detector backflow preventer shall be used. 
    If existing fire sprinkler systems to be retrofitted have head loss problems, the owner shall consult with the administrator to develop a solution. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.090 - Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. 
    Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the administrator to continue in service unless hazard classification is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the hazard classification has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to an at-risk business establishment, the existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a device providing protection for the new hazard classification present, as determined by the administrator. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.100 - Periodic testing. 
A.  It shall be the duty of the consumer at any commercial or industrial establishment where backflow prevention devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once every year. In those instances where the administrator deems the hazard classification to be great enough he may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. Double check valves used for residential or domestic non-residential fire sprinkler systems with water service lines and meters one-inch in size or smaller will not have to be tested. However, it is up to the owner to ensure the device is working. 
B.  Periodic inspections and tests shall be at the sole expense of the consumer. 
C.  Inspections shall be performed by a backflow assembly tester as certified (Section 13.17.050(F). It shall be the duty of the consumer to see that these tests are made in a timely manner, and that the results of these tests are submitted to the administrator within one-month of the expiration of the prescribed time period, the actual test having been performed not more than three months prior to the expiration of the prescribed time period. 
D.  Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the consumer. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owners' expense to insure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately unless a short compliance date is granted by the administrator. In other low hazard situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty days after the test date will be established by the administrator. The consumer is responsible for spare parts, repair tools or a replacement device. 
E.  Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in Section 13.17.100 in cases where the hazard classification indicates a high hazard or there is a history of test failures. The administrator shall determine the testing schedule based upon the degree of hazard. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by the consumer. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, 6-4-2013) 
13.17.110 - Enforcement. 
    The city may use any or all the following methods to achieve compliance with this chapter: 
A.  The city building inspector may deny or revoke building and/or occupancy permits on property where the consumer has not installed the proper backflow preventers. 
B.  The city may, in the event of noncompliance, physically disconnect the water service from its existing water facilities. The consumer or owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with disconnecting and reconnecting the water service. 
C.  A violation of this Chapter shall be a misdemeanor, punishable according to Chapter 1.28. In addition to any criminal prosecution, the city may sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  Knowingly furnishing false information to the administrator on any matter relating to the administration of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable according to Chapter 1.28.

a.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports in this section and Section 13.36.080, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, hexavalent chromium and volatile organics for facilities which historical sampling data do not exists; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For all other pollutants, twenty-four hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The POTW may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples, over the normal workday operation, where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged, 
b.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subdivision, 
c.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR, Section 403.6(e), in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW, 
d.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contained sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the approval authority determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the approval authority, 
e.  The POTW may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures, 
f.  The report shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW;

The scheduled completion date shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable categorical standard. The following conditions shall apply to this schedule: 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable categorical standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.), 
b.  No increment referred to in paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall exceed nine months, 
c.  Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the city including as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city; 
10.  Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes, and rate of production; 
11.  Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum per day); 
12.  Number and type of employees, and hours of operation of plant and proposed or actual hours of operation of pretreatment system; 
13.  A listing of any toxic pollutant which the applicant uses or manufactures as an intermediate or final product or byproduct; 
14.  Signature of an authorized representative of the user and certified to by a qualified professional indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and additional pretreatment is required; 
15.  A list of any environmental control permits by or for the facility; 
16.  Any other information as may be deemed by the city to be necessary to evaluate the permit application. 
B.  Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Decisions. The superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information.

Article II. - Discharge Conditions and Reporting Requirements 

13.36.070 - Basis for effluent limitations. 
A.  Effluent limitations shall be based upon the more stringent of the following: 
1.  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards; 
2.  State pretreatment requirements; or 
3.  Local limitations calculated by mass balance or other valid scientific methods necessary to protect the POTW from materials described in Section 13.32.030. 
B.  The basis for effluent limitations will be reviewed as part of the NPDES permit application (every five years). 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.080 - Compliance-Initial report. 
A.  Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to categorical standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process, which are limited by categorical standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such categorical standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable categorical standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a professional engineer. 
B.  Industrial users shall immediately notify the city and as soon as possible thereafter the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261, as enacted or hereafter amended, or any applicable federal regulations. The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of the industrial user's contribution permit. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.090 - Compliance-Periodic report. 
A.  Any significant industrial users shall submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the city, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards or permits. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows, which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in Section 13.36.020. At the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
    In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
    All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
B.  The city may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection A of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the proper chain of custody report, the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the city, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the approval authority pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the approval authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the approval authority. Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the approval authority. 
C.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in subsection A of this section or Section 13.36.110 (40 CFR 403.12(h)) monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in subsection B of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(Ord. 8-08 §§ 5-7, 2008; Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.100 - Notice of change in discharge. 
    All permitted industrial users shall notify the POTW in writing within forty-five days of when their discharge changes significantly. A significant change shall include changes to the pollutant concentration levels, discharges of previously unreported pollutants, or flow increases of ten percent or greater. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.110 - Reports from noncategorical industrial users. 
    All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall provide appropriate reports to the POTW as the city may require. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.120 - Confidentiality-Conditions. 
A.  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
B.  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report, which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available to any person unless required under applicable state law. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
C.  Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public, except as provided by Wyoming law. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.130 - Automatic resampling. 
    If the results of the industrial user's wastewater analysis indicate a violation has occurred, the user must notify the POTW within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation and repeat the sampling and pollutant analysis and submit, in writing, the results of this repeat analysis within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. 
    If the city performs the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. (See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(2)). 
(Ord. 8-08 § 8, 2008: Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.140 - Timing. 
    Written reports required by the industrial user's wastewater contribution permit will be deemed to have been submitted to the POTW on the date postmarked if mailed via U.S. mail, postage prepaid. If not mailed as set forth, then the date of receipt of the report at the POTW shall govern. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.145 - Recordkeeping. 
    Users subject to the reporting requirements of this section shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this section, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under Section 13.32.030. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
(Ord. 8-08 § 9, 2008) 
13.36.150 - Accidental discharge-Protection required-Notification. 
A.  Each permitted industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this division shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. 
B.  In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
C.  Significant industrial users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge. 
(Ord. 8-08 § 10, 2008; Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000)

    Within five days following an accidental discharge, the permitted industrial user shall submit to the city a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person, property or the environment; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.170 - Accidental discharge-Notice to employees. 
    A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such an accidental discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.180 - Accidental spill or slug control plans. 
A.  Industrial users that store hazardous substances shall not contribute to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this division unless a spill prevention plan has been approved by the city. Approval of such plans shall not relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and regulations governing the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances. 
B.  The city must evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a slug control plan to control slug discharges as defined in the definitions and abbreviations sections of this division. The plan shall contain at least the following elements: 
1.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharge; 
2.  Description of stored chemicals; 
3.  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges as required by Section 13.36.150(B), including any discharge that would violate a specific prohibition of this section with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days;

Article III. - Compliance Monitoring 

13.36.190 - Monitoring facilities. 
A.  The city requires that monitoring facilities be provided and operated, at the user's expense, to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility shall normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will be accessible by the city. 
B.  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
C.  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following written notification by the city. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.200 - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, or its representatives, ready access at all times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. The city and/or EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city and/or EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(Ord. 8-08 § 12, 2008; Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000) 
13.36.210 - Sample collection. 
A.  Except as indicated in subsection B of this section, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is unfeasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a minimum of four grab samples during the operating period of the facility where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
B.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, chromium VI, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques or as amended hereafter by the EPA. 
C.  Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
D.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in Sections 13.36.050 and 13.36.080 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 13.36.090 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

7.  Fees to control excessive amounts of floatable grease, sand or other harmful ingredients not properly removed by existing interceptors or handling procedures; and 
8.  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
B.  These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the city. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 10-91 § 3(w), 1991: Ord. 8-85 § 1 (part), 1985: prior code § 39-31) 
13.40.020 - Operation and maintenance cost determination authority. 
    The city shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater systems, which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency fund. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 10-91 § 3(x), 1991: Ord. 42-84 § 1, 1984) 
13.40.030 - Wastewater contribution percentage determination method. 
A.  The city shall determine for each user or user class the average daily volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user's volume contribution percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow. 
B.  The city shall determine for each user or user class the average daily poundage of five-day, twenty degree centigrade biochemical demand (BOD) discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all five-day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user's BOD contribution percentage. 
C.  The city shall determine for each user or user class the average daily total suspended solids (TSS) poundage discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all TSS discharged to the wastewater system, to determine such user's TSS contribution percentage. The volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution percentage and TSS contribution percentage for each user or user class shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, total five-day twenty degree centigrade BOD and total TSS, respectively. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 10-91 § 3(y), 1991: Ord. 42-84 § 2, 1984) 
13.40.040 - Surcharge rate determination method. 
    The city will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above-normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two hundred parts per million BOD and two hundred fifty parts per million TSS. The surcharge rate structure for such above-normal strength waste dischargers will be assessed in accordance to the sewer service rate schedule set out by resolution, as adopted by the city council. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 10-91 § 3(z), 1991: Ord. 42-84 § 3, 1984) 
13.40.050 - Wastewater service charge determination method. 
    Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as determined in Sections 13.40.030 and 13.40.040 shall be added together to determine each user's annual wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and an equitable service charge may be determined for each user based on an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The city council may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential establishments as a residential user; provided that the wastes from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user with respect to volume, total suspended solids and BOD. Each user's wastewater treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the sewer service rate schedule set out by resolution, as adopted by the city council. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 42-84 § 4, 1984) 
13.40.060 - Rates and charges-Notification to user. 
    Each user will be notified at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges that are attributable to wastewater treatment services. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 42-84 § 8, 1984) 
13.40.070 - Wastewater service charge-Review and adjustment. 
    The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than every year and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. The city shall apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year and adjust the rate accordingly. If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body, such factual information and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed. The city shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 24-92 § 1, 1992: Ord. 10-91 § 3(aa), 1991: Ord. 42-84 § 7, 1984) 
13.40.080 - Wastewater service charge-Payment and late charge penalty. 
    The city shall submit a bimonthly statement to the user for the user's wastewater service charge. The city shall add a penalty of one and one-half percent per month if the payment is not received by the city within thirty days. Should any user fail to pay the user wastewater service charge and penalty within two months of the due date, the city may terminate wastewater service to the property. 
(Ord. 56-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 10-91 § 3(bb), 1991: Ord. 42-84 § 6, 1984) 
13.40.090 - Wastewater facilities replacement fund. 
    A reserve fund called the wastewater facilities replacement fund is established within the city's funds for the purpose of providing sufficient moneys to be expended for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories and appurtenances during the useful life of the wastewater treatment facilities necessary to maintain the capacity and performance for which such facilities are designed and constructed. 
    The wastewater facilities replacement fund shall be interest bearing and shall be funded by annual deposits.

All applications received shall be approved, rejected or returned for correction as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than ninety days after receipt. 
B.  It shall be the duty of the city manager to reject all applications, and refuse to issue a solar permit sought, for the following reasons:

15.32.160 - Applications to void permits. 
A.  An application shall be made to the city manager by the owner or possessor of real property to whom a solar permit has been issued or transferred in accordance with state law, when such owner or possessor of real property desires to void, in whole or in part, such permit. The application shall identify the permit which is requested to be voided, and, in the event the person requesting the permit is not the person to whom the original permit was granted, the application shall be accompanied by an instrument or instruments showing that the applicant is the legal owner of the solar right. If the permit is to be voided only in part, the application shall specify with particularity that portion of the permit which is to be voided, and the city manager may require that the application shall show information required in Section 15.32.070 through 15.32.090 above. Upon partially voiding a solar permit, the city manager shall issue an amended solar permit to the permittee. 
B.  No application to void a solar permit wholly or in part shall be granted if the granting of such application will injuriously affect the property rights of another person, unless such person consents to the granting of such application in writing. 
C.  The issuance of an amended solar permit shall not affect the priority of the original solar right granted and which is amended. 
(Ord. 16-83 Art. 2 § 3, 1983) 
15.32.170 - Correction of errors in permits. 
    The city manager is authorized, upon written petition of a permittee, to amend any solar permit, for the purpose of correcting errors or otherwise, when in his opinion such amendment appears desirable or necessary, provided that the amendment shall not have the effect of enlarging the solar right granted so that it will injuriously affect the property rights of an adjacent property owner. The city manager may require any and all reasonable information necessary to make such determination. When any permit is corrected, as provided in this section, the city manager shall issue a corrected solar permit to the permittee, and the issuance of the corrected permit shall not affect the priority of the permit originally issued. 
(Ord. 16-83 Art. 2 § 4, 1983) 
15.32.180 - Location of solar collectors. 
    Solar collectors shall be located on the owner's property so as not to unreasonably or unnecessarily restrict the uses of neighboring property.

A solar right which is not applied to a beneficial use for a period of five years or more shall be deemed abandoned and without priority. 
(Ord. 16-83 Art. 3 § 2, 1983) 
15.32.200 - Solar rights-Time restrictions and priority. 
    The solar right to radiation of the sun before nine a.m. or after three p.m., Mountain Standard Time, is de minimus, and may be infringed without compensation to the owner of the solar collector. Priority in time shall have the better right in disputes over the use of solar energy. The priority of new construction, with regard to interference in solar rights, shall vest as of the date the building permit for such construction is applied for. 
(Ord. 16-83 Art. 3 § 1, 1983) 
15.32.210 - Solar rights-Vesting and certification. 
A.  Solar rights vest on the date which the city manager grants the solar permit. The solar collector for which a solar permit has been granted shall be put to beneficial use within two years of the date of the permit, except the city manager may allow additional time upon request of the permittee to certify within two years of the date of the permit to the city manager, by sworn affidavit, that the solar collector for which the solar permit has been issued has been constructed and put to beneficial use in accordance with the solar permit. 
B.  Upon the receipt of the city manager of such sworn certification, he shall have the authority to inspect the solar collection system, including the solar collector, to assure that beneficial use is being made of the solar collector. 
1.  In the event that the city manager does find that the solar collector is being beneficially used, he shall certify the solar right and its beneficial use, in writing, and deliver such certification to the permittee. Such certification shall be a form which may be recorded in the office of the county clerk. 
2.  In the event the city manager finds that the solar collector for which the solar permit has been issued is not being beneficially used as provided in the solar permit and the application for a solar permit, he shall have the right to refuse to certify the solar right and its beneficial use. 
3.  In the event the city manager refuses to certify the solar right and its beneficial use, as provided in this section, the permittee may appeal his decision to the board, as provided in this chapter. 
C.  It shall be the duty and obligation of the permittee to record in the office of the county clerk the certification of the right and its beneficial use upon receipt of the same from the city manager. When any solar right is certified, a record of the same shall be made in a book for that purpose in the office of the engineering director. 
D.  In the event a permittee fails to put a solar collector to beneficial use within two years after a permit is issued for such solar collector, or fails to certify the beneficial use as provided in this section, the permit and all rights granted shall be thereby null and void, and of no further force and effect. 
(Ord. 16-83 Art. 2 § 10, 1983) 
15.32.220 - Solar rights-Recordation. 
    Upon the grant of a solar permit to a permittee, it shall be his obligation and duty to record the same in the office of the county clerk, and neither the city manager nor the city shall have any obligation to assure that the permit is recorded. Upon the certification of the solar right and its beneficial use, it shall be the permittee's obligation to record the same. 
(Ord. 16-83 Art. 2 § 11, 1983)

Contiguous or adjacent areas to be included in the design and the tributary population to be provided for shall be subject to approval by the city. All mains ten inches and larger shall be sized and located in accordance with the current master plan of wastewater facilities; provided, however, the city reserves and has the right to specify sizes and locations, including those not delineated on the master plan. 
C.  Design Flows. 
1.  Sanitary sewers must be designed to carry the peak discharge and to transport suspended material so that deposition in the sewer is precluded. 
2.  The consultant shall substantiate and have approved by the city population densities per acre or per unit. 
3.  New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily per capita flow of not less than one hundred gallons per day. This figure is assumed to provide for a normal infiltration, but an additional allowance should be made where conditions are unfavorable. To provide for peak loads, sanitary sewers shall be designed for peak flow to average flow at 0.75 pipe diameter depth, ratios of 4:1 for lateral sewers (eight inches); 3.5:1 for collector sewers (ten inches through fifteen inches); and 2.5:1 for interceptor sewers (eighteen inches and larger). 
4.  When deviations from the foregoing procedure are requested, a description of the design procedure used shall be submitted with the plans and specifications for approval.

In general, sanitary sewers shall be designed with sufficient depth to permit floor drains from basements to be connected, unless in subdivisions or areas in which no basements are to be constructed, in which instance, the developer shall sign a statement to this fact on all plans presented for approval. In no case shall sanitary sewers be designed for a depth of cover less than thirty-six inches over the top of the pipe or sewer. Where shallower depths are unavoidable, consideration may be given to the construction of epoxy-lined or polyurethane-lined ductile iron, or similarly protected sewer, with or without insulation, as circumstance may direct. Proper allowance for loads on the sewer shall be made because of width and depth of trench. Rigid pipe shall have a minimum factor of safety of 1.5. Flexible pipe shall have a minimum factor of safety of 1.25. Where necessary, special construction will be required. 
E.  Velocity of Flow. 
1.  All sewers shall be designed and constructed with hydraulic slopes sufficient to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second, based on Manning's formula, using a value for "n" of 0.013. The following shall be the minimum slopes to be provided:

A.  It is the intent of this title to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue until they are removed or are abandoned, but not to encourage their continuance. It is recognized that there exist within the zoning districts established by this title, lots, structures, and uses of land which were lawful before this title was adopted and which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under its present terms. Such lots, structures, and uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted lots, structures, and uses in the district involved. It is the intent of this title that, unless otherwise provided for, such nonconforming uses of land or structures, shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for adding additions to existing structures or new structures or uses otherwise prohibited which would increase their nonconformity. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for three hundred sixty-five calendar days, any future use of the land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this title. 
B.  A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land, shall not be extended or enlarged after the passage of this title by alteration of a building or premises or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited in the zoning district involved, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this title, or any building upon which a building permit has been issued and construction has not begun. If demolition or removal of an existing structure is involved, such demolition or removal shall be considered as part of the construction. 
C.  There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming use of land, structure, or land and structure, providing the use is continuous and there is not a change or expansion of such nonconforming use. 
D.  Nonconforming residential structures that are damaged or destroyed may be reconstructed or repaired to the extent that the reconstructed square footage does not exceed the square footage that existed on January 1, 2007 by greater than ten percent and provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The repair or reconstruction meets the provisions of the Casper Municipal Code, and all other applicable law and regulations in effect at the time of the repair or reconstruction; and 
2.  The repair or reconstruction commences within three hundred sixty-five days from the date of damage or destruction; and 
3.  The residential structure was used entirely for residential use within the previous three hundred sixty-five days prior to the damage or destruction; and 
4.  If the repair or reconstruction is suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty days after the time the work is commenced, the building permit shall become invalid. The community development director or his or her designee is authorized to grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for periods of not more than one hundred eighty days each. All extensions shall be in writing with justifiable cause demonstrated.

No division of a lot, lots, or parcel shall be made which leaves the remainder of the lot, lots, or parcel with width or area below the requirements stated in the zoning district in which it is located or would otherwise make it nonconforming. 
(Ord. 5-91 (part), 1991) 
17.12.030 - Nonconforming use of land. 
A.  At the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, if a lawful use of land exists which becomes nonconforming by the terms of this title, the use may continue subject to the following provisions: 
1.  The nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title unless a legal exception has been granted therefor; 
2.  A nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot, tract, or parcel occupied by said use after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title; 
3.  If any nonconforming use of land, except seasonal agricultural use, ceases for any reason for a period of three hundred sixty-five consecutive days or more, any subsequent use of such land shall thereafter conform to this title; 
4.  Where the number of livestock or fowl exceeds the limitations set forth in the regulations for the zoning district in which the land is located, the use shall be allowed to continue, providing that upon the sale or reduction of the livestock or fowl, the number shall not be allowed to increase above the number allowed in that zoning district.

The continued use of all such nonconforming structures is subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Should a structure be in need of repair to allow continued occupancy, or damaged or destroyed by any means the cost of which would exceed seventy-five percent of its replacement cost, exclusive of foundation, as determined by the building official based upon a written bid submitted by a building contractor licensed in the city, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with this title; 
2.  Should any structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to this title. With the exception of a manufactured home (mobile), which may be replaced with a newer model providing placement is otherwise in compliance with the law; 
3.  If any nonconforming use of structures, except seasonal residence for certain periods of the year and agricultural use, ceases for any reason for a period of three hundred sixty-five consecutive days or more, any subsequent use of such land shall thereafter conform to this title. 
B.  A legal nonconforming structure, as defined in subsection A of this section, which is nonconforming as a result of its location in relation to one or more lot lines, may not be enlarged, expanded, or altered, if such would result in the perimeter of the modified structure encroaching into a required front, back, or side yard, further than the perimeter of the existing structure. Garages, however, shall be required to have a minimum front setback of twenty feet.

E.  Distributed Antenna Systems and Small Cells. 
1.  Distributed antenna systems and small cells are allowed in all zones by right (unless they involve the installation of a pole, tower or building) and except for the FC or OYD zones, as long as all other requirements of the zoning district are met along with stealth requirements, regardless of the siting preferences listed in subsection I herein, provided the applicant also complies with all federal laws (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act) and state laws and requirements. 
2.  Distributed antenna systems and small cells in all zones are subject to approval by administrative review unless their installation requires the construction of a new pole, tower or building. A conditional use permit shall not be required for stealth replacement utility support structures, so long as they are substantially similar in height and design. 
3.  A single permit application may be used for multiple distributed antennas that are part of a larger overall DAS network. A single permit application may also be used for multiple small cells spaced to provide wireless coverage in a defined geographic area. A single license agreement may be used for multiple node locations in DAS and/or small cell networks. 
F.  General Requirements. 
1.  Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for a macrocell tower shall provide to the community development department an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one-half mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower or antenna. The community development department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city; provided, however, that the city is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
2.  Color. The antenna array shall be placed and colored to blend into the architectural detail and coloring of the host structure. Support towers shall be painted a color that best allows it to blend into the surroundings. The use of grays, blues, greens, dark bronze, browns or other site specific colors may be appropriate; however, each case will be evaluated individually. 
3.  Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the chief building official or the designee thereof may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding property owners. Security lighting for the equipment shelters or cabinets and other on the ground ancillary equipment is also permitted, as long as it is appropriately down shielded to keep light within the boundaries of the site. 
4.  State or Federal Requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, and if WCF equipment is added either through collocation or replacement, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
5.  Building Permit. A building permit is required for all wireless communication facilities, and shall be subject to the site development standards prescribed herein. A site development plan shall contain the following information: 
a.  Construction drawings showing the proposed method of installation; 
b.  The manufacturer's recommended installations, if any; and 
c.  A diagram to scale showing the location of the wireless communication facility, property and setback lines, easements, power lines, all structures, and required landscaping. 
6.  Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes and the applicable industry standards for towers, as amended from time to time. Compliance with this section is subject to the city Code enforcement procedures, and other applicable provisions of the city Code. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower at the owner's expense. 
7.  Notice. For purposes of this section, any conditional use permit or appeal of a conditional use shall require notice as required by this Code. 
8.  Signs. No facilities may bear any signage or advertisement(s) other than signage required by law or expressly permitted/required by the city. 
9.  Visual Impact. All WCFs in residential uses and zones and within two hundred feet of residential zones or in the downtown area shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible, consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF. Such WCFs and equipment enclosures shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site. Such WCFs shall also be designed to either resemble the surrounding landscape and other natural features where located in proximity to natural surroundings, or be compatible with the built environment, through matching and complimentary existing structures and specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale, color and texture or be consistent with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant zone. 
10.  Use of Stealth Design. The applicant shall provide justification if it is not employing stealth design. Stealth design is required in all zones (for example, in residential zones, the OYD and the downtown area), and concealment techniques must be appropriate given the proposed location, design, visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and natural features. Stealth design shall be designed and constructed to substantially conform to surrounding building designs or natural settings, so as to be visually unobtrusive. Stealth design that relies on screening wireless communication facilities in order to reduce visual impact must screen all substantial portions of the facility from view. Stealth and concealment techniques do not include incorporating faux-tree designs of a kind that are not generally found growing in the city's ecosystem. 
11.  Building-Mounted WCFs. 
a.  All transmission equipment shall be concealed within existing architectural features to the maximum extent feasible. Any new architectural features proposed to conceal the transmission equipment shall be designed to mimic the existing underlying structure, shall be proportional to the existing underlying structure or conform to the underlying use and shall use materials in similar quality, finish, color and texture as the existing underlying structure. 
b.  All roof-mounted transmission equipment shall be set back from all roof edges to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the need for "line-of-sight" transmission and reception of signals. 
c.  Antenna arrays and supporting transmission equipment shall be installed so as to camouflage, disguise or conceal them to make them closely compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure. 
12.  Antenna Arrays. Wireless communication antenna arrays are permitted in any zone as long as they are located upon an existing structure (except on single family houses, signage or a building less than sixty feet in height), that provides sufficient elevation for the array's operation without the necessity of constructing a tower or other apparatus to extend the antenna array more than fifteen feet above the structure. Installation on city property requires the execution of necessary agreements. However, if any support tower is needed to achieve the needed elevation, then a conditional use permit is required. If a new equipment cabinet is to be installed, it must be screened if it is higher than the existing screened facility. 
13.  WCFs in the Public Rights-of-Way. 
a.  Utility Support Structure-Mounted Equipment. All pole-mounted transmission equipment shall be mounted as close as possible to the pole so as to reduce the overall visual profile to the maximum extent feasible. 
b.  License or Agreement. For all WCFs to be located within the right-of-way, prior to submitting for a permit, the applicant must have a valid municipal agreement, license, franchise agreement, right-of-way agreement, encroachment permit or exemption otherwise granted by applicable law. If the applicant is willing to install its ancillary facilities underground, that determination by the city shall be subject to administrative review. 
14.  Accessory Uses. 
a.  Accessory uses shall be limited to such structures and equipment that are necessary for transmission or reception functions, and shall not include broadcast studios, offices, vehicles or equipment storage, or other uses not essential to the transmission or reception functions. 
b.  All accessory buildings shall be constructed of building materials equal to or better than those of the primary building on the site and shall be subject to site plan approval. 
c.  No equipment shall be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless used in direct support of the antennas or the tower that is being repaired. 
15.  Accessory Equipment. In residential zones, all accessory equipment located at the base of a WCF shall be located or placed (at the applicant's choice) in an existing building, underground, or in an equipment shelter that is (a) designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using architecturally compatible construction and colors; and (b) be located so as to be unobtrusive as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF. 
16.  Site Design Flexibility. Individual WCF sites vary in the location of adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other local variables. By mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project could have been placed in more appropriate locations within a given site. Therefore, the WCF and supporting equipment may be installed so as to best camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make the WCF more closely compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure, upon approval by the community development director or the designee thereof. 
17.  General Standards and Construction Provisions. 
a.  All structures shall be constructed and installed to manufacturer's specifications, and constructed as required by the city's currently adopted Building Code, as amended, and required setback provisions as prescribed for the zoning districts. 
b.  Structures shall be permitted and constructed to meet the city's currently adopted Building Code requirements. 
c.  All structures shall conform to FCC and FAA regulations, if applicable. 
d.  If any setback as prescribed within this Code requires a greater distance than required of this section, the greater distance shall apply. 
e.  Landscaping and Fencing. In all zoning districts, the following additional landscaping shall be required beyond that which is required for the zone in which it is located: 
i.  Equipment shelters and cabinets and other on the ground ancillary equipment shall be screened with landscaping as required for the zone in which located or with another design acceptable to the community development department. Alternatively, where technically feasible, the applicant shall incorporate the cabinet and other equipment into the base of a new pole (for example, for a small cell) provided there is adequate space in the right-of-way and that ADA sidewalk accessibility requirements can be met. All provisions of the ADA, including, but not limited to, clear space requirements, shall be met by the applicant. 
ii.  The ground level view of towers shall be mitigated by additional landscaping provisions as established through the conditional use permit process. The use of large trees from the approved urban forestry list of recommended species or native conifers is required at the spacing specified for the specific trees chosen. Alternatively, a landscaping plan may be submitted with the conditional use permit and, if approved, shall take precedence over the foregoing requirement. 
iii.  A site-obscuring fence (for example, solid or slatted wood, faux wood, vinyl, masonry or a combination thereof) no less than six feet in height from the finished grade shall be constructed around each macrocell tower and around related support or guy anchors. Access shall only be through a locked gate. Any fence shall comply with the other design guidelines of this code. 
f.  New Poles. To the extent technically feasible, new poles must be designed to match the existing light fixtures and other poles, and they shall serve a dual purpose (for example, a new light fixture, flag pole or banner clips). 
g.  Other Published Materials. All other information or materials that the city may reasonably require, from time to time, make publicly available and designate as part of the application requirements. 
18.  Insurance. All towers shall be covered by a general liability insurance policy in an amount not less than five hundred thousand dollars. 
19.  Location of WCFs. No WCFs may be located within ten feet of a public utility (for example, water and sewer lines). If a WCF is located in a public right-of-way and the city needs the owner of the WCF to move the WCF, the owner will do so at no cost to the city. 
20.  Sites and Application Appointments. Each application may include up to ten sites in the city. An in-person appointment with city staff is required at the outset of the process for an application for multiple sites. 
G.  Sharing of Support Towers and Collocation of Facilities. 
1.  It is the policy of the city to minimize the number of macrocells and wireless communication support towers and to encourage the collocation of antenna arrays of more than one wireless communication service provider on a single support tower, provided that additional Building Code regulations may apply. 
2.  No new macrocell wireless communication support tower may be constructed within one-half mile of an existing macrocell support tower, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the community development director or the designee thereof that the existing macrocell support tower is not available or feasible for collocation of an additional wireless communication facility, or that its specific location does not satisfy the operational requirements of the applicant. Factors to be considered by the community development director or the designee thereof in determining whether applicant has made this demonstration include those listed below in subsection 4. 
3.  The shared use of towers is encouraged. Applications for macrocells and towers which will, immediately upon completion, operate with more than one user may reduce setback requirements from adjacent nonresidential property. The setback from adjacent nonresidential property may be reduced by twenty-five percent when two users enter into a binding agreement prior to the issuance of the building permit. The setback from adjacent nonresidential property may be reduced by up to fifty percent when three or more users enter into a binding agreement prior to the issuance of the building permit. A binding agreement for the purposes of this subsection is one signed by all parties using the tower and by the affected landowners. This signed agreement will commit the users to occupy the tower immediately upon its completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, fall zones shall be at least one foot for every foot of tower height subject to the breakpoint provisions herein. 
4.  Factors Considered in Granting Conditional Use Permits for Macrocells and Towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of conditional use permit applications pursuant to this Code, the applicant must provide wet stamped plans for macrocell towers, and the planning and zoning commission or city council (as appropriate under Section 17.12.240(C)) shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit. 
a.  Towers exceeding a height of seventy-five feet shall be able to accommodate collocation of one additional provider. Additional height to accommodate additional collocation may be approved if the applicant submits information certifying the tower has capacity for at least two additional providers. The applicant shall provide a letter indicating their good faith intent to encourage collocation on the tower. 
b.  Proximity of the macrocell tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries. 
c.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties. 
d.  Surrounding topography. 
e.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage. 
f.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. 
g.  Proposed ingress and egress. 
h.  Whether existing structures are located within the geographic area that meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
i.  Whether existing towers or structures have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
j.  The applicant's proposed antennas would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
k.  Whether the fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
l.  Whether the applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors not enumerated herein that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
5.  Site Plan. In districts where towers are allowed, applicants are required to submit and be granted an approval for a site plan before a building permit will be issued. The standards set forth in the tower regulations summary of this section will be used to determine tower requirements and whether approval shall be granted or denied. Towers of one hundred twenty-one feet or more require that site plan approval be granted by the city council, following recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. Both the city council and the planning and zoning commission may consider reductions to the setback requirements for such towers as a part of the site plan approval. 
6.  All towers that provide commercial wireless telecommunication service are required to submit a site plan to the city for approval. In addition to the standard site plan requirements (listed in this Title 17), the following information must be supplied with the site plan or building permit application: 
a.  Identification of the intended user(s) of the tower; 
b.  Site and landscape plans drawn to a one inch equals ten feet for one acre or less and one inch equals twenty feet for sites larger than one acre; 
c.  The general capacity of the tower; 
d.  Proposed modifications to any structure, proposed transmission equipment and its location and areas where excavation is proposed; 
e.  An analysis of the area containing existing topographical contours; 
f.  The number and positioning of guy wires and antennas; 
g.  Site plans must show the locations for at least two equipment buildings, even if the tower is proposed for a single user; 
h.  For macrocell towers that are fifty feet or greater in height above the ground, a visual study depicting the zone within a three-mile radius, where any portion of the proposed tower could be seen (scaled vicinity maps); 
i.  Details regarding painting and on-site lighting. 
7.  Placement Provisions-Towers. Towers shall be located only in those areas described in Table 1, provided that towers that are proposed to be located in a residential zone or within two hundred feet of a residential zone or in the downtown area shall be subject to the siting priorities set forth for preferred tower locations in subsection I.

Notwithstanding anything in the table to the contrary, in residential, educational and park-historic districts, new towers shall be limited to the height of power poles if feasible. Prohibited uses in the Old Yellowstone district and South Poplar Street corridor include macrocell towers or any ground, roof or otherwise mounted pole, spire, structure or combination thereof that is fifteen feet or greater in height above the ground, including supporting lines, cables, wires, braces, masts or other structures, for the purpose of mounting an antenna, meteorological device or cellular apparatus above ground unless an exception is granted pursuant to this section. 
8.  Macrocell towers used for the purpose of providing commercial wireless telecommunication services are permitted uses in all districts, except in the downtown area, FC districts, residential districts (R1-R6), planned unit developments (PUD), and the agricultural district (AG). However, a conditional use permit may be granted for small cells providing commercial wireless telecommunication services in residential districts (R1-R6), planned unit developments (PUD), and the agricultural district (AG). Additionally, towers which are placed on buildings must conform to the other requirements of this section. 
9.  All towers shall conform to the following dimensional requirements: 
a.  On Top of Structures. Towers may not be located on top of buildings or structures in any residential districts. In nonresidential districts, towers are permitted on top of buildings or structures (which are not tower accessory structures). The top of such towers shall not be more than ten percent of the building height above the building. 
H.  Setback Requirements. 
1.  Setbacks. A building or structure with a tower shall maintain the normal setback requirements for the zone in which it is located, except as set forth in this subsection. If the tower is in a nonresidential zone, setbacks shall be as follows: 
a.  If the top of the tower is fifty feet or less in height above the ground, then, normal setbacks of the zoning district or structures shall apply, provided that the fall zone shall be at least one foot for every foot of tower height. 
b.  If the top of the tower is more than fifty feet in height above the ground, the setback from the adjacent property line shall be one foot for every one foot in height, or shall be the normal setback of the zoning district, whichever is greater. 
2.  When a residence is located on an adjacent property, the support tower structures shall be set back from property lines as required by that zone or a minimum of one foot for every foot of tower height, whichever produces the greater setback, unless: 
a.  The setback is waived by the owner of the residence; or 
b.  The tower is constructed with breakpoint design technology. If the tower has been constructed using breakpoint design technology, the minimum setback distance shall be equal to one hundred ten percent of the distance from the top of the structure to the breakpoint level of the structure, or the applicable zone's minimum side setback requirements, whichever is greater. For example, on a one hundred-foot tall monopole with a breakpoint at eighty feet, the minimum setback distance would be twenty-two feet (one hundred ten percent of twenty feet, the distance from the top of the monopole to the breakpoint) or the minimum side yard setback requirements for that zone, whichever is greater. Provided, that if an applicant proposes to use breakpoint design technology to reduce the required setback from a residence, the issuance of building permits for the tower shall be conditioned upon approval of the tower design by a structural engineer. 
3.  All towers, radio and television aerials or antennas, dishes capable of receiving electronic transmission from satellites or other sources shall comply with all setbacks within the district in which they are located. All towers and associated equipment shall not interfere with normal radio, television or telephone reception in the vicinity. Commercial messages shall not be displayed on any tower. Violations shall be considered zoning violations and shall be corrected under the enforcement provisions in this Code. 
4.  All equipment shelters, cabinets, or other on the ground ancillary equipment shall meet the setback requirement of the zone in which it is located. 
I.  Preferred Macrocell Tower Locations. All new macrocell towers proposed to be located in a residential zone or within two hundred feet of a residential zone or in the downtown area are permitted only after application of the following siting priorities, ordered from most-preferred (1) to least-preferred (7): 
1.  City-owned or operated property and facilities not in the downtown or residential zones and not including right-of-way; 
2.  Industrial zones; 
3.  Commercial zones; 
4.  Other non-residential zones; 
5.  City rights-of-way in residential zones; 
6.  Parcels of land in residential zones; 
7.  Designated historic structures, downtown and neighborhoods with additional protection. 
The applicant for a macrocell tower located in a residential zone or within two hundred feet of a residential zone or in the downtown area shall address these preferences in an alternative sites analysis prepared pursuant to subsection J below. 
J.  Submittal Requirements. 
1.  Alternative Sites Analysis. 
a.  For macrocell towers in a residential zone or within two hundred feet of a residential zone or in the downtown area, the applicant must address the city's preferred macrocell tower locations with a detailed explanation justifying why a site of higher priority was not selected. The city's macrocell tower location preferences must be addressed in a clear and complete written alternative sites analysis that shows at least three higher ranked, alternative sites considered that are in the geographic range of the service coverage objectives of the applicant, together with a factually detailed and meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate and the proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant rejected the alternative candidate. 
b.  A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection may include less than three alternative sites so long as the applicant provides a factually detailed written rationale for why it could not identify at least three potentially available, higher ranked, alternative sites. 
c.  For purposes of disqualifying potential collocations or alternative sites for the failure to meet the applicant's service coverage objectives, the applicant will provide: (a) a description of its objective, whether it be to close a gap or address a deficiency in coverage, capacity, frequency or technology; (b) detailed technical maps or other exhibits with clear and concise RF data to illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative (whether it be collocation or a more preferred location); and (c) a description of why the alternative (collocation or a more preferred location) does not meet the objective. 
2.  Collocation Consent. A written statement will be signed by a person with the legal authority to bind the applicant and the project owner, which indicates whether the applicant is willing to allow other transmission equipment owned by others to collocate with the proposed wireless communication facility whenever technically and economically feasible and aesthetically desirable. 
3.  Documentation. Applications submitted under this section for towers shall include the following materials: 
a.  Requirement for FCC Documentation. The applicant shall provide a copy of the applicant's FCC license or registration. 
b.  Visual Analysis. A color visual analysis that includes to-scale visual simulations that show unobstructed before-and-after construction daytime and clear-weather views from at least four angles, together with a map that shows the location of each view, including all equipment and ground wires. 
c.  Design Justification. A clear and complete written analysis that explains how the proposed design complies with the applicable design standards under this section to the maximum extent feasible. A complete design justification must identify all applicable design standards under this section and provide a factually detailed reason why the proposed design either complies or cannot feasibly comply. 
d.  Noise Study. A noise study, if requested by the city and the proposal is in or within two hundred feet of residentially zoned property or in the downtown area for the proposed WCF and all associated equipment. 
e.  Additional Information Required. Applicants for a conditional use permit for a macrocell tower shall also submit the following information: 
i.  A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type, height and width of the proposed tower, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses and zoning (including when adjacent to other municipalities or the county), separation distances, adjacent roadways, photo simulations, a depiction of all proposed transmission equipment, proposed means of access, setbacks from property lines, elevation drawings or renderings of the proposed tower and any other structures, topography, parking, utility runs and other information deemed by the community development department to be necessary to assess compliance with this section. 
ii.  Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if applicable). 
iii.  The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest residential unit and the nearest residentially zoned property. 
iv.  The separation distance from other towers described in the inventory of existing sites shall be shown on an updated site plan or map. The applicant shall also identify the type of construction of the existing tower(s) and the owner/operator of the existing tower(s), if known. 
v.  Method of fencing, and finished color and, if applicable, the method of camouflage and illumination. 
vi.  A description of compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. 
vii.  Identification of the entities providing the backhaul network for the tower(s) described in the application and other cellular sites owned or operated by the applicant in the municipality.

17.12.240 - Conditional use permits, petition procedure and hearing procedure. 
A.  No premises shall be used or building or structure constructed within any zoning district as a conditional use until the owner has obtained a conditional use permit from the commission as provided herein, and executed a conditional use agreement. Once issued, a conditional use permit follows the land, and the conditional use agreement is binding upon subsequent owners. 
B.  At the time application for a conditional use is submitted to the planning office, a uniform fee established by council resolution shall be paid by the applicants. 
C.  The commission shall have the authority to grant conditional use permits, for conditional uses which are allowed in all zoning districts, to the owners or tenants, upon written approval of owner of the real property for which the conditional use is applied for. The council shall have the authority to grant conditional use permits, for conditional uses which are allowed in all zoning districts, when such conditional uses are proposed in connection with a zone change or annexation of new territory to the city. The commission shall have no authority to change, in any manner, a conditional use approved by the council, unless the council specifies that the commission shall have the authority to do so, in which case such fact shall be entered upon the conditional use permit. 
D.  Upon receipt of a complying application, thirty days in advance of the date of public hearing, for a conditional use on a site that is less than three acres in area, a written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be mailed, or delivered to the applicant and all owners of private real property within a three-hundred-foot radius of the perimeter of the property in question, as shown on the application. Notice shall be published at least fifteen calendar days prior to the hearing as required by law. 
E.  The commission shall proceed with the public hearing on the application in a manner prescribed above, and following the hearing and upon affirmative vote of a majority of all the members of the commission, the commission shall grant the conditional use and direct that permit to be issued under such terms and conditions as determined by the commission. 
F.  In the event a conditional use is proposed in connection with a petition for a zone change or newly annexed territory, the application for the conditional use shall accompany the petition. In the event the petition for zone change or annexation is required to be considered by the commission prior to council consideration, the commission may consider the same criteria and may recommend reasonable conditions be attached to any recommended approval. The council may review the commission's findings and issue its decision as set forth in Sections 17.12.240(G), 17.12.240(H) and 17.12.240(I) of this title. 
G.  No conditional use permit shall be granted unless the commission finds: 
1.  The conditional use is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this title; will not substantially impair the appropriate use of neighboring property; and will serve the public need, convenience, and welfare; 
2.  The conditional use is designed to be compatible with adjacent land uses and the area of its location. 
H.  In making its findings, the commission shall consider any relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following, if applicable to the proposed use: 
1.  Area and height to be occupied by buildings or other structures; 
2.  Density for the proposed use in terms of units per acre and the number of offices, employees, occupants, or all three; 
3.  Volume of business in terms of the number of customers per day; 
4.  Increased traffic congestion or hazard caused by the use which may be over and above normal traffic for the area, as determined by the city engineer and planning director; 
5.  Location of use with respect to the same or similar uses within a three hundred foot radius of the perimeter of the described property; 
6.  Any other criteria affecting public health, safety, and welfare, as provided for by written rules of the commission. 
I.  The commission or council may approve or deny any application for a conditional use permit. If the conditional use permit is approved, reasonable conditions or modifications may be imposed including, but not limited to, time limitations, requirements that one or more things be done before construction be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. By way of illustration, not limitation, the following may be considered and limitations or modifications may be placed upon the same, to the extent that such modifications or conditions are necessary to insure compliance with the criteria of Section 17.12.240(G) and (H) of this title: 
1.  Size and location of site; 
2.  Street and road capacities in the area; 
3.  Ingress and egress to adjoining public streets; 
4.  Location and amount of off-street parking; 
5.  Internal traffic circulation systems; 
6.  Fencing, screening, and landscaped separations; 
7.  Building bulk and location; 
8.  Usable open space; 
9.  Signs and lighting; and 
10.  Noise, vibration, air pollution and other environmental influences. 
    Any such condition shall be entered in the minutes of the appropriate issuing body and on the conditional use permit. The permit shall be issued and signed by the chairman and secretary of the commission, in the event the permit is issued by the commission. In any case in which a conditional use permit has not been exercised and the work completed by the person named in the permit, within one year from the date of issuance, such permit shall be void and have no further force or effect. 
J.  Upon the performance of all the conditions set forth in the conditional use permit and the continued performance if the conditions are of a continuing nature, the use shall be considered to be a permitted use. No conditional use may be modified, structurally enlarged, or expanded in ground area, unless such is allowed by the terms of the permit until and unless the conditional use permit is amended and approved in accordance with this title. In the event the city manager finds that any of the conditions of a permit have not been met, the permit may be revoked by the city manager, or the city may resort to any other remedy allowed at law for violations of this title. Appeals of the decision of the city manager to revoke, allow, or take no action on a permit shall be taken as set forth in this title. 
K.  All applications for conditional uses shall be on a form prescribed by the commission and shall, at the minimum, contain the following information: 
1.  Name and address of the person applying for the permit; 
2.  Legal description of property proposed for use; also common street address of property; 
3.  Total lot size of area proposed for use, including number of lots applicable; 
4.  Current zoning and use of property; 
5.  Current zoning and land uses within a three hundred foot radius of the property; 
6.  Purpose for which the property is to be used, including the size of the building or buildings, number of occupants and/or employees, and number of office spaces; 
7.  A plot plan of the property showing the proposed location of buildings, off-street parking spaces, routes for ingress and egress, and fencing and screening, if any; 
8.  Any restrictions on use of the property required by the council, whether required of the applicant or his predecessors in interest, including restrictions or requirements made by way of city-owner subdivision agreements. 
L.  Any person aggrieved or adversely affected by a final decision of the commission may appeal the decision to the city council by submitting a written request for a hearing, within ten calendar days from the date of the written decision. The city council shall establish a public hearing date to review all pertinent information concerning the proposed change, upon receipt of such appeal. In the event no appeal to the city council is taken within the specified time period, the action of the commission shall be final and conclusive. 
    The applicant and those favoring the application shall be allowed to speak first and present any information, including information presented at the commission, to council. Any opponents shall then be allowed to speak and present information, including information presented at the commission, to council. 
    The application and any exhibits presented at the commission shall be forwarded to council for their consideration at the public hearing. Any staff reports, findings, conclusions and orders of the commission shall be presented to council. 
    Council shall have the opportunity to question any speaker or ask any speaker to answer or respond to questions posed by other speakers or by council. 
    Council's decision shall be final. 
M.  Day-Care Conditional Use Permit Application.

Chapter 17.13 - MICRO WIND SYSTEMS AND SMALL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS 

17.13.010 - Definitions. 
    "A-Weighted Sound Level (dbA)" means a measurement of sound pressure level, which has been filtered or weighted to progressively de-emphasize the importance of frequency components below one thousand Hz and above five thousand Hz. This reflects the fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low frequencies and at extremely high frequencies, relative to the mid-range of the frequency spectrum. This area of sensitivity also corresponds to the human speech band. 
    "Decibel (db)" means the measurement of a sound pressure relative to the logarithmic conversion of the sound pressure reference level often set as zero db (A-weighted). In general, this means the quietest sound we can hear is near zero db (A-weighted) and the loudest we can hear without pain is near one hundred twenty db (A-weighted). 
    "FAA" means the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation. 
    "Guy cable" means any cable or wire that extends from a small wind energy system for the purpose of supporting the system structure. 
    "Meteorological tower" means a facility consisting of a tower and related wind-measuring devices, which is used solely to measure winds preliminary to construction of a small wind energy conversion system. Meteorological towers shall not be allowed for time periods in excess of twelve months, and shall be removed prior to the installation of the wind energy conversion system for which they are measuring. A request to install a meteorological tower shall be included in the application to install either a micro wind system or a small wind energy conversion system. 
    "Micro wind system" means a building-mounted wind system (either a vertical or horizontal axis turbine) that has a rated nameplate capacity of ten kW or less, (three kW or less for residential properties), and projects no more than fifteen feet) above the highest point of the roof. Such building-mounted wind systems shall be regulated by applicable building and electrical codes, and shall not be considered a small wind energy conversion system. A micro wind system shall not be considered in determining total building height for zoning or setback purposes. Multiple turbines are permitted, provided the total cumulative rated nameplate capacity does not exceed ten kW (or three kW for residential properties). 
    "Rated nameplate capacity" means the maximum rated output of electric power production equipment. This output is typically specified by the manufactured with a "nameplate" on the equipment. 
    "Small wind energy conversion system" means a wind energy conversion system consisting of a tower, a turbine, and associated control or conversion electronics that generates power for an individual property for the purpose of reducing on-site energy consumption with a rated nameplate capacity of twenty-five kW or less per tower. This includes, but is not limited to, storage, electrical collection and supply equipment, and transformers. Excess electrical power generated, and not presently needed for on site use, may be utilized by the utility company. 
    "Tower height" means the total height above finished grade of the fixed portion of the tower, including the wind turbine blades. 
    "Turbine" means the parts of a wind system including the blades, generator and tail. The definition of a turbine includes both horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT).

7.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. 21-04 § 1 (part), 2004) 
17.20.020 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 21-04 § 1 (part), 2004) 
17.20.030 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Alluvial fan flooding" means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows, active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition, and unpredictable flow paths. 
    "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    "Development" means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Elevated building" means a non-basement building: (1) built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and (2) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones Al -30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of zones Vl-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    "Existing construction" means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map" (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the special flood hazards areas (SFHAs), the base flood elevations (BFEs), and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map. 
    "Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain Management Regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    "Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or unproved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    "Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out m close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is:

3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood insurance Program regulations. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) OF 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    "New construction" means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulation adopted by a community. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the larges horizontal projections; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.

For the purpose of determining community rating system (CRS) premium discounts, all AR and A99 zones are treated as non-SFHAS. 
    "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings such as garages or shed not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

17.20.080 - Variance procedures. 
A.  The Casper planning and zoning commission, hereinafter referred to as commission, shall hear and render judgement on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The commission shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Any such appeal shall be filed within thirty days of any such decision by the floodplain administrator, with notice of such appeal being filed with the Casper community development department. 
C.  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the commission may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
D.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
E.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 17.20.070(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of Section 17.20.010. 
H.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
I.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
J.  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
1.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
2.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance a would result in an undue hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
3.  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
K.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
1.  The criteria outlined in Section 17.20.080 (A through I) are met; and 
2.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

1.  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated no less than one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 17.20.070(A)(1), is satisfied. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated no less than one foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
3.  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
4.  Manufactured Homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on the community's FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no less than one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones Al-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of Section 17.20.100(A)(4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
(1)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is no less than one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
(2)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
5.  Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

(Ord. No. 4-15, § 7, 5-5-2015) 
17.20.110 - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
A.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with Sections 17.20.010 and 17.20.020 of this chapter. 
B.  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of Sections 17.20.040(C), 17.20.070; and the provisions of Sections 17.20.090 through 17.20.130. 
C.  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 17.20.040(B) or Section l7.20.060(A)(8) of this chapter. 
D.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
E.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. 21-04 § 1 (part), 2004) 
17.20.120 - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
A.  Located within the SFHAS established in Section 17.20.040(B), are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified); 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy; 
3.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 17.20.070(A)(l), are satisfied; 
4.  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 21-04 § 1 (part), 2004) 
(Ord. No. 4-15, § 8, 5-5-2015) 
17.20.130 - Floodways. 
A.  Floodways located within SFHAS established in Section 17.20.040(B), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
2.  If Section 17.20.130(A)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 17.20.090 through 17.20.130;

Chapter 17.94 - OLD YELLOWSTONE DISTRICT AND SOUTH POPLAR STREET CORRIDOR FORM-BASED CODE 

17.94.010 - Purpose, intent and using the code. 
    The Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor form-based code regulating plan is intended to integrate urban design, building form, placement, use and design as a means for implementing the West Central and South Poplar Street Corridor Plan, dated September, 2007, as may be amended from time to time. 
    This form-based code is also intended to encourage land uses that promote vibrant commerce, social interaction, and a wide variety of housing types, where people can live, work, shop and play, all within proximity and walking distance. 
    The intended goal of the form-based code is to create a complimentary extension of the downtown, with its own unique character and design, and to provide a framework for achieving the desired built-form characteristics of a downtown, including similar densities, building materials, building orientation, building heights, architecture and a diversified mix of complimentary and interrelated land uses. 
    The form-based code consists of a regulating plan, building envelope standards and design standards. 
    The code is comprised of five interrelated elements. 
1.  Zoning district narrative describing purpose, intent, applicability and design. 
2.  A regulating plan that describes the areas within the development project where specified building types may be located. 
3.  Building envelope and street standards that describe the allowable height, disposition and use for the specified building types and right-of-way, travel lane, center median, parking, terrace and/or sidewalk and alleyway width for the specified thoroughfares. 
4.  Design standards for guiding specific aspects of building and site design. 
5.  The regulating plan and building envelope and street standards apply to new facilities such as buildings, streets, parking lots, etc. The design standards apply to existing and new facilities. 
A.  Design Principles. The code is based on several fundamental design principles: 
1.  Mixing of uses vertically within structures and horizontally upon sites allows for greater market flexibility, sharing of support facilities such as parking, reducing the necessity for short vehicle trips while promoting walking and biking and leading to a more sustainable city. 
2.  Buildings should be placed close to the sidewalk and street to better define and enliven the public realm and economize resources such as land and utilities. 
3.  Building types that support multiple uses and are flexible or adaptable over time are preferable to highly specific, single-use typologies that may more easily become obsolete. 
4.  Increased density helps afford increased private and public realm amenities such as brick and stone building exteriors and streetscaping. 
5.  A more enhanced public realm with interconnected sidewalks, plazas, landscaped parkways and trails promotes and support social interaction and healthier living. 
B.  Using the Regulating Plan. The regulating plan illustrates the proposed street and block layout for the Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor and specifies new structures by building type permitted on each block. The plan includes a typical representative photograph of each specific building type, along with a corresponding legend indicating which building types are permitted in each of the four specified zones. Persons wishing to develop new facilities within the project area should refer to the regulating plan as the first step towards preparing a proposed building and site design for a specific block of blocks. (Figure 1 represents the process for using the regulating plan.) 
Figure 1. Steps to Using the Form-Based Code Process 

C.  Architectural Review Committee. Each submittal under the form-based code shall be reviewed and approved by an architectural review committee appointed by the city council.

17.94.130 - Design standards. 
A.  Purpose. These standards have five primary functions: 
1.  To support the form-based zoning by providing additional design direction; 
2.  To direct developers or business owners wishing to propose expansions, renovations or new construction of buildings or parking within the project area; 
3.  To assist city staff and city officials in reviewing development proposals; 
4.  To support the goals, policies, land use and transportation plans crafted as part of the Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor; and 
5.  To create durable, high quality development, including office, retail and life cycle housing for a range of income levels. 
B.  Application. The design standards for the Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor shall apply to the following activities on all types of institutional, commercial, mixed use and residential facilities: 
1.  New building construction; 
2.  Exterior remodeling affecting more than fifty percent of street facing facades or additions of over fifty percent of the existing floor area, not including routine maintenance, such as repainting or roof repairs within a single one-year timeframe; 
3.  Interior remodeling over fifty percent of existing structure floor area and affecting existing doors and fenestration within a single one-year timeframe; 
4.  New surface parking of more than four spaces or expansion of existing parking lot totaling more than four parking spaces; 
5.  New signs must comply with sign regulations herein. 
C.  Design Review. Project sponsor (developer or owner) shall meet with the community development director to discuss the proposed project prior to making a formal submittal for approval. Accepted submittals will be reviewed by the city for compliance with these design standards as a part of the site plan review process. 
D.  Relief. 
1.  Relief from a specific building-material-related design requirement may be granted by the Architectural Review Committee on an individual basis for new or different construction materials not permitted or addressed by these design standards if the applicant demonstrates that such building materials meet the design objectives of the Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor Form-Based Code. Approval of alternate building materials by the Architectural Review Committee shall include findings supporting the approval and shall be based on compliance with one or more specific objectives or goals of the Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor Form-Based Code. 
2.  If an applicant requests relief, and after the Architectural Review Committee has made its findings, is aggrieved by the decision of the Architectural Review Committee, said applicant may appeal the Committee's decision pursuant to Section 17.94,020. 
E.  Reference and Precedence. These design standards have been coordinated with information established in the city of Casper Design Standards for Commercial Downtown Streetscape and Parks dated September 2005. Additional guidance on aspects of these site development standards such as public streetscape, parking lot, bikeway and park facility design can be obtained from consulting the city of Casper Design Standards for Commercial/Downtown Streetscape and Parks (Chapter 16.17 of this code). In the event of discrepancies between the two documents, the West Central and South Poplar Street Corridor Plan, dated September, 2007, as may be amended from time to time, design standards shall take precedence. 
BUILT FORM STANDARDS 
Building Placement 
    OBJECTIVE: To maintain and reinforce a recognizable, consistent street edge. 
    Buildings shall have a well-defined front facade with primary entrances facing the street. Buildings shall be aligned so that the dominant lines of their facades parallel the line of the street and create a well-defined street edge. 
    Placement shall meet the established building setback as defined in the building envelope standards for the specified building type as located on the regulating plan. In addition, portions of the facade may be set back up to five additional feet beyond the allowable maximum set back to emphasize entries, provide increased space for plantings or to create areas for outdoor dining and gathering. 
    Placement of the main level of residential buildings eighteen to twenty-four inches above the elevation of the front sidewalk is encouraged to provide greater separation and security. Additional side or rear entries shall meet grade and shall serve as the "accessible" entrance. 
    At intersections, buildings should "hold the corner" - that is, have street facades at or near the sidewalk on both streets. 

Place building entrances facing the primary street. 

Entry recessed to provide area for outdoor dining. 

Example of building properly set to the corner. 
BUILT FORM STANDARDS 
Facades 
    OBJECTIVE: To employ visually legible building proportions that support pedestrian interaction, are scaled to provide a distinct first story, define the street edge and provide visual continuity. 
    In general, buildings over two stories shall have a well-defined base, middle and top. The base, or ground floor, shall appear visually distinct from upper stories, through the use of a change in building materials, window shape or size, an intermediate cornice line, an awning, arcade or portico, or similar techniques. 
    It shall be recognized that buildings will be viewed from a variety of vantage points. Consequently, the placement of doors, windows, balconies, changes in materials or roof height, etc. shall be designed to provide an attractive and harmonious design from the front, side, rear and top. 
    Building tops shall be articulated with discernible cornice lines, parapets and/or fascias. 

Buildings with recognizable layers - base, middle and top 
BUILT FORM STANDARDS 
Building Width and Facade Articulation 
    OBJECTIVE: To add visual interest and variety by avoiding long, monotonous facades. 
    New building facades, including parking garages, shall have a pedestrian scale aesthetic. This can be accomplished by establishing a layering of rhythmic patterns and architectural elements such as windows, columns, roof lines, building materials and colors. 
    "Flat" facades shall be avoided; historic structures exhibit more of the desired play of light and shadow on a building; new development shall create more of a visual impact in ways similar to that of historic structures. 
    The primary facade(s) (viewable by the public from streets and parking lots) of all buildings shall be articulated into distinct increments through the following or similar techniques: 
Stepping back or extending forward a portion of the facade 
Use of different textures or contrasting, but compatible, materials 
Division into storefronts with separate display windows and entrances 
Arcades, awnings, window bays, balconies or similar ornamental features 
Variation in roof lines to reinforce the articulation of the primary facade 

Changes in material and color, along with multiple entrances, break this block-long facade into smaller, more human scale increments. 
  

Well proportioned, rhythmic facade using uniform exterior building material (painted concrete). 
  

Facades divided into smaller, human scale increments that also reflect the building's interior organization and ownership pattern. 
BUILT FORM STANDARDS

    The base of the sign shall include a minimum of one hundred eighty square feet of irrigated landscaping that spans the entire width of the sign structure. Acceptable landscape materials are in the appendix of the Old Yellowstone District and South Poplar Street Corridor Form-Based Code. 
SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Fences and Screen Walls 
    OBJECTIVE: To provide exterior enclosures or barriers that harmonize with the architectural design of their associated facilities, and enhance the aesthetics of surrounding environment. 
    Frontages 
    Decorative fencing or screen walls for entry courtyards or outdoor seating areas located between buildings and the primary street frontage, to include corner lots, shall not exceed forty-eight inches in height, be at least sixty percent transparent and be limited to the following materials: 
     Painted or sealed architectural metals such as wrought iron pickets or rails, cast or cut, and patterned screens supported by appropriately-sized structural systems. 
     Stone and/or brick veneer wall systems supported by appropriately-sized structural backup walls and subsurface foundations. 
     Wood, chain link, plastic, vinyl fiberglass pickets and/or corrugated metal panels are prohibited as a dominant material, but combinations of these materials, with the exception of chain link, may be allowed as long as they meet the site development standards identified in the Form Based Code and comprise not more than forty percent, in total, of the face area of the fence 
    Side, Rear Yards, and Rear Yards on Alley or on Through Lots 
    Fencing and screen walls for enclosing side yards, back patios or rear courtyards, or patios or yards on through lots, may be opaque and shall not exceed eight feet in height. The meaning of "through lots" in the Form Based Code has the same definition as in Section 17.08.010 of the Casper Municipal Code. Fences that are greater than six feet in height require a building permit. Fences shall be limited to the following materials: 
     Same materials as for frontages but also including painted wood or stained wood. 
    Fences made solely of wood, chain link, plastic, vinyl fiberglass pickets, and/or corrugated metal panel are prohibited; but, combinations of these materials, with the exception of chain link, may be allowed as long as they meet the site development standards identified in the Form Based Code and comprise no more than forty percent, in total, of the face area of the fence. 
     Where fences and screen walls, located at the rear entry, are over six feet in height, the fence or screen wall must be designed into distinct increments through the following or a combination of or similar techniques: 
    ;circle; Variation of fence or screen wall setback. 
    ;circle; Using different textures or contrasting, but compatible, materials. 
    ;circle; Incorporation of bases of contrasting, but compatible materials and/or planters and/or plant alcoves which shall receive irrigated landscaping materials. 
    ;circle; Variations in the height (to allowable limits) and/or material of the fence so as to include and/or feature landscaping elements such as, but not limited to, earth berms, garden structures, gates, pergolas, or other appropriate elements of interest. Incorporating landscaping features into the fence or screen wall. 
    ;circle; Variations in the transparency of the fence through the use of arcades, awnings, openings, windows or window bays, ledges, trellises or other ornamental features. 
    ;circle; Varying the top line of the fence or screen wall to reinforce the articulation of the primary building facade. 
    ;circle; A setback of at least five feet from the sidewalk, buffered with landscaping in accordance with the design standards outlined in the Form Based Code. 
    Parking Lots 
    Parking lot screen walls and fences shall be no less than two feet, and no more than three feet, in height to allow views into and out of the parking area. 
    All fencing projects must first complete the fence or building permit application available in the community development department, and then arrange for a review and approval of the fencing project by the architectural review committee. 


Use of architectural metals for entry courtyards or primary street frontages. 

Variation of fence or screen wall setback. 

Using different textures or contrasting, but complimentary, materials and variation in transparency. 

Use of windows and/or openings. 

Use of landscaping and varying materials.

Appendix 
Illuminance Requirements for Parking Lots 
    These requirements include exterior lighting practices for the reasonably safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in parking facilities, the enhancing of personal security and the deterring of vandalism, while conserving energy and minimizing maintenance. They provide minimum guidelines, but are subject to variations based upon sound engineering judgment. Retailers, especially big-box stores, usually prefer higher levels of illuminance than specified herein, to attract customers or to more strongly address perceptions of personal security needs. 
    Generally speaking, parking lots and parking structures have vehicular speeds that are much lower than roadways. More importantly, the primary purpose of the lighting here is to benefit the pedestrian. It is intended that a driver (or pedestrian) looking at the brightest spot in the field of view will also be able to detect an object in the dark areas within the field of view. This detection can only occur if the maximum-to-minimum illuminance is limited to a range that the human eye can see. 
Table 1: Recommended Maintained Illuminance Values for Parking Lots 
Basic 1 Enhanced Security 2 Minimum Horizontal Illuminance 3 lux 4 2 5 fc 2 0.2 0.5 Uniformity Ratio, Maximum to Minimum 6 20:1 15:1 Minimum Vertical Illuminance 7 Lux 8 1 2.5 fc 5 0.1 0.25  
1 For typical conditions. During periods of non-use, the illuminance of certain parking facilities may be turned off of reduced to conserve energy. If reduced lighting is to be used only for the purpose of property security, it is desirable that the minimum (low point) value not be less than 1.0 horizontal lux (0.1 hfc). Reductions should not be applied to facilities subject to intermittent night use, such as at apartments, hospitals, and transportation terminals. 
2 If personal security or vandalism is a likely and/or severe problem, a significant increase of the Basic level may be appropriate. Many retailers prefer even higher levels, with a specification of 10 lux (1 fc) as the minimum value. 
3 For preliminary design, an average value of 10 horizontal lux (1 hfc) for Basic, or 25 horizontal lux (2.5 hfc) for enhanced illuminance may be calculated. The minimum points (or areas) and maximum point are then calculated and the uniformity ratio checked for compliance with the Table 1 values. Note: The 5:1 average-to-minimum ratio is the first step toward directing the design to achieve the maximum to minimum ratios presented in Table 1. 
4 Measured on the parking surface, without any shadowing effect from parked vehicles or trees at points of measurement. 
5 Rounded conversion of lux to foot candles. 
6 The highest horizontal illuminance point divided by the lowest horizontal illuminance point or area should not be greater than the values shown. 
7 Facial recognition can be made at levels a low as 2.5 lux (0.25 fc). The TESNA Security Lighting Committee recommends that for facial identification, the minimum vertical illuminance should be 5.0 lux (0.5 fc). 
8 Measured at 1.5 meters (5.0 ft.) above parking surface at the point of lowest horizontal illuminance, excluding facing outward along boundaries. 
    Basic lighting requirements tend to be similar for most land uses. Typical or average security needs are equally as great in a parking lot serving an apartment building or a regional shopping center. In fact, the higher the pedestrian activity level, the lower the likely security problem. However, greater pedestrian activity usually equates to greater conflict with vehicles. Because these conditions tend to counterbalance, no difference in the basic level of illuminance appears warranted among various land uses. However, customer attraction can be a reason to provide illuminance higher than the basic illuminance level given in Table 1. When higher light levels are used, retailers should give careful consideration to the safety consequences of drivers exiting the parking facility directly onto adjacent streets with lower lighting levels.

17.96.050 - Off-premises signs. 
A.  Purpose and Scope. It is the purpose of this section to establish reasonable regulations to reduce visual clutter, protect the view of the skyline, reduce distractions for motorists, and reduce conflicts with traffic control signs and devices from signs that do not identify the principal goods of services offered on the lot or parcel upon which the sign is located. Except as otherwise provided, this section shall govern and control all aspects relating to, and including, the erection, remodeling, enlarging, moving, operation, and maintenance of all outdoor general advertising devices (hereafter called off-premises signs). 
B.  Permits. Off-premises signs shall not be erected or structurally altered, beyond the removal and replacement of the sign face, unless a permit for that purpose has been obtained from the city. Signs that do not comply with this code, and are thereby nonconforming, may be replaced only if a new sign or structure is erected within fifty feet of the original sign's location, within three hundred sixty-five days of the date of removal of the original sign. In such case, the new sign shall be considered a legal nonconforming use. 
C.  Zoning Districts. Permitted off-premises signs may be erected or located in highway business (C-4), limited industrial (M-1) and general industrial (M-2) zoning districts. Permitted off-premises signs may be erected or located within general business (C-2) districts with approval of the planning and zoning commission as a conditional use. In addition to the conditional use findings set forth in Section 17.12.240(G) and pursuant to the review criteria stated in Section 17.12.240(H) of this code, the planning and zoning commission may consider lighting, impacts on neighboring properties and the relationship of the proposed sign to existing on-premises signs in making their determination on the request. 
D.  Freestanding, wall, roof, portable, and bench signs will be permitted. 
E.  Permitted Number of Signs. Only one off-premises sign structure shall be permitted on a single lot; however, two sign faces may be placed in one location on one structure. Upon the removal of one or more sign faces, not more than two sign faces may be replaced on, or may remain on the sign structure. 
F.  Maximum Area and Size. The sign face area of any off-premises sign shall not exceed two hundred fifty square feet when located adjacent to an arterial or collector street as defined in the Casper Area Urban Roadway Functional Classification Map as adopted by the Wyoming Department of Transportation, or five hundred square feet when located adjacent to Interstate 25. 
G.  Maximum Height. Unless otherwise provided, no off-premises sign shall exceed fifty feet in height above the edge of the pavement of the adjoining street. 
H.  Sign Back to be Finished. The back side of an off-premises sign shall be finished or painted, if the back side is visible to public view from a street or from any adjacent residential or commercially zoned lot. 
I.  Spacing Requirements. 
1.  Arterial Street and Collector Streets. Off-premises signs erected along arterial streets, and collector streets as identified in Casper Area Urban Roadway Functional Classification Map as adopted by the Wyoming Department of Transportation, shall conform to the following spacing requirements: 
a.  Spacing between sign structures or permitted sign locations shall be a minimum of five hundred feet apart, when the signs are intended to serve Interstate 25 motorists. Signs erected or locations permitted along all other arterial or collector streets shall be a minimum of three hundred feet apart.

3.  Location and width of all interior and abutting roads, highways, rights-of-way and railroad rights-of-way; 
4.  Easements on the land under consideration; 
5.  Adjoining property lines; 
6.  The location, type, and size of all existing plant materials, specifying whether the materials are to remain on the site;

8.  A written statement specifying the percentage of total landscaped area that is dedicated to both irrigated, organic landscaping, and inorganic, non-irrigated landscaping materials; and 
9.  All other significant features. 
P.  All landscaping shall consist of a variety of species to enhance biodiversity. The use of water-efficient landscape materials and design (xeriscaping) is encouraged. 
Q.  Since trees are beneficial to the city of Casper for multiple reasons, including the mitigation of the "heat island effect," trees are a strongly encouraged component of every landscape plan. Furthermore, applicants shall, as a priority, take reasonable precautions to protect and retain existing trees on development sites. Applicants will be given credit for the mature canopy area of both existing and proposed trees toward the city's minimum landscaping percentage requirements. 
(Ord. No. 7-10, § 5, 4-6-2010) 
Exemptions. 
A.  The community development director may permit an exemption from installing landscaping on a site if any one of the following criteria is met: 
1.  If the development is located in the C-3 (Central Business) zoning district, and the existing or proposed development pattern precludes the installation of landscaping on-site; 
2.  If the development site does not have public water service; or 
3.  If the development site lacks adequate or practical space for landscaping. 
B.  If an applicant meets any one of the three criteria for landscaping exemptions, and upon written approval of the community development director, applicant shall, prior to the issuance of a building permit, pay the city a fee in lieu of providing landscaping on site. The "in-lieu-of fee" can be applied to offset either all, or a portion of, the entire landscaping requirement. All "in-lieu-of fees" collected by the city shall be utilized for costs associated with installing landscaping on publicly controlled property, such as parks, trails, intersections, or street rights-of-way. The amount of the "in-lieu-of fee" for landscaping shall be determined as follows: 
Commercial: 8% of the (building permit) valuation of the structure(s) 
Industrial: 5% of the (building permit) valuation of the structure(s) 
Multi-family residential: 7% of (building permit) valuation of the structure(s) 
(Ord. No. 7-10, § 6, 4-6-2010) 
Performance Security. 
A.  All on-site landscaping shall be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, If the landscaping cannot be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the property owner may request, in writing, an extension not exceeding six months. If the request demonstrates that as a result of conditions beyond the control of the applicant the landscaping cannot be completed, the community development director is authorized to grant the owner's request for an extension. Once an extension is granted, the building official may issue a certificate of occupancy for the structure. 
B.  In the case of an extension granted by the community development director for the installation of landscaping, the owner is required to post, with the city, a performance security in the form of a bond, cash, letter of credit, or other form acceptable to the city. The posted amount shall be in an amount of no less than one hundred twenty-five percent of an itemized estimate prepared by a landscape architect or professional landscaping contractor, for all landscaping material and installation costs necessary to comply with the approved landscaping plan. The community development director shall have the discretion to determine if the amount of the itemized estimate is reasonable, and may request subsequent written estimates to verify the accuracy and validity of the original estimate. 
C.  In the case of an extension granted by the community development director for the installation of landscaping, the performance security shall be submitted to the city and accepted by the community development director prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
D.  In the case of an extension granted by the community development director for the installation of landscaping, all landscaping shall be completed within six months of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If said landscaping is not completed within six months, and/or is not in substantial compliance with the approved landscaping plan, the performance security shall be subject to forfeiture to the city. The city shall have the right to utilize the forfeited funds to install and/or replace the required landscaping. 
E.  If the owner is granted an extension by the community development director for the installation of landscaping, the owner shall, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, grant the city express written permission to enter upon the site to cause the installation of required landscaping if said landscaping has not been completed within six months of the effective date of the certificate of occupancy, and/or if said landscaping is not in substantial compliance with the approved landscaping plan. 
F.  The owner shall notify the community development director, in writing, upon completion of the required landscaping. Once the installed landscaping is determined to be acceptable by the community development director, and a letter of completion is issued, the city shall release the applicant's surety.

Appendix C - BUFFERING 
Goal. 
    To encourage the most appropriate use of land and conserve and protect the privacy and value of adjacent uses. 
Objectives. 
    The buffering alternatives are designed to meet the following objectives: 
A.  To provide a smooth transition between adjoining properties; 
B.  To encourage developments compatible with existing developments; 
C.  To mitigate existing or potential conflicts between differing land uses. 
Definition. 
    Buffering means the use of specific measures including screening, which are designed to separate and protect differing land uses. 
Procedures. 
    Buffering is required by Section 17.12.130 of this title for all multifamily dwellings adjacent to single-family dwellings and for all PUD, commercial, industrial and multifamily developments adjacent to residential developments. Plans detailing buffering measures shall be included in the site plan application which shall be filed and processed according to the provisions of Appendix A of this title. Compliance with approved buffering measures shall be enforced by the enforcement officer. 
Buffering Alternatives. 
    Recognizing that the amount and type of buffering necessary varies with each particular situation, the following alternative measures are designed to provide the flexibility necessary for the maximum mitigation of conflicts between differing land uses: 
A.  Screening shall be required between the differing land uses as specified above and shall consist of one of the following: 
1.  Screening Alternate 1: Consists of a six-foot solid wood fence or a masonry or concrete wall. Ten percent of the total screening surface may be composed of (a) openings, each having a maximum area of twenty-four square inches, or (b) materials other than masonry or concrete which may contain openings having a maximum dimension of nine inches in width or height; 
2.  Screening Alternate 2: Consists of a hedgerow of various evergreen shrubs which will normally grow to a height required to adequately buffer developments. All plants should have a minimum height at the time of planting of one-half of the required screening height; 
3.  Screening Alternate 3: Consists of a six-foot solid wood fence or a concrete or masonry wall as specified in Screening Alternate 1, and evergreen trees. Such trees should be a minimum of two inches in trunk diameter, at least five to six feet in height and planted ten to twelve feet on center; 
4.  Screening Alternate 4: Consists of landscaped earthen berms of a minimum height as needed to buffer developments. Side slopes of berms should have a minimum of four feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of height. Berms should contain necessary drainage provisions as required by the city; 
5.  Screening Alternate 5: Consists of large deciduous or coniferous trees. Such trees should be a minimum of two inches in trunk diameter, fifteen feet in height, and planted fifteen to twenty feet on center; 
6.  Screening Alternate 6: Consists of any combination of Alternates 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 so as to provide screening adequate to buffer developments. 
B.  In considering approval of a site plan, assessment of the amount of screening required will be based upon the treatment of height, bulk, and density at the edge of the proposed development. The following criteria should be considered in site design: 
1.  Open Space Setbacks. By providing an open space buffer between conflicting land uses, conflicts can often be avoided. The width of the buffer required will depend on the extent of other measures applied. To work effectively, the purpose, use and maintenance of the open space buffer must be clearly defined. 
2.  Orientation. The strict spatial proximity between land uses and the apparent or functional proximity can be very different, depending on the orientation of buildings and activities in the two land uses. 
    The buildings can create an effective buffer if constructed back-to-back, thus orienting views, access, and principal activities away from the other land use. However, a hazardous and unaesthetic "no man's land" must not be created in the process. Some appropriate use must be given to the intervening space. 
    Alternately, the intervening space can be eliminated altogether if the two buildings share a common back wall. An entire site plan can be oriented so least compatible activities and functions are placed furthest from the common boundary between land uses, and those most compatible, near that boundary. 
3.  Architectural Compatibility. In addition to the architectural considerations involved in mitigation through orientation, the materials, colors, scale and prominence of buildings in adjacent land uses can be coordinated so there is a gradual transition from one land use to another, rather than a sharp and displeasing contrast. The architectural compatibility should rise from a total consideration of the function of each land use and the function of the space between them. 
4.  Circulation. Streets and parking areas can often serve to reduce certain types of land use conflicts. 
5.  One-to-One Ratio. Multifamily units constructed in the required setback can be only one story in height; for each additional ten feet of setback, units may be constructed of one additional story up to the maximum height requirements of a district. 
C.  Buffering shall not: 
1.  Interfere with the installation, maintenance and repair of any public utilities; 
2.  Restrict pedestrian or vehicular access; or 
3.  Constitute a traffic hazard. 
D.  Examples of buffering techniques are shown on the following pages.
