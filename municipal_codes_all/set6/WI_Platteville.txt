3.32 WORK RELIEF AND GENERAL RELIEF. (a) Statement of Policy. Whereas, it is
the declared legislative policy of the State of Wisconsin, as appears in Section 49.002,
CHAPTER 3 Administration
23 As of 7/31/19
Wisconsin Statutes, that refusal of a bona fide offer of employment or training without good
cause or acceptance and subsequent inadequate performance through willful neglect,
shall necessitate that local municipal or county welfare officials discontinue general relief
payments to such individual; and
Whereas, it is contemplated that certain dependent persons, as defined in Section 49.01,
Wisconsin Statutes, whose legal settlements are within the City of Platteville, will leave this
municipality and apply for General Assistance in other municipalities within the State of
Wisconsin; and
Whereas, certain of these individuals will leave this municipality for the express purpose of
avoiding the City’s Work Relief Program; and
Whereas, other counties and municipalities also maintain such programs and should place
such individuals on their programs in their respective municipalities in light of a disability to
force such persons to return to their municipalities of legal settlement,
Now therefore, the following programs and policies are adopted by the Common Council.
(b) Work Relief Program. The City shall maintain a continuing work relief program for
all eligible welfare recipients and hereby notifies all Wisconsin counties and,
through each County Clerk, each municipality of same.
(c) Notification. The City of Platteville hereby requests each county and/or municipality
to notify each recipient whose legal settlement is presumed to be within the City of
Platteville, of the work relief program within the City of Platteville.

pursuant to Section 49.11(4), Wisconsin Statutes, for recipients whose legal

relief program the recipient in question shall be certified for placement therein.
(e) Payment of Claims. The City of Platteville shall deny any claims submitted by a
county or municipality for general relief for any recipient who refuses to accept a
bona fide offer of employment from said county or municipality without good cause.
Documentation as to the recipient’s refusal shall be submitted to the City.

subsection does not apply to members of the Common Council.
(g) Access Procedures. 1. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the
legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the
requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record
CHAPTER 3 Administration
27 As of 7/31/19
without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by
the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally,
but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is
commenced under Section 19.37, Wisconsin Statutes. Except as provided below,
no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to
be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused
because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required
under subsection (f)(6)VI. A requester may be required to show acceptable
identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or
whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
2. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable
and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the
authority’s determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the
reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City
Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly
time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to
itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable
compliance.
3. A request for a record may be denied as provided in subsection (h). If a
request is made orally, the request may be denied orally or if a demand for a
written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the
requester within five business days of the oral denial, or if a written request
is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement
of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request
shall inform the requester that if request for the record was made in writing,
then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of
mandamus under Section 19.37(1), Wisconsin Statutes, or upon application
to the Attorney General or a District Attorney.
(h) Limitations on Right to Access. 1. As provided by Section 19.36, Wisconsin
Statutes, the following records are exempt from inspection under this section:
I. Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law
or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
II. Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law
enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption
from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to
receipt of aids by the state;
III. Computer programs, although the material used as input for a
computer program or the material produced as a product of the
computer program is subject to inspection; and
CHAPTER 3 Administration
28 As of 7/31/19
IV. A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying
as a common law trade secret.
2. As provided by Section 43.30, Wisconsin Statutes, public library circulation
records are exempt from inspection under this section.
3. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not
specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with
the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she
determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure
would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record.
Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are
not limited to, the following:
I. Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were
necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in
them.
II. Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.
III. Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal,
promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline or

7.02 WATER SYSTEM CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL. (a) Statement of Policy.
Whereas, it is the City of Platteville’s intent to provide a program for protecting the public
water system from contamination due to back flow of contaminants through the water
service connection into the public water system; and
Whereas, Chapters NR811 and Comm 82, Wisconsin Administrative Code, require
protection of the public water system from contaminants due to back flow of contaminants
through the water service connection; and
Whereas, the Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources and Commerce require the
maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically
and effectively prevent the contamination of all potable water systems;
Now, Therefore, the following are adopted by the Common Council.
(b) That a cross-connection shall be defined as any physical connection or
arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains
potable water from the City of Platteville water system, and the other, water from a
private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or
chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction
of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.
CHAPTER 7 Water Service
2
(c) That no person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be established or
maintain or permit to be maintained any cross-connection. No interconnection shall
be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water
supply other than the regular public water supply of the City of Platteville may enter
the supply or distribution system of said municipality, unless such private, auxiliary
or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply
shall have been approved by the Platteville Water & Sewer Commission and by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in accordance with Section NR811.09
Wisconsin Administrative Code.
(d) That it shall be the duty of the Platteville Water & Sewer Department to cause
inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water system where
cross-connections with the public water system is deemed possible. The frequency
of inspections and re-inspections based on potential health hazards involved shall
be as established by the Platteville Water & Sewer Commission and as approved
by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
(e) That upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the Platteville Water &
Sewer Department shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to
examine any property served by the connection to the public water system of the
City of Platteville for cross-connections. If entry is refused, such representative
shall obtain a special inspection warrant under Section 66.0119, Wisconsin
Statutes. Upon request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property so served
shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping
system or systems on such property.
(f) That the Platteville Water & Sewer Commission is hereby authorized and directed
to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of
this ordinance exists, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system.
Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for
hearing under Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, except as provided in subsection
(g). Water service to such property shall not be restored until the crossconnection(
s) has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this section.
(g) That if it is determined by the Platteville Water & Sewer Commission that a crossconnection
or an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and
requires immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk
of the City of Platteville and delivered to the customer’s premises, service may be
immediately discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for hearing
under Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, within 10 days of such emergency
discontinuance.

Commission shall have the authority to set a higher rate based on estimated
total usage and the metered rate schedule. Should the residential customer
request it, a water meter shall be installed and the customer shall be
charged on the same basis as commercial or industrial customers having
private water supplies.
(b) Minimum Charge: The “minimum” monthly wastewater service charge shall
be as ordered by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission and shall be
consistent with the Utility’s User Charge System as approved by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
(c) Volume Charge: In addition to the minimum charge, there shall be a charge
for all flow based on water usage as determined by the Water Utility. The
rate of volume charge shall be as ordered by the Wisconsin Public Service
Commission and shall be consistent with the Utility’s User Charge System
as approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
(d) Industrial and Commercial Charges for Other Than Normal Wastewater:
1. Charges for wastewater other than Normal Wastewater shall be
based on Flow, BOD, Suspended Solids, and such other constituents
which affect the cost of collection and treatment. Charges shall be
made in accordance with rates established as set forth in Section
1(2)(d)3 below.
2. All persons discharging wastes into the public sewers are subject to a
surcharge, in addition to any other wastewater service charge, if their
wastewater has a concentration greater than “normal” concentrations
(see definition). The volume of flow used for computing waste
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption, subject to
adjustments as otherwise herein provided, or the actual volume of
waste as determined by an industrial waste metering installation. The
amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the Utility in
removing BOD, Suspended Solids, and other pertinent constituents.
3. Rates of Surcharge. The rates of surcharge for each of the
aforementioned constituents shall be as ordered by the Wisconsin
Public Service Commission and shall be consistent with the Utility’s
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
7
User Charge System as approved by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources.
4. In addition to the above surcharges, the Utility’s costs of sampling
and analyzing industrial wastes shall be charged to the applicable
industry.
5. Where industrial wastes are of such a strength or magnitude or are
delivered over such a period of time that the above surcharges do not
reflect the actual cost of treatment to the Utility, the Utility shall have
the right to establish a special charge for handling the waste. That
portion of the charge related to capital investment shall be based on
the design capacity required for the particular waste. In no event
shall the charges be less than those charges determined by applying
the above surcharge.
(e) Industrial Waste Pretreatment: In the event the Utility provides pretreatment
of industrial wastes, the entire cost of such pretreatment shall be charged to
the person producing the industrial wastes. The costs shall include but not
be limited to capital expenditures, operation and maintenance expenses,
labor, chemicals, heat and power.
(f) Contract Basis: Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the City from
providing wastewater services to persons outside the corporate limits of the
City under mutually agreeable conditions.
(g) Remedies from Failure to Pay Service Charges: Each Wastewater service
charge levied by or pursuant to this Ordinance is hereby made a lien upon
the corresponding lot, land, or premises served by a connection to the
sanitary sewer system of the City and if the same is not paid within the
period allotted for such payment, said charge shall constitute a lien on the
property served and be inserted in the City tax roll as provided in Section
66.076(7) of the Wisconsin Statutes in the same manner as water rates are
taxed and collected under the provisions of Section 66.069(1) or
66.071(1)(e) of the Wisconsin Statutes as same has been, and from time to
time may be amended or recreated, so far as applicable.
(h) Annual Audit: An audit of the Utility’s financial standing shall be made
annually. This audit will be used to review the adequacy of the extra existing
rates and said rates shall be adjusted if necessary to provide sufficient
revenues to adequately finance the Utility’s operation in accordance with the
original intent of the rate structure.
The annual audit and review shall also be used to insure that each recipient
of sewage service (or user class) is charged in proportion to the cost of
providing said recipient (or user class) with sewage service. Excess
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
8
revenues collected for Operation and Maintenance from a class of users
shall be applied to the costs of Operation and Maintenance attributable to
that class for the next year and the rates shall be adjusted accordingly.
(i) Late Payment Charge: All charges under this Ordinance which are not paid
within 20 days of billing date are subject to a late payment charge of three
percent of the net billing, such charges shall be placed in the operation,
maintenance and replacement account.
(j) Replacement Fund: Annual income from the Wastewater Service Charges
which constitute funds required for “Replacement” shall be separately
accounted for and shall not be utilized for any purposes other than
Replacement.
(k) Notification: Each billing shall identify the amount billed which is attributable
to sewer service.
(3) Use of Public Sewers Required
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be
deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the
City or in any area under the jurisdiction of said City, any human or animal
excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste.
(b) It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the City, or in any
area under the jurisdiction of said City, any wastewater or other polluted
waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance
with subsequent provisions of this Ordinance.
(c) Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain
within the City any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility
intended or used for the disposal of sewage.
(d) The owners of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes where sewerage
facilities would be required, situated within the City and abutting on any
street, alley, or right-of-way in which there is now located or may in the
future be located a public sanitary sewer of the City, are hereby required at
their expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such
facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance within ninety (90) days after date of official
notice to do so.
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
9
(4) Private Wastewater Disposal
(a) Where a public sanitary sewer is not available to structures covered by
Section 3(d), and with a favorable recommendation of the Commission, the
Common Council may allow such structures to be connected to a private
wastewater disposal system complying with the provisions of this section.
(b) Before commencement of the construction of a private wastewater disposal

drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building sewer at the owner’s expense.
(h) Roof-leaders, swimming pool drains, surface drains, ground water drains,
foundation footing drains, and other clear water drains shall be connected
wherever possible with a storm sewer, but they shall not be connected to a
building sewer which discharges into a sanitary sewer or private wastewater
treatment plant. All connections to a sanitary sewer or private wastewater
treatment plant existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance shall
thereafter be illegal. If storm water or clear water is being discharged into a
sanitary sewer, the Commission shall give the offending person 30 days
notice to disconnect. Failure to disconnect after such notice shall authorize
the Commission to cause disconnection and assessment of the costs of
such disconnection against the property involved. The Commission may, in
alternative, institute action for violation of this subsection.
(i) The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to
the requirements of the building and plumbing code and other applicable
rules and regulations of the City.
Further, all sewer laterals which are defective shall, upon the written

the City.
(6) Use of the Public Sewers
(a) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water,
surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, unpolluted
cooling water, swimming pool water or unpolluted industrial process waters
to any sanitary sewer.
(b) Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such
sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet
approved by the Commission and other regulatory agencies. Industrial
cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval
of the Commission and other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, to a
storm sewer or natural outlet.
(c) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following
described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
1. Gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or explosive
liquid, solid, or gas.
2. Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or
gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance,
or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the wastewater
treatment plant.
3. Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 10.0
or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel of the wastewater
works.
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
12
4. Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with
the proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not
limited to ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal,
glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole
blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, paper dishes,
cups, milk containers, sanitary napkins, etc., either whole or ground
by garbage grinders.
(d) The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste shall be
limited in discharges to concentrations or quantities which will not harm
either the sewers, wastewater treatment process or equipment, will not have
an adverse effect on the receiving stream, will not result in violation of the
City’s WPDES permit, or will not otherwise endanger life, health, public
property, or constitute a nuisance. The Commission may set limitations
lower than any limitations established in the regulations below if, in the
Commission’s opinion, more severe limitations are necessary to meet the
above objectives. In making this determination, the Commission shall give
consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to
flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater
treatment plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the wastewater
treatment plant and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on
materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the
sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the
Commission are as follows:
1. Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150 degrees
Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).

as may exceed limits established by any State or Federal regulations.
8. Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a “Slug” as
defined herein.
9. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes
employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the
wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of
other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving
waters.
10. Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form
suspended solids which interfere with the collection system or create
a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
(e) If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Subsection (d) of this Section, and which in
the judgment of the Commission, may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Commission may:
1. Reject the wastes,
2. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers,
3. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or,
4. Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing user charges under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
When considering the above alternatives, the Commission shall give
consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on the discharger.

CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
14
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to
the review and approval of the Commission.
(f) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of
the Commission, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease or other substances specified in Subsection (d)3,
or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients, except that
such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Commission and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In maintaining these interceptors, the owner(s)
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate
means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and
means of disposal which shall be subject to review by the Commission. Any
removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by owner(s)’
personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
Means of disposal shall also be subject to review by the Commission.
(g) Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or required for
any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner(s) at his expense.
(h) When required by the Commission, the owners of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such structure, when required, shall be accessible and safely
located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Commission. The structure shall be installed by the owner at his expense
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(i) The Commission may require a user of sewer services to provide
information needed to determine compliance with this Ordinance. This
information may include:
1. Wastewater discharge peak rate and volume over a specified time
period.
2. Chemical analyses of wastewaters.
3. Information on raw materials, processes, and products affecting
wastewater volume and quality.
4. Quantity and disposition of specific liquid, sludge, oil, solvent, or other
materials important to sewer use control.
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service

pretreatment facility location.
6. Details of wastewater pretreatment facilities.
7. Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials
through spills to the municipal sewer.
(j) All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this Ordinance shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health
Association. Sampling methods, locations, times, durations and frequencies
are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the
Commission.
(k) No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and Commission and
any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the City for treatment subject to payment
therefore at rates established by the Commission in this Ordinance.
(l) Accidental Discharges. The accidental discharge of any prohibited waste
into any sewer shall be reported to the Commission by the person
responsible for the discharge or by the owner or occupant of the premises
where the discharge occurs immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the
fact of such discharge so that steps may be taken to minimize its effect on
the treatment plant.
(m) Exemption Meters. If an industrial user discharging wastes into the public
sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the Commission that significant
amounts of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not
reach the sanitary sewer, the customer may be permitted to have an
exemption water meter(s) installed. Said meter(s) shall be furnished by the
Sewer Department and installed by the Sewer Department.
All other costs shall be at the expense of the customer requiring the
meter(s), including any piping revisions required to insure that only water not
reaching the sanitary sewer is metered by the exemption meter. The
Commission will charge for each meter at the rate of fifty (50) percent of the
basic monthly water rate set for that size meter to compensate for furnishing,
reading, and servicing the meter unless otherwise ordered by the Public
Service Commission. This charge shall be in addition to the wastewater
service charge. The amount of exemption water metered shall be
subtracted from the total amount of water used by the person to determine
the applicable wastewater service charge.
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
16
(n) Industrial users shall be prohibited from discharging more than 450 pounds
per day of BOD or Suspended Solids determined on a monthly average
basis without the approval of the Commission.
(7) Protection From Damage

destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment
which is a part of the wastewater facilities.
(8) Powers and Authority of Inspectors
(a) The Commission and other duly authorized employees of the City bearing
proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties
at reasonable times for the purposes of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to discharge to the sewer
system in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(b) The Commission or duly authorized employees are authorized to obtain
information concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on
the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The
industry may withhold information considered confidential. The industry
must establish that the revelation to the public of the information in question
might result in an advantage to competitors.
(c) While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in
Section 8(a) above, the Commission or duly authorized employees of the
City shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by
the company.

proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private
properties through which the City holds an easement for the purposes of, but
not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and
maintenance of any portion of the wastewater facilities lying within said
easement. All entry and subsequent work if any, on said easement, shall be
done in full accordance with the terms of the easement.
(9) Penalties
(a) Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance except Section (7) shall
be served by the Utility with written notice stating the nature of the violation
and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof.
The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice,
permanently cease all violations.
CHAPTER 8 Sewer Service
17

liable to the City and others, as their interests may appear, for any expense,
loss, or damage occasioned the City or others by reason of such violation,
including any costs in connection with repairing damages to the wastewater
facilities or any downstream user or facilities damaged as a result of a
prohibited discharge or any other violation of this Ordinance.
(10) Validity
(a) Any ordinance or parts of ordinances of the Platteville Municipal Code in
conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
(b) The invalidity of any section, clause, sentence, or provision of this Ordinance
shall not affect the validity of any other part of this Ordinance which can be
given effect without such invalid part or parts.

21.04 PROCEDURE. (A) Pre-Application. It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an
application for approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider consult the Plan Commission
or its staff for advice and assistance. This step does not require formal application, fee, or
filing of a plat, but is intended to explain to the subdivider the purpose and objectives of
these regulations, the comprehensive plan, official map and zoning ordinance and to
informally reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the
proposed development.
(B) Preliminary Plat. (1) Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall
submit a preliminary plat, supplemental data and such copies thereof as shall be
required, to the City Clerk who shall forward same to the Director of Community
Planning and Development at least twenty-five (25) days prior to the Plan
Commission meeting at which action is desired.
(2) After review of the preliminary plat and negotiations with the subdivider on
the changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of public
improvements required, the Plan Commission shall, within forty (40) days of
its submission, recommend to approve, approve conditionally, or reject the
plat. The subdivider shall be notified in writing of any recommended
conditions of approval or the reason for a recommendation of rejection.
Such action of the Plan Commission shall be submitted to the Council for its
approval and the subdivider shall be notified in writing of any changes or
modifications in the action of the Plan Commission and the reasons therefor.
The Common Council shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat.
Parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice
of the public hearing shall be published as a class 2 notice under chapter
985, Wisconsin Statutes.
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
5 As of 6/5/13
(3) Approval of the preliminary plat shall entitle the subdivider to final approval of
the general layout shown by such plat if the final plat conforms substantially
to such layout and conditions of approval have been met.
(C) Final Plat. (1) The final plat and such copies as shall be required shall be
submitted within six months of the approval of the preliminary plat. However, if
approval of the preliminary plat must be obtained from another approving authority
subsequent to approval by the Plan Commission, the final plat shall be submitted
within six months of such approval. The Plan Commission may waive failure to
comply with this requirement.
(2) The City Clerk shall forward the plat to the Plan Commission, after review
and recommendation by the Community Planning and Development
Department, which shall then refer the final plat with its recommendations, to
the Council within 30 days of its submission, unless the time is extended by
the Council. The Council shall approve or reject the final plat within 60 days
of its submission to the City Clerk unless time is extended by agreement with
the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated in writing in the minutes
of the Council meeting and a copy thereof or other written statement of such
reasons supplied to the subdivider.
(3) If the original of the final plat has been filed with some other approving
authority, the subdivider may file a true copy of such plat in lieu of the
original. However, before approval of the Council will be inscribed on the
original of the final plat, the surveyor or subdivider shall certify the respects
in which the original of the final plat differs from the true copy, and all
modifications must first be approved.
(D) Plats Outside the Corporate Limits. When the land to be subdivided lies within the
extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the City, the subdivider shall proceed as
specified in Section 21.04(a) through 21.04(c) of this chapter, except;
(1) Transmittal responsibility lies with the City Clerk, the Town Clerk or
whomever the plat is first submitted, and the subdivider shall indicate which
one in his application for plat approval.
(2) Approval agencies include the City Plan Commission and City Council and
the Subdivider shall comply with the land division laws and ordinances of
these agencies.
(3) All requirements for improvements as specified by the Town Board or by any
special improvement district in matters over which they have jurisdiction,
shall be met before approval and filing of the final plat.
(4) After approval by the governing bodies and recording of the plat, the
subdivider may proceed with the installation of such improvements and
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
6 As of 6/5/13
under such regulations as the Town Board of the town within whose limits
the plat lies, may require.
(E) Replat. A replat shall be made and recorded for any land division which proposes
to change the boundaries of a recorded subdivision or part thereof, as follows:
(1) By either securing the written consent of all parties of interest or by vacating
or altering the recorded plat as provided in Section 236.40 through 236.44 of
the Wisconsin Statutes; and
(2) Filing a Certified Survey Map or a Final Plat as specified in Section 21.08 or
21.04(a) through 21.04(d) of this chapter, depending on whether said replat
constitutes a subdivision or minor subdivision as defined herein.
The City Clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the City Plan
Commission when a proposed replat of lands within the City is filed, and
shall cause notice of the proposed replat and public hearing to be mailed to
the owners of all properties within the extended boundaries or within twohundred
(200) feet of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat.
(F) Minor Subdivision or Lot Consolidation. When it is proposed to either: divide land
into two (2) parcels or building sites, any one of which is less than four (4) acres in
size, or when it is proposed to divide a block, lot or outlot in a recorded subdivision
into not more than four (4) parcels or building sites; or when the owner or two or
more contiguous lots proposes to consolidate them into fewer lots, the owner or
subdivider may do so by use of a Certified Survey Map as provided in Section
21.08 of this chapter; and
(1) The owner or subdivider shall file an adequate number of copies of the Map
and the letter of application with the City Clerk at least twenty (20) days prior
to the meeting of the Plan Commission at which action is desired.
(2) The City Clerk shall, within seven (7) days after filing, transmit copies of the
Map and letter of application to the Plan Commission and to all affected City
boards, commissions, committees, or departments for their review and
recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their
recommendations shall be transmitted to the Plan Commission within fifteen
(15) days from the date the Map is filed. The time limits set forth may be
extended provided the applicant consents thereto.
(3) The Map shall be reviewed by the Plan Commission for conformance with
this ordinance and all other ordinances, rules, regulations, comprehensive
plans and plan components which affect it. The owners of all properties
within 100 feet of the property shown on the Map shall be notified by mail of
the date, time and location of the Plan Commission meeting. The Plan
Commission shall, within forty-five (45) days from the date of filing of the
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
7 As of 6/5/13
Map either approve, conditionally approve or reject said Map. If the Map is
rejected, the reasons therefore shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting
and a written statement thereof forwarded to the owner or subdivider. If the
Map is approved, the Plan Commission shall cause the City Clerk to so
certify on the face of the original Map and return same to the subdivider.
(4) The owner or subdivider shall record the Certified Survey Map with the
County Register of Deeds within thirty (30) days of its approval by the Plan
Commission and shall file three (3) true copies of said Map with the City
Clerk.
(G) Subdivisions Created by Successive Divisions. Where it is not predicable to require
that a final plat of a subdivision created by successive divisions be filed in
accordance with this Chapter, the Council may in lieu thereof order an assessor’s
plat to be made under Section 70.27 of the Wisconsin Statutes, and may assess
the cost thereof as provided in such section, or to the subdivider.
(H) Sale or Exchange of Land Between Adjoining Owners. Whenever a sale or
exchange of land between adjoining owners is contemplated, the parties to the

are and will continue to be met after recording of the Map.
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
8 As of 6/5/13
The Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator shall review the information
provided and shall determine if the transaction is within the provisions of Section
21.02(b)3. The transactions found to be within Section 21.02(b)3 shall not be
required to submit an application for lot redivision before the Planning Commission.
A copy of the instrument(s) used in the conveyance shall be submitted to the City
after the transfer has been recorded with the Grant County Register of Deeds.

21.10 DEDICATIONS OF PUBLIC PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC SITES. (A) Purpose
and Intent. The requirements of this section are established to insure that adequate parks,
open spaces and sites for other public uses are properly located and preserved as the City
grows and that the cost of providing the park and recreation sites and facilities necessary
to serve the additional people brought into the community by land development may be
equitably apportioned on the basis of additional needs created by the development. The
requirements shall apply to all lands within the City proposed for all residential
development, including those which do not involve an additional land division. These
provisions shall not apply to subdivisions within the City’s extraterritorial platting
jurisdiction.
(B) When Required. Any development approval the enables the creation of additional
dwelling units, shall require compliance with this parkland dedication or fee-in-lieuof-
land payment requirement. This includes any land division which creates new
lots. It also include any building permit for more than one dwelling unit per existing
lot (duplex, two flat, or multi-family building). Single family homes to be constructed
on vacant lots which pre-date the adoption of this ordinance are exempt.
(C) Areas to be Dedicated. (1) In the design of a subdivision, including minor
subdivisions, or planned developments, provision shall be made for suitable sites of
adequate area for parks, playgrounds, open spaces, schools and other public
purposes. Such sites as shown on the Master Plan or Comprehensive Plan or
Parks and Open Space Plan shall be made a part of the design. Where such are
not shown on said plans or maps, consideration shall be given to the preservation
of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes, ponds, streams, and
woodland, prairie and wetland plant and animal communities.
(D) Dedication of Parks, Playgrounds, Recreation and Open Spaces. (1) The
developer or subdivider shall dedicate sufficient land area to provide adequate
park, playground, and open space to meet the needs created by the land division,
subdivision or comprehensive development. The minimum dedication shall be the
greater of 2 acres of land or:
(a) Five percent (5%) of the total acreage intended to be used for singlefamily
dwelling units;
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
14 As of 6/5/13
(b) Ten percent (10%) of the total acreage intended to be used for
duplexes;
(c) Fifteen percent (15%) of the total acreage intended to be used for
multi-family dwellings.
(2) For smaller subdivisions the Plan Commission may, if recommended by the
Parks and Recreation Commission, accept a land dedication of less than
two (2) acres, if it determines that the parks and recreation needs of the
subdivision will be met by a smaller dedication.
(E) Combination of Residential Uses. (1) Where a combination of residential uses is
intended, the minimum dedication shall be the sum obtained by adding five percent
(5%) of the acreage intended for single-family dwellings, ten percent (10%) of the
acreage intended for duplex dwellings and fifteen percent (15%) of the acreage
intended for multi-family dwellings. Where a definite commitment is made to the
City by the developer with respect to the number of dwelling units to be constructed
on any parcel of land, the dedication shall be based on that number. Where no
such commitment exists, the dedication shall be based on the maximum number of
dwelling units permitted in the zoning district. The Plan Commission shall
recommend additional dedications if:
(a) The number of lots in the plat or survey is increased, or
(b) The zoning classification is changed to increase the number of
dwelling units allowed, or
(c) The committed number of dwelling units is increased by the
subdivider, developer, or landowner.
(F) Access Linkages. (1) All subdivision, minor subdivisions, and planned development
projects are required to provide convenient pedestrian and bicycle linkages to park
and recreation sites. Where, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, such linkages
are required outside the public street right-of-way, they shall be reserved by
easement and developed as an obligation of the subdivider or developer. The
development of linkages shall not be counted toward the park land dedication
requirements in paragraph 3 above.
(G) Minimum Size of Park and Playground Dedications. (1) Any land to be dedicated
as a requirement of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for the intended park
and recreation uses and shall be at a location convenient to the people served.
Factors used in evaluation of the adequacy of a proposed park and recreation area
shall include, but not be limited to; size, shape, topography, geography, tree cover,
access, and location. The determination of land suitability will be at the sole
discretion of the Plan Commission acting on the recommendation of the Parks and
Recreation Commission. The land reserved for recreation purposes shall have an
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
15 As of 6/5/13
area of at least two (2) acres (with the exception of small subdivisions as
enumerated above). Where the amount of land to be dedicated is less than two
acres, the Parks and Recreation Commission may require that the recreation area
be located at a suitable place on the edge of the proposed land division. In no
case, shall an area of less than one (1) acre be reserved for recreational purposes
if it will be impractical or impossible to secure additional lands in order to increase
its area.
(2) All lands dedicated under this section shall have at least two hundred (200)
feet of frontage on a public street. The Plan Commission and Parks and
Recreation Commission may adjust this frontage requirement if better
alternatives for access are provided. Of the abutting frontage, all costs of
public streets, sidewalks, and utilities (normally accessible) shall be paid for
by the developer or subdivider.
(H) Fees in Lieu of Land. (1) The Plan Commission shall require the developer or
subdivider to pay a fee in lieu of making the land dedication where one or more of
the following conditions exists:
(a) There is no land suitable for parks within the proposed subdivision or
planned development project, or
(b) The dedication of land is not feasible, or
(c) The dedication of land would not be compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan and Community Outdoor Recreation Plan, or
(d) The Plan Commission, acting on the recommendation of the Parks
and Recreation Commission determines that a cash contribution or
other land, fees or some combination will better serve the public
interest.
(2) The Plan Commission and the Parks and Recreation Commission may
require or permit the subdivider or developer to satisfy the dedication
requirements of this section by combining land dedication with fee
payments.
(3) The total fee shall be computed on the basis of the maximum residential use
of each parcel permitted in the particular zoning district under the Zoning
Code. For each proposed residential development, the fee shall be as set
from time to time by the Council via resolution.
(4) The fee-in-lieu of land dedication shall be paid for each unit at the time of
building permit application.
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
16 As of 6/5/13
(5) The Common Council shall place any fee collected pursuant to the
provisions of this section in a separate non-lapsing segregated fund to be
used for land acquisition or development of adequate park, playground,
recreation and open space. Money spent may be expended in other
neighborhoods or community facilities in reasonable proximity to the
subdivision, as determined by the Common Council upon recommendation
by the Parks and Recreation Commission.
(6) Land dedicated for public purposes shall be deeded to the City at the time
the Final Plat is approved. Other areas that may be considered for
dedication to the public may include: school sites, scenic or historic sites,
and other areas.
(I) Suitability of Lands. (1) The Parks and Recreation Commission shall have the
authority to recommend the suitability and adequacy of park lands proposed for
dedication to the Plan Commission/Common Council. Drainageways, wetlands or
areas reserved for streets shall not be considered as satisfying land dedication
requirements.
(J) Deeded to the City. (1) Land dedicated for public purposes shall be approved by
the Plan Commission and Common Council and dedicated prior to the issuance of
the first building permit for the subdivision.
(2) If the proposed dedication is located in a future subdivision phase and is not
adjacent to the subdivision containing the property receiving the first building
permit, adequate access to the park land shall be provided by easement or
similar method until such time as public right-of-way access is constructed to
the park land.
(K) Exceptions. (1) The specific number, amount or location of required dedications,
reservations and fee payments shall be determined by the Plan Commission upon
the recommendation of the City Engineer and the Director of Community Planning
and Development. All dedications shall be approved by the Common Council.
(2) Where a lot or parcel of land for which payment has once been made is
further divided, payment shall be required only for the additional lots or
parcels created. No payment however, shall be required for a lot created by
the division of land under this ordinance, on which a residential structure
already exists, or which is a residential parcel in excess of 5 acres, and not

as a condition of plat approval.
(E) Sidewalks. (1) Where Required.
(a) Residential Subdivisions. Sidewalks are required in all new
residential subdivisions. Sidewalks shall be located on both sides of
public streets. Sidewalks may be located on only one side of a street

(c) Five years have passed since the street was constructed.
When one of the above conditions has been met, the Director of Public
Works may include the construction of the sidewalks in a public contract.
The cost of the sidewalk construction shall be assessed to the adjoining
property owner(s). The property owners may request the Common Council
to defer construction of the sidewalks, after recommendation by the Plan
Commission.
(3) Standards. (a) Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width. When
a sidewalk is combined with a recreation trail or other public way, the Public
Works Director shall determine an adequate width.
(b) Sidewalks shall be installed so that the side furthest from the curb is
located on the right-of-way line. The Director of Public Works may
allow a variance from this requirement when it is in the public interest.
(d) Sidewalk locations and grades shall be determined by the original
developer with approval by the Directory of Public Works prior to

shall be arranged to allow the resubdivision of any such parcels into smaller
lots in accordance with the provisions of these subdivision standards.
(8) Municipal Boundaries. Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines.
21.13 MODIFICATIONS. (A) Variances. When in the judgment of the Plan Commission
and the Council it would be inappropriate to apply literally a provision of this chapter
because the subdivision is located outside the corporate limits, or because extraordinary
hardship would result, the terms of the provision may be waived justice and secure the
public interest, provided that in no event shall the requirement of securing prior approval or
of filing and recording the plat be waived.
(B) Large Scale Developments. These regulations may be modified by the reviewing
authority in the case of a plan for a complete neighborhood unit development that:
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
25 As of 6/5/13
(1) Provides for the needs of the persons expected to reside or work in the
developed area, and is in harmony with the development in adjacent areas
and with the character of the community;
(2) Insures a desirable use of available land in keeping with the principles of
good land use planning;
(3) Takes into account the natural features of the area and provides for and
dedicates sufficient open space;
(4) Includes provisions for efficient circulation and adequate services and
facilities;
(5) Will constitute a desirable and stable community development.
(C) Whenever possible, shopping center sites and land designated for industrial park
development shall be designated according to unit development principles in
contrast to conventional lotting practices.
(D) Legal Guarantees. The plans for a modified development shall include such
covenants, restrictions or other legal provisions as will guarantee the full
achievement of the plan.
(E) Application for Modification. Application for any such modification shall be made in
writing by the subdivider at the time the preliminary plat is filed for consideration,
stating fully and clearly all the facts relied upon by the petitioner, and shall be
supplemented with maps, plans, and other additional data which may aid the
reviewing authority in the analysis of the proposed project.
21.14 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT POLICY. (A) Findings and Declaration of Policy. The
City of Platteville finds that special assessments are sometimes necessary for the
payment of certain municipal work or improvement. It is declared that the policy of the City
of Platteville is to apply special assessments to the following categories of work or
improvement: construction of new sidewalk, construction of new curb and gutter, new
pavement, and installation of new Water and/or Sewer mains. The policy of the City of
Platteville with respect to subdivision development is found in Chapter 21.11. The City of
Platteville shall impose special assessments as an exercise of Police Power, unless
otherwise directed by law.
(B) Intent and Purpose. The purpose of this section is to publicly declare which
categories of municipal work or improvement will normally be assessed to
properties benefited by such work or improvement. It also declares the form of
such assessment and generally how the calculations for special assessments will
be conducted, including deductions.
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
26 As of 6/5/13
(C) Statutory Authority. This section is adopted as authorized under Wisconsin
Statutes, Section 66.0701.
(D) Interpretation. It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or
interfere with any existing rules, regulations, ordinances, resolutions or permits
previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. Where any terms or requirements of
this section may be inconsistent or conflicting, the more restrictive requirements or
interpretations shall control.
(E) Effective Date. This ordinance shall become effective for all special assessments
with Preliminary Resolutions enacted on or after March 12, 2002.
(F) Procedures. The following are the standard procedures with approximate timelines.
(1) Plan and Budget. The Director of Public Works will develop a 5 Year Capital
Investment Plan and consider new sidewalk, new curb and gutter and new
water and/or sewer mains. The Director of Public Works will receive
guidance and approval from the City Manager, Water and Sewer
Commission and Common Council in development of the plan. This 5 Year
Plan will be the basis for budgeting the upcoming year’s projects. This
normally occurs in the fall with budget approval in November/December.
(2) Preliminary Resolution. The Director of Public Works will prepare
Preliminary Resolution(s) for consideration by the Common Council for all
new sidewalk, new curb and gutter and new water and/or sewer mains. The
resolution shall specify the intention to finance the public work or
improvement or current service in whole or in part by special assessments,
and the time, after completion of the work or improvement, when the amount
of the assessments will be determined and levied, the number of annual
installments, if any, in which assessments may be paid, the rate of interest to
be charged on the unpaid balance and the terms on which any of the
assessments may be deferred while no use of the improvement is made in
connection with the property.
This process normally takes two separate Council meeting dates and should
be completed before the project is started. The preferred form of the
Preliminary Resolution is for the City to exercise Police Powers under
Wisconsin Statutes, Section 66.0703.
(3) Report of the Director of Public Works. The Director of Public Works will
prepare the report specified in the Preliminary Resolution in the manner
provided by Section 66.0703(4) & (5), Wis. Stats. This will normally occur
after the receipt of bids for projects done by private contractors. If the
project is to be completed by City or Utility employees, the Director will use
the Engineer Estimate as the basis for assessment. Calculations will be on
a fair share basis as follows:
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
27 As of 6/5/13
(a) New Sidewalk. The Director of Public Works will determine the cost
of installation per linear foot of sidewalk as specified in paragraph C.
This linear foot determination will be based on the linear feet of the
property frontage. If the project is partially funded with Federal and/or
State funds, the cost per linear foot of sidewalk will be on a
percentage basis of the City’s share of the project, e.g. if the Federal
and/or State share of a project which includes new sidewalk
installation is 50%, then the assessment will be for 50% of the cost of
installation per linear foot.
(b) New Curb and Gutter. The Director of Public Works will determine
the cost of installation per linear foot of curb and gutter. This linear
foot determination will be based on the linear feet of the property
frontage. If the project is partially funded with Federal and/or State
funds, the cost per linear foot of curb and gutter will be on a
percentage basis of the City’s share of the project, e.g. if the Federal
and/or State share of a project which includes new curb and gutter
installation is 50%, then the assessment will be for 50% of the cost of
installation per linear foot.
(c) New Water and/or Sewer Main. The Director of Public Works will
determine the cost of installation of new water and sewer main to
service a new subdivision or area. The assessment will be calculated
on an area basis. The area basis will be calculated on the size of the
individual lots served by the new utility. If an owner has a lot that
could be subdivided, but has not intention to ever do so; he/she may
request in writing to the Director of Public Works that the City install
only one water service and one private sewer lateral connection for
the multiple size lot.
(d) New Pavement. The Director of Public Works will determine the cost
of installation per linear foot of new pavement. This linear foot
determination will be based on the linear feet of the property frontage.
If the project is partially funded with Federal and/or State funds, the
cost per linear foot new pavement will be on a percentage basis of
the City’s share of the project, e.g. if the Federal and/or State share of
a project which includes new pavement installation is 50%, then the
assessment will be for 50% of the cost of installation per linear foot.
(4) Public Hearing. The City Clerk will schedule a Public Hearing and notify
affected property owners according to statutes. The Common Council will
conduct a Public Hearing to determine the appropriateness of assessment,
the amount of assessment and payment schedule. At the conclusion of the
Public Hearing, the Common Council will take action on the assessment as
appropriate. The Director of Public Works will execute the project as
authorized by the Council.
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
28 As of 6/5/13
(5) Final Resolution. The Common Council will approve or disapprove a Final
Resolution subsequent to the completion of the work or improvement. The
form of the resolution will be as prescribed by law. The Director of Public
Works shall prepare and submit a report, in the manner required by Section
66.0703(5), Wis. Stats., which shall contain a statement of the final cost of
the work, service or improvement. The form will be as prescribed by law.
Whenever the final cost of the work, service or improvement is more than
ten percent (10%) higher than was estimated in the Report of the Director of
Public Works that accompanied the Preliminary Resolution, the Council shall
consider whether to assess for the actual cost of the project or for some
lesser amount. The policy of the City will be to allow payments over a period
of seven (7) years at an appropriate interest rate, unless the assessment is
less than $100.
(6) Completion. The City Clerk will publish the final resolution as prescribed by
law and forward the action to the City Finance Director for collection in
accordance with the resolution.
21.15 AMENDMENTS. (A) Authority. Whenever public necessity, convenience, general
welfare, changes in State requirements or good subdivision practice require it, these
provisions may be amended by the Common Council, subject to review and
recommendation by the Plan Commission.
(B) Initiation. A change or amendment may be initiated by the Common Council, the
Plan Commission, City staff, or by a petition of one or more persons affected by
these provisions.
21.16 PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. (A) Penalties. Any person who fails to
comply with any provision of this Chapter, shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less
than $25 nor more than $200, together with the cost of prosecution for each violation and
in default of payment thereof, shall be imprisoned in the county jail until payment of such
forfeiture and costs, but not exceeding 30 days. In addition the remedies provided by
Sections 236.30 and 236.31 of the Wisconsin Statutes shall be available to the City.
(B) Enforcement. (1) Whenever it shall come to the knowledge of the City Engineer,
the Building Inspector, any member of the reviewing authority or City police force,
that this ordinance or the state statutes governing plats have been violated, such
violations shall be reported to the City Attorney for appropriate action.
(2) No building permit shall be issued for any subdivision or part thereof, until
the provisions of this Ordinance have been complied with and no occupancy
permit shall be issued until all required improvements except those
specifically deferred, have been completed and approved by the City
Engineer.
CHAPTER 21 Subdivision
29 As of 6/5/13
(3) The City Assessor is hereby instructed not to divide for assessment or taxing
purposes, any properties that are being subdivided contrary to these
regulations until the reviewing authority and the City Attorney have been
notified and their recommendations submitted to the City Council.
21.17 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTION. It is not intended by this
Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements,
covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued
pursuant to laws. However, where this Ordinance, imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.
21.18 INTERPRETATION, SEVERABILITY AND REPEALER. (A) In their interpretation
and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.
(B) If any section, provision or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall
not be affected thereby.
(C) All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent or conflicting with
this Ordinance, to the extent of the inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.
21.19 TITLE AND EFFECTIVE DATE. (A) Title. This Ordinance shall be known as,
referred to, or cited as the “Land Division Ordinance, City of Platteville, Wisconsin”.
(B) Effective Date. This Ordinance shall be effective after adoption by the Common
Council and publication or posting as provided by law.
21.20 APPLICATION FEE. In addition to the plats, maps, and other information as
specified in this Chapter, applications shall also include an application fee as established
from time to time by the Common Council.

22.0514 R-LO LIMITED OCCUPANCY RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT.
(A) PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose and intent of the R-LO Limited Occupancy Residential Overlay District
is to protect, preserve, and enhance low-density single-family housing in areas zoned
R-1 Single-family Residential and R-2 One & Two-family Residential, and within the
local or state/national residential historic districts in the City.
This district establishes restrictions which operate to preserve the attractiveness,
desirability, and privacy of residential neighborhoods by limiting the numbers of
occupants permitted in residential properties and limiting the types and numbers
of rental properties, and thereby preclude the deleterious effects on a
neighborhood with regard to property deterioration, increased density, congestion,
noise and traffic levels, and reduction of property values. The goal of the overlay
district is to allow the City and the owners of property within residential
neighborhoods to control the number of occupants and the types of rental
properties that are permitted in one-family dwellings within their neighborhood. It
is also the purpose of the district to achieve the following objectives:
(1) To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise, congestion, and
nuisance impacts;
(2) To maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a desirable
living environment for residents by preserving the owner occupied character
of the neighborhood;
(3) To prevent excessive traffic and parking problems in the neighborhoods.
CHAPTER 22 Zoning

(B) OVERLAY DISTRICT RESTRICTIONS
In the R-LO Limited Occupancy Residential Overlay District the definition of “family”
as set forth in Platteville Municipal Ordinance Section 22.15 Definitions shall be
modified within the overlay district boundary. This definition is used to determine the
allowable number of persons that can legally reside in a dwelling unit. The definition
to be used within the district is set forth below.
“Family” shall mean one of the following groups of individuals, but not more than one
group at a time:
(1) Any number of persons, all of whom are related to each other by blood,
adoption, marriage, domestic partnership formed under Wis. Stats. 770, or
legal guardianship, along with up to one (1) roomer or boarder not so related,
living together in one dwelling unit as a single housekeeping entity; or
(2) Not more than two (2) persons who are not related by blood, adoption, or
marriage, living together in one dwelling unit as a single housekeeping entity;
or
(3) Two (2) unrelated individuals and any children of either or both of them living
as a single-housekeeping unit.

or a child, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew,
niece, great-grandparent, or great-grandchild of a person in a domestic partnership.
The term “related” does not include other, more distant relationships such as cousins.
The definition of family includes up to two (2) guests if the guests live and cook
together with the family in a single dwelling unit and do not pay rent or give other
consideration for the privilege of staying with the family. The definition of “guest”
under this section is defined as a person who stays with a family for a period of less
than thirty days within any rolling one-year period and does not utilize the dwelling as
a legal address for any purpose.
(C) USES PERMITTED

except as they pertain to the allowable occupancy of a dwelling unit. The restrictions
set forth herein are in addition to the restrictions and requirements of the underlying
district applicable to a particular property. If there is a conflict between the restrictions
and requirements associated with the district, those most restrictive to the use of the

(D) OVERLAY DISTRICT CREATION
The R-LO Limited Occupancy Residential Overlay District may be established over
designated areas of the City of Platteville.

requirements must be submitted to the City Clerk.
1. Each petition must be circulated by a person who owns
property within the proposed district and be signed by the
circulator.
2. The petition must contain the signature and address of all the
parcel owners within the proposed boundary of the overlay
district, exclusive of public property. Jointly owned parcels will
be considered owned by a single person for purpose of
petitioning and any co-owner may sign a petition for such
parcel. If a person owns more than one parcel of property
within the proposed district, they may sign the petition once
for each parcel they own.
3. Each person signing the petition must also enter, on the
petition, adjacent to their signature, the date that the person
signed the petition.
4. The petition must accurately advise the signer of what
restrictions would be imposed on the property if the overlay
district were established.
5. The properties to be included in the proposed overlay district
must be described in the petition by address.
6. When submitted, no signature dated earlier than six (6)
months prior to the time the petition is filed with the City Clerk
shall be counted in determining the validity of the petition.

8. An application fee in an amount as set from time to time by a
resolution of the Common Council shall be submitted to cover
the rezoning costs of establishing the district.
(b) Upon presentation to the City Clerk for review, the Clerk shall
determine whether the petition is in conformity with the conditions of
this section.
1. If the petition is not in conformity with the requirements of this
section, the clerk shall reject the petition and return it to the
person who filed the petition with a written explanation as to
why the petition does not meet the requirements of this
section.
2. If the petition is rejected for failure to comply with the boundary
requirements, it may be resubmitted with the proper boundary
lines if it is accompanied by certification that a copy of the
petition and written notice was mailed to each property
affected by the change, notifying them that their property was
either added to or deleted from the petition and if by the
correction of the boundary line the petition still meets all other
requirements of the code.
3. If the petition is rejected for an insufficient number of valid
signatures, it may be resubmitted with the additional
signatures necessary to have it comply as long as the other
signatures remain valid.
4. If the petition is determined to be in conformity with the
requirements of this section, the Zoning Administrator shall
draft an appropriate ordinance and submit the ordinance for
approval following the procedures set forth in this code.
(3) RECOMMENDATIONS. The Plan Commission shall review all proposed
changes and amendments and shall recommend that the district be approved
as requested, modified, or denied. The recommendation shall be made in
writing to the Common Council.

consideration of the Plan Commission’s recommendations, the Common
Council shall vote on the passage of the proposed district. If the petition
described in Section 22.0514(D)(2) is signed by the owners of a minimum of
seventy five percent (75%) but less than one hundred percent (100%) of the
parcels within the proposed overlay district, such district shall not become

(f) The Plan Commission and Council shall consider the following
standards when reviewing the results of the required impact
assessment/study:
1. Traffic Impact Standards. a. The Level of Service (LOS) of all
streets and intersections evaluated under this Ordinance shall
not be reduced below a level determined acceptable by the City
Engineer.
b. The design goal for all streets, signalized intersections,
and turning movements at unsignalized intersections
shall be LOS C or better. For streets and intersections
currently functioning at LOC C or better, mitigation
measures shall be provided to maintain or improve the
existing LOS, if reasonably possible. Where the existing
LOS is D, mitigation measures shall at a minimum,
maintain the existing conditions or upgrade the LOS to
C or better.
c. For all streets and intersections that are currently failing
(LOS E or worse), the goal of mitigation measures is to
provide a LOS D or better. At a minimum, existing
conditions at failing streets and intersecting shall not be
further degraded as a result of the project.
d. Driveways shall be located to limit conflict points with
existing driveways and intersections and shall meet
intersection design standards for secondary roads
required in the Chapter 21, the Subdivision Regulations.
e. Shared driveways and service roads shall be used to
control access onto existing streets.

22.07 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PUD).
(A) PURPOSE AND INTENT:
(1) Planned Unit Development District regulations are intended to permit
greater flexibility and, consequently, more creative and imaginative design
for the development of a site than is possible under conventional zoning
regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient
use of land which will provide, over a period of time, development of land
that promotes the maximum benefit from coordinated site planning,
diversified location of structures and mixed compatible uses, while also
providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a higher level of
amenities, adequate buffering between adjacent uses, and preservation of
the natural qualities of open spaces. The Planned Unit Development
procedure requires a high degree of cooperation between the developer
and the City. The procedure described herein is designed to give the
developer general plan approval before completing all detailed design work
while providing the City with assurances that the project will retain the
character envisioned at the time of approval.
(2) Planned Unit Developments have the potential to create undesirable
impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general
requirements of this Section. In addition to such potential, Planned Unit
Developments also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on
nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a
binding site plan, landscape plan and architectural plan, and on a case by
case basis. In order to prevent undesirable impacts from occurring, all
Planned Unit Developments are required to meet certain procedural
requirements applicable only to Planned Unit Developments, in addition to
the general requirements of this Section. A public hearing process is
required to review a request for a Planned Unit Development. This process
shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with the
process required for a conditional use, with several additional requirements.
(3) Planned Unit Developments are designed to forward both the aesthetic and
economic development objectives of the City by adhering to standards
consistent with sound land use and urban design and by controlling the site
design and the appearance, density or intensity of development in terms of
more flexible requirements for land uses, density, intensity, bulk,
landscaping, and parking requirements. In exchange for such flexibility, the
CHAPTER 22 Zoning
69 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
Planned Unit Development shall provide a much higher level of site design,
architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional
excellence than is normally required for other developments.
(B) GENERAL PROVISIONS:
(1) The Common Council may establish Planned Unit Development Districts
which will, over a period of time, tend to promote the maximum benefit from
coordinated area site planning by permitting the diversified location of
structures and mixed dwelling types and mixed compatible uses. Adequate
buffering and preserving open spaces shall also be provided in a PUD.
(a) Permitted Uses: All residential, institutional, business, or
manufacturing land uses may be permitted within a PUD.
(b) Mixed Uses: A mix of different uses within a PUD District may be
permitted if the Common Council determines that the mix of uses is
compatible and appropriate to achieve the objectives of the PUD.
(c) Number of Buildings on a Lot: The Planned Unit Development
District may allow more than one principal structure on a lot.
(d) Density, Intensity and Bulk Requirements: The Planned Unit
Development District may permit the modification of requirements for
density, intensity, and bulk (building height, setback, area, etc.) from
what is permitted in the conventional zoning districts.
(e) Parking Requirements. Requirements for parking may be waived or
modified within a Planned Unit Development.
(f) Minimum Area for a Planned Unit Development District: Planned
Unit Development Districts are intended to provide flexibility to
encourage more creative design for all sizes of sites than would be
allowed under conventional zoning. To achieve this goal, there is no
minimum parcel or lot size area for a PUD.
(2) Planned Unit Developments shall be permitted with the approval of a
Planned Unit Development Zoning District, specific to the approved PUD.
(3) Requested modifications from standards in Section 22 relating to land use,
density and intensity, bulk (building height, setback, area, etc.),
landscaping, and parking and loading requirements shall be made explicit
by the Applicant in the application, and shall be recommended by the Plan
Commission and approved explicitly by the Common Council. If not so
requested and approved, such modifications shall not be permitted.
(4) Only development which is explicitly depicted on the required site plan
CHAPTER 22 Zoning
70 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
approved by the Common Council as part of the Planned Unit Development
shall be permitted, even if such development (including all aspects of land
use, density and intensity, bulk, landscaping, and parking and loading), is
otherwise listed as permitted in the conventional zoning districts or
elsewhere in Section 22.
(C) APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
(1) In recommending approval or conditional approval of a Planned Unit
Development (PUD), the Plan Commission shall find that the application
meets all of the criteria below or will meet them when the Commission's
conditions are complied with. The Common Council shall also find, in granting
approval or conditional approval, that all of the following criteria are met or will
be met when the conditions to which the approval is made subject are
complied with:
(a) Quality Design. The PUD represents a more creative approach to the
unified planning of development and a higher standard of integrated
design and amenities than could be achieved under otherwise
applicable zoning district and subdivision regulations, and on this
basis, modifications to the use and design standards established by
such regulations are warranted.
(b) Meets PUD Requirements. The PUD meets the requirements for
Planned Unit Developments set forth in this Ordinance, and no
modifications to the use and design standards otherwise applicable are
allowed other than those permitted herein.
(c) Consistent with Comprehensive Plan. The PUD is generally consistent
with the goals and objectives of the City Comprehensive Plan as
viewed in light of any changed conditions since its adoption.
(d) Public Welfare. The benefits to the public and the community as a
result of the PUD will exceed any significant negative impact on the
use and enjoyment of other properties in its vicinity. The PUD will not
seriously harm environmental quality in the neighborhood, or impede
the orderly development of surrounding property.
(e) Natural Features. The design of the PUD is as consistent as practical
with the preservation of natural features of the site such as flood plains,
wooded areas, steep slopes, natural drainage ways, or other areas of
sensitive or valuable environmental character.
(f) Circulation and Access. Streets, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, bicycle
paths, off-street parking, and off-street loading as appropriate to the
planned land uses are provided, and are adequate in location, size,
capacity, and design to ensure safe and efficient circulation of
CHAPTER 22 Zoning
71 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
automobiles, trucks, bicycles, pedestrians, fire trucks, garbage trucks,
and snow plows as appropriate without blocking traffic, creating
unnecessary pedestrian-vehicular conflict, creating unnecessary
through traffic within the PUD, or unduly interfering with the safety or
capacity of adjacent streets.
(g) Open Space and Landscaping. The quality and quantity of public and
common open spaces and landscaping provided are consistent with
the standards of design and amenity required of a PUD. The size,
shape, and location of a substantial portion of total public and common
open space provided in residential areas render it useable for
recreation purposes. Open space between all buildings is adequate to
allow for light and air, access by firefighting equipment, and for privacy
where walls have windows, terraces, or adjacent patios. Open space
along the perimeter of the development is sufficient to protect existing
and permitted future uses of adjacent property from adverse effects
from the development.
(h) Covenants and Restrictions. Where individual parcels are to be later
sold, adequate provision has been made in the form of deed
restrictions, restrictive covenants and/or rules and regulations
contained in owners or condominium associations documentation, or
the like for:
1. The preservation and maintenance of any open spaces,
thoroughfares, utilities, water retention or detention areas, and
other common elements not to be dedicated to the City or
another public body.
2. Such control of the use and exterior design of individual
structures, if any, as is necessary for continuing conformance
to the PUD Plan, such provision to be binding on all future
owners.
(i) Public Services. The land uses, intensities, and phasing of the PUD
are consistent with the anticipated ability of the City, the school
districts, and other public bodies to provide and economically support
police and fire protection, water supply, storm water management,
sewage disposal, schools, and other public facilities and services
without placing undue burden on existing residents and businesses.
(j) Phasing. Each development phase of the PUD can, together with any
phases that preceded it, exist as an independent unit that meets all of
the foregoing criteria and all other applicable regulations herein even if
no subsequent phase should ever be completed. The provision and
improvement of public or common area improvements, open spaces,
CHAPTER 22 Zoning
72 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
and amenities, or the provision of financial security guaranteeing the
installation of such improvements is phased generally proportionate to
the phasing of the number of dwelling units or the amount of nonresidential
floor area.
(D) QUALITY OF DESIGN
(1) To be granted the flexibility permitted by this ordinance, a Planned Unit
Development must evidence a high quality level of design and amenities.
Among the features that may evidence such quality and amenities are:
(a) Amount and quality of landscaping or screening.
(b) Amount, quality, and interconnectedness of common open space.
(c) Provision of pedestrian or bicycle paths separated from streets.
(d) Preservation of drainage ways, trees, habitat and other natural
features.
(e) Provision of common recreational facilities.
(f) Enclosed, underground, depressed, or highly landscaped parking
areas.
(g) Varied building setbacks or other measures to reduce monotony in
design.

(i) Incorporation of storm water management Best Management
Practices (BMPs).
(j) Incorporation of green building, smart growth and other sustainable
design principles.
(k) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and/or LEED
Neighborhood Design (LEED-ND) certifications and/or other nationally
recognized sustainable design criteria and standards.
(l) More efficient and economic arrangement of buildings, pedestrian,
bicycle and vehicle circulation and access systems and facilities.
(m) Provides a buffer or transition between the PUD and adjacent and
nearby zoning districts, land uses, and development intensities.

have been paid and either all public construction has been completed and
approved, or a development agreement has been approved and executed
and financial security has been provided. For staged development, such
development agreements may provide for the construction of improvements
and the use of common areas outside of the subject stage.
(3) The Common Council may revoke an approved PUD, if the project has not
commenced within two (2) years. In the event the PUD is revoked, the
zoning of the property shall revert to the zoning district in place prior to
approval of the PUD.

CHAPTER 22 Zoning
82 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
Commission for its review. The Plan Commission shall determine whether
the change, revision or addition is minor or if the change is substantial. A
minor change would include small modifications to the approved SIP. A
substantial change would include major modifications to the SIP, or
modifications to the GDP, because the change materially affects the
intended design of the project and the impact of the project on neighboring
uses. Based on the significance of the revision, the Plan Commission shall
also determine what public hearings may be needed to review the change.
(2) If the change is determined to be a minor adjustment to the SIP, the Plan
Commission shall review the request and may approve the change without
a public hearing. The recommendation of the Plan Commission shall then
be forwarded to the Common Council for final action. The Common Council
may also consider the change without a public hearing.
(3) If the requested change is determined by the Plan Commission to be
substantial, because of its effect on the intended design of the project or on
neighboring uses, a public hearing shall be held by the Plan Commission to
review the proposed change. The City shall give written notice to all property
owners within 500 feet of the subject property prior to the Plan Commission
meeting at which action shall be taken. The recommendation and findings
of the Plan Commission shall be forwarded to the Common Council. A
substantial change may also require that the Common Council hold a public
hearing before taking final action on the amendment.
(4) If the Common Council approves any substantial or material change, an
ordinance shall be passed and any necessary amendments to any
development agreement(s) shall be executed prior to the Developer
proceeding with implementation of any approved change or modification.

months, any future use of the structure, land, or water shall conform to the
provisions of this ordinance. When a nonconforming use or structure

value at the time such event occurred, it shall not be restored except so as to
comply with the provisions of this ordinance.
(4) Notwithstanding the above, for properties in the City of Platteville, a specified
or conditional use in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts that is nonconforming
because it is located on lands which do not conform to the regulations of the
district in which said lands are located, may be rebuilt if such reconstruction is
identical in building area and use to the original structure and the
reconstruction is completed within one year of the damage occurring.
(5) Notwithstanding the above, a structure located in the B-2 Central Business
District that has a non-conforming residential use, including residential use of
the ground floor, and that is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood,
the public enemy or other calamity to the extent of more than 50% of its

use if such reconstruction meets the following conditions:
(a) A Building Permit for the reconstruction is obtained within twelve (12)
months of the date of the catastrophe.
(b) The reconstruction will not increase any dimensional nonconformity of
the building or structure, except as may be necessitated by compliance

damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, the public enemy or other
calamity to the extent of more than 50% of its equalized value at the time
such event occurred, may be rebuilt for the same use if such reconstruction
meets the following conditions:
(a) A Building Permit for the reconstruction is obtained within twelve (12)
months of the date of the catastrophe.
(b) The reconstruction will not increase any dimensional nonconformity of
the building or structure, except as may be necessitated by

and access provisions of this ordinance.
(2) Existing nonconforming structures shall not be extended, enlarged,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except when required to do so
by law or so as to comply with the provisions of this ordinance.
(3) Notwithstanding the above, an existing nonconforming principal structure in
the R-1, R-2, and R-3 districts which is used for any specified or conditional
use, may be extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, but only
if such change does not result in an increase to the nonconforming nature of
the structure. No such change may increase the parking requirements for the
use unless on-site parking spaces can be provided in accordance with Section
22.09.
(4) When a nonconforming structure is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, violent
wind, vandalism, ice, snow, mold, or infestation it may be reconstructed if such
CHAPTER 22 Zoning
122 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
change does not result in an increase to the nonconforming nature of the
structure.
(C) CHANGES AND SUBSTITUTIONS
(1) Once a nonconforming structure or use has been changed to conform with
this ordinance it shall not revert back to a nonconforming use or structure.
(2) Except for bringing a use into conformance, any substitution of an existing
nonconforming use must first be approved by the Board of Appeals. The
Board of Appeals may only approve substituting an existing nonconforming
use with an equal or more restrictive nonconforming use. Should the Board
of Appeals permit the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use,
the substituted use shall remain a nonconforming use, subject to the
requirements of this Section. The Board of Appeals may impose conditions
upon the substituted use to insure that any impacts to the surrounding area

(H) STANDARDS. A variance from the provisions of this ordinance shall not be granted

(a) The proposed variance will not be contrary to the public interest or
result in harm to the general public.
(b) The property has a special condition or unique physical limitation, such
as a steep slope, soil type, wetland areas, etc., that limits the ability of
the applicant to conform to the regulations.
(c) The special condition or unique physical limitation creates an
unnecessary hardship, which exists when compliance with the strict
letter of the restrictions governing area, setbacks, height, etc., would
unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a
permitted purpose, or would render conformity with such restrictions
unnecessarily burdensome.
(d) The special condition or unique physical limitation must relate to the
property and not to the owner, since a personal condition or preference
of a landowner is not a condition affecting property.
(e) The hardship must be unique to the property and not self-created.
(2) Use Variance. A use variance is defined as a request to use the property for
a purpose not permitted by the regulations.
CHAPTER 22 Zoning
128 A s o f 7 / 3 1 /1 9
(a) The proposed variance will not be contrary to the public interest or
result in harm to the general public.
(b) The property has a special condition or unique physical limitation, such
as a steep slope, soil type, wetland areas, etc., that limits the ability of
the applicant to conform to the regulations.
(c) The special condition or unique physical limitation creates an
unnecessary hardship, which exists when compliance with the strict
letter of the regulations results in the applicant having no reasonable
use of the property in the absence of a variance. The variance should
not conflict with the purpose of the zoning ordinance.
(d) The special condition or unique physical limitation must relate to the
property and not to the owner, since a personal condition or preference
of a landowner is not a condition affecting property.
(e) The hardship must be unique to the property and not self-created.
(I) DECISION
(1) The Board of Appeals shall decide all appeals and applications within 30 days
of the final hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the Board’s decision to
the appellant or applicant, the Building Inspector, the Chair of the Plan
Commission, and the City Clerk.
(2) Conditions may be placed upon any building permit ordered or authorized by
the Board. Conditions may be placed on any decision made which does not
involve a building permit.
(3) Variances, substitutions, or use permits granted by the Board shall expire
within twelve (12) months unless a building permit has been approved (if
required) and substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant.
(J) REVIEW BY COURT OF RECORD. Any person or persons aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court of
Grant County. All appeals must be filed with the court within 30 days after receipt of

defect or defects upon which the designation and placarding action were based
have been eliminated.
(e) No person shall deface or remove any placard from any building or structure or part
thereof which has been condemned as unfit for human habitation and placarded as

26.01.4 TITLE
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City
of Platteville, Wisconsin.

flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-
30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as

other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO
or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed

Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR
and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (see s. 26.08
Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA

portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on
the FIRM.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood
limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be
covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a
BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones

Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map
and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subd (a) or
CHAPTER 26 Floodplain Zoning
Page 4 of 43 As of 3/2/16
(b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended
according to s. 26.08 Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on
a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use
permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning
administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development
field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was
determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this
section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over
the district boundary line shall be settled according to s. 26.07.3(3) and the
criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on
established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any
map amendment or revision pursuant to s. 26.08 Amendments.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above
the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 26.08 Amendments.
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall
be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local,
state, and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties
are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits.
State agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when s.
30.2022, Stats., applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s.
62.23 for cities; s. 61.35 for villages; or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to

deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are
the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing
body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by
the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR
116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light
of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in
effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering
experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not
imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses
will be free from flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does not
create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result
from reliance on this ordinance.
(11) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall
not be affected.
(12) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES
The Grant County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality
for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an

reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross
sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall
be identical to those in the effective model and result in water
surface elevations and topwidths computed by the revised
models matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The Effective
Model shall not be truncated.
c. Mapping
Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the
Department for review which meet the following conditions:

Appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the
character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the Certificate
of Appropriateness. The Commission shall make the decision within fortyfive
(45) days of the filing of the application.

obtained without the presentation of the Certificate of Appropriateness
required for the proposed work. The property owner shall ensure that the
necessary permits are obtained for the property.

approved by the Building Inspector or Community Planning and
Development Director as designees of the Commission. The types of
projects that can be approved by these designees shall be described in a
written policy and adopted by the Commission. Unless the Commission or
the designee(s) approves a Certificate of Appropriateness, a building permit
shall not be issued for any such work.
C. Appeals. Should the Commission choose to not issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the
applicant may appeal such decision to the Common Council within thirty (30) days.
The Commission’s decision to not issue a Certificate of Appropriateness within
thirty (30) days of the filing of the application shall be deemed a denial of the
request, which may be appealed as provided herein. The Commission shall, with
the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a
Certificate of Appropriateness within the guidelines of this ordinance. Denial of a
Certificate of Appropriateness may be appealed following the procedures described
in Section 17.06(A).
D. Recognition of Historic Structures, Sites and Districts. At such time as a historic
structure, site or district has been properly designated, the Commission, in cooperation
with the property owner, may cause to be prepared and erected on such property a
suitable plaque declaring that such property is a historic structure, site or district.

28.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the community and to facilitate the adequate
provision of parks and playgrounds by imposing impact fees upon developers to pay for
the capital costs of public facilities that are necessary to accommodate land development.
This chapter is intended to impose impact fees in order to finance public utilities and
facilities, the demand for which is generated by new residential development. The City is
responsible for and will meet, through the use of general City revenues, all capital
improvement needs associated with existing development. Only needs created by new
development will be met by impact fees. Impact fees shall be spent on new or enlarged
capital facilities improvements required by new developments that pay the fees.
28.02 AUTHORITY. Authority for this section is provided by Wisconsin Statutes 66.0617.
The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit the power of the City to adopt

Associates in January of 2007, which is on file in the office of the City Clerk and available
for inspection and/or copying in accordance with the State Public Records and Property

effect of recovering these capital costs through impact fees on the availability of
affordable housing within the City.
28.06 FINDING OF REASONABLENESS AND STATUTORY COMPLIANCE. Impact
fees imposed by this Chapter are found by the Common Council of the City to be

dedications under Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes, or any other items of
value.

specifically to provide or pay for the public facilities for which the impact fees
are imposed.

reduction in the amount of impact fees imposed on a developer that provides
low-cost housing in accordance with guidelines established by the Common
Council, except no amount of any impact fee for which an exemption or
reduction is provided under this section may be shifted to any other
development in the land development in which the low-cost housing is
located or to any other land development in the City.
(4) New development in a Tax Incremental Financing District, whether such
district is now existing or created in the future, may be exempted from the
imposition of Impact Fees for the reason that the City desires to offer
developers an incentive to create projects which will improve blighted
neighborhoods and/or create opportunities for employment.
28.08 IMPOSITION OF IMPACT FEES. Impact fees shall be imposed by the Common
Council on any land division, planned development, conditional use permit, site plan
review or building permit for new construction on vacant land, the construction of additional
buildings on developed land, and the expansion of existing buildings, at the time any
approval or permit is granted which is located in an area on which an impact fee has been
imposed. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein required shall provide for the
CHAPER 28 Parks Impact Fee
payment of duplicate impact fees under circumstances where a land development is the
subject of more than one (1) approval or permit.
28.09 USE OF FUNDS.
(a) Funds collected from impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the
proportionate costs of providing public facilities that may become necessary due to
land development. These costs may include the costs of debt service on bonds or
similar debt instruments when the debt has been incurred for the purpose of
proceeding with designated public facilities projects prior to the collection of all
anticipated impact fees for the projects, to reimburse the City or Utility for advances
of other funds or reserves, and such other purposes consistent with Wisconsin
Statutes section 66.0617 which are recorded and approved by the City Council.
(b) The City may issue bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of
indebtedness in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided
by law in furtherance of the provision of capital improvement projects. Funds
pledged toward retirement of bonds, revenue certificates, or other obligations of
indebtedness for such projects may include impact fees and other City revenues as
may be allowed by the Common Council. Impact fees paid pursuant to this
ordinance, however, shall be restricted to use solely and exclusively for financing
directly or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of
indebtedness for the cost of capital improvements as specified herein.
(c) These impact fees shall be collected until the capital costs associated with the
projects specified in the Parks and Playgrounds Needs Assessment Report, as
amended from time to time, have been incurred and satisfied unless such time
period exceeds seven (7) years beyond projected satisfaction of indebtedness of
the specified projects for which these impact fees are imposed.

placed by the City of Platteville Treasurer in segregated interest-bearing accounts
and shall be accounted for separately from other funds of the City of Platteville.
Impact fee revenues and interest earned on impact fee revenues may be expended
by the City of Platteville only for the capital costs for which the impact fees were
imposed and shall be expended on a first-in first-out basis.
(c) Refund. Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar
quarter immediately following seven years from the date the impact fee was paid for

planning and financing all public facilities identified in the Parks and Playgrounds
Need Assessment.

(a) Upon receipt of impact fees, the City Clerk/Treasurer or the Utility Manager, as
applicable, shall be responsible for the placement of such funds into separate
accounts as hereinafter specified. All such funds shall be deposited in interestbearing
accounts in a bank authorized to receive deposits of City of Utility funds, as
applicable. Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and
shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds of such account.
(b) The City Clerk/Treasurer or Utility Manager shall maintain and keep accurate
financial records for each such account that shall show the source and
disbursement of all revenues; that shall account for all monies received; that shall

in the capital improvements program for the particular development sub-area or for
City-wide capital improvements, as specified in the program; and that shall provide
an annual report for each impact fee account showing the source and amount of all
funds collected and the projects that were funded.

City to pay the capital costs of all public facilities for which they were imposed, or in the
alternative, refunded to the current owner of the real property with respect to which the
impact fees were imposed. Said seven (7) year period of time is found to be reasonable
by the Common Council of the City in view of the appropriate planning and financing
periods for the particular types of Public Facilities for which the Impact Fees are imposed.
28.14 APPEALS.
(a) Notice of appeal. Any developer upon whom an impact fee has been imposed may
contest the amount, collection or use of the impact fee by filing a notice of appeal to

been satisfied, the plumbing or building permit may be issued or the final plan may
be approved. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the collection of the impact fee
due unless a bond or other sufficient surety has been filed.

development, design and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect
of the development of land or provision of capital improvements subject to the zoning and
subdivision regulations or other regulations of the City, which shall be operative and
remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.
28.16 IMPACT FEE AS ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENT. The
impact fees are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other
requirements imposed by the City on the development of land or the issuance of building
permits. The impact fees are intended to be consistent with and to further the objectives
and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, the capital improvements plan, and other City
policies, chapters, and resolutions by which the City seeks to ensure the provision of
public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. In no event shall a property
owner be obligated to pay for capital improvements in an amount in excess of the amount
calculated pursuant to this section; provided however, that a property owner may be
required to pay, pursuant to City ordinances, regulations, or policies, other fees or for other
capital improvements in addition to the impact fees for capital improvements as specified

CHAPTER 32 Adult Entertainment
2 As of 6/5/13
(d) The competitive commercial exploitation of such nudity and semi-nudity is
adverse to the public’s interest and the quality of life, tone of commerce and
total community environment in the City.
(e) The commercial exploitation of nudity and semi-nudity consists of the use of
nude and semi-nude entertainment in connection with or for the promotion of
the sale of goods or services, and the receipt of money by the person
engaging in or promoting the nude or semi-nude entertainment in exchange
for or as consideration for nude or semi-nude performance by such
individuals.
(f) The commercial exploitation of nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions and
nude entertainment frequently occurs at commercial establishments either
selling or allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises.
(g) There is a direct relationship between the consumption of alcoholic
beverages and the nude and semi-nude activities mentioned above and an
increase in criminal activities, moral degradation and the disturbances of the
peace and the good order of the community. The concurrences of these
activities are hazardous to the health and the safety of those persons in
attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and harm
the economic welfare of the community as a whole.
(h) The combination of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with
the performance of nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions and entertainment
is adverse to the public’s interest and the quality of life, tone of commerce
and total community environment in the City.
(i) In order to promote and preserve the public peace and good order and to
safeguard the health, safety, morals and welfare of the community and the
citizens thereof, it is necessary and advisable for the City to prohibit certain
forms of nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions, entertainment and
commercial establishments at which alcoholic beverages are, or are
available to be, sold or consumed.
(j) In order to preserve the public peace and good order and to safeguard the
health, safety, morals and welfare of the community and citizens thereof, it is
necessary and advisable to regulate and restrict the conduct of owners,
operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, patrons, spectators
and persons on the premises of the commercial establishment subject
hereto.
(k) There is a direct relationship between the display or depiction of specified
anatomical areas in subsection (b) 2 and an increase in criminal activities,
moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and good order of the
community and the concurrences of these activities is hazardous to the
CHAPTER 32 Adult Entertainment
3 As of 6/5/13
health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate
the value of adjoining property and harm the economic welfare of the
community as a whole. These secondary effects are adverse to the public’s
interest and quality of life, tone of commerce and total community
environment in the City.
(l) When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are presented in
establishments within the City, other activities which are illegal, immoral or
unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be
aggravated by them. Such other activities include but are not limited to
prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior,
possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or
possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and
property.
(m) When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are present in
establishments within the City, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely
affect neighboring businesses, lower property values, foster an atmosphere
which promotes crime, particularly the kinds detailed in subsection (g) and
ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations.
(n) Physical contact within establishments at which the activities described in
subsections (a) and (b) occur between employees exhibiting specified
anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and
may lead to the spread of communicable and social diseases.
(o) In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the people of the City, it is necessary and advisable for the City to
regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees,
entertainers, performers and customers at establishments where the
activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur.
(p) The potential dangers to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of
the people of the City from the activities described in subsections (a) and (b)
occurring at establishments without first obtaining a license under this article
are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their
being permitted to operate.
(q) “Lap dancing” does not contain any element of communication and is
therefore conduct rather than expression.
(r) “Lap dancing” in establishments poses a threat to the health and safety of
the participants and promotes the spread of communicable and social
diseases.

(s) The Common Council finds that sexually oriented business is frequently
used for unlawful and unhealthy sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaison of a casual nature.
(t) The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health
concern of the City which demands reasonable regulations of sexually
oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
(u) Licensing is a legitimate reasonable means of accountability to ensure that
operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with the reasonable
regulations within this article and to ensure that operators do not knowingly
allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.

dwelling unit. The owner and/or agent shall apply to the office of the Building Inspector for
a license. The application shall contain the name of the owner of the property, address of
the property, address of the owner or agent, type of housing and an address where all
correspondence to the licensee may be mailed. The application shall also include two
phone numbers that can be used to contact the owner or agent regarding issues with the
rental property.
(b) Any owner or agent of residential rental property shall designate an authorized
representative as a contact person with the authority to take action with respect to
the rental property during such times when said owner or agent is not readily
available to make or authorize repairs within a reasonable length of time, and as a
contact in case of emergency.
(c) Unless written notice is otherwise given to the Building Inspector, all mail sent first
class to the licensee at the address stated in the application shall be conclusive as
to its receipt by the licensee.

such unit.

license at the beginning of the tenancy.

a. Class A. Those dwelling units that have complied with the minimum
standards for residential rental property established by this ordinance.
b. Class A-1. Those dwelling units which do not meet the minimum
standards for residential rental property established by this ordinance,
but have only minor infractions that are not practical to correct. Minor
infractions are those which are not a serious health and safety threat
CHAPTER 33 Rental Code
6 As of 10/17/12
to the occupants or to the public and which do not include matters of
safe ingress or egress. Examples of infractions that would cause the
unit to be classified as an A-1 unit rather than an A unit include
having a ceiling height less than 7 feet or having less than 36” aisle
space in a kitchen.
c. Class B. Those dwelling units which do not meet the minimum
standards for residential rental property established by this ordinance
because they require repairs that cannot be completed at the time of
inspection due to the weather or would take an extended period of
time to correct. Examples are properties that require painting, repairs
to siding, foundation or roofing and other similar maintenance or
repair issues.
d. Units which have conditions that are a serious health or safety threat
to the occupants or the public shall not be licensed, rented or
occupied.

a. Class A. Three years;
b. Class A-1. Three years;
c. Class B. One year.
When a unit first becomes licensed, the licensing period shall begin at the
time of the initial licensing inspection, not at the time the license is actually
issued. All licenses as stated above shall expire at the end of such period
unless sooner revoked or suspended. Subsequent licensing periods shall
begin at the expiration date of the previous license. All classifications shall
be reviewed at the beginning of each licensing period by the Building
Inspector and may be reclassified in accordance with this chapter. Class B
licenses for a dwelling unit shall not be issued for more than one year for the
same deficiency.
(3) The inspection and license fee, the payment of which shall be a prerequisite
to issuance of each license, shall be in the amount as established from time
to time by the Common Council.

an additional fee in the amount as established from time
to time by the Common Council will be billed to the property owner.
d. Failure to Allow Inspection. If a property owner or authorized
representative fails to keep a scheduled inspection appointment, an
additional fee in the amount as established from time to time by the
Common Council will be assessed to the owner.

made prior to the issuance of the license for the dwelling unit.
f. Transfer of License. Every person purchasing property previously
licensed desiring to obtain a license on a transfer from a previous
owner shall make application in writing to the Building Inspector
within 7 days of acquisition or shall be subject to the provisions for
inspection as provided for herein.
g. Transfer Fee. A fee in the amount as established from time to time
by the Common Council will be charged to transfer a license from one
property owner to another.
h. Late Fee. A fee in the amount as established from time to time by the
Common Council may be charged to properties that are subject to
the provisions of this ordinance, but have a rental license that has
expired. The fee may be assessed for each day from the date the
license expires until the date a new license is issued.

his or her blood alcohol content level, thus encouraging responsible
behavior while consuming alcohol, providing benefit to both the individual
and the public.

of alcohol, drugs, or another controlled substance, is unconscious or

by the Airport and intended to be used for airport purposes. The District is created
to encompass areas that, due to the operation of aircraft, could be exposed to
excessive noise, are within the aircraft approach and departure areas, or are in areas
which are exposed to a greater risk of aircraft crashes (crash hazard area). The
District is established to protect the approaches to the airport from incompatible land
uses, and to preserve the airport's ability to serve its present and future air
transportation needs. Any expansion, alteration, or enlargement of any building,
structure, or property within this zone must be approved by the Department. The
boundaries of Zone 1 – Airport District are shown on the Airport Zoning Map.

CHAPTER 47
POST-CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
47.01 AUTHORITY
(1) This chapter is adopted by the City of Platteville under the authority granted by
Section 62.234, Wis. Stats.
(2) The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory
powers of the same governing body.
(3) The City of Platteville hereby designates the Director of Public Works to administer
and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
(4) The requirements of this chapter do not pre-empt more stringent storm water
management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits
or approvals including those authorized under ss. 281.16 and 283.33, Wis.
Stats.
(b) Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under s. NR 151.004,
Wis. Adm. Code.
47.02 FINDINGS OF FACT
(1) The City of Platteville acknowledges that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has
a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general
welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural
resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
(a) Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge,
diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature.
(b) Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life,
recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of
sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens
and other urban pollutants.
(c) Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads.
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
3 As of 2/22/17
(d) Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
(e) Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing
storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities.
(f) Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and
levels of flooding.
47.03 PURPOSE AND INTENT
(1) PURPOSE. The general purpose of this chapter is to establish long-term, postconstruction
runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to
public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are
to:
(a) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
(b) Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning
grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of
structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and
promote sound economic growth.
(c) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and
receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; and control
increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter.
(d) Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm
sewer system to protect the waters of the state.
(2) INTENT. It is the intent of the City of Platteville that this chapter regulates postconstruction
storm water discharges to waters of the state. This chapter may be
applied on a site-by-site basis. The City of Platteville recognizes, however, that
the preferred method of achieving the storm water performance standards set
forth in this chapter is through the preparation and implementation of
comprehensive, systems-level storm water management plans that cover
hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such
plans may prescribe regional storm water devices, practices or systems, any of
which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge
to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance
standards developed under s. 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional storm water
management measures and have been approved by the City of Platteville, it is the
intent of this chapter that the approved storm water management plan be used to
identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

in accordance with Section 47.09 shall be developed and implemented for each
post-construction site.
(3) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. For redevelopment sites where the redevelopment
will be replacing older development that was subject to post-construction
performance standards of NR 151 in effect on or after October 1, 2004, the
responsible party shall meet the total suspended solids reduction, peak flow
control, infiltration, and protective areas standards applicable to the older
development or meet the redevelopment standards of this ordinance, whichever is
more stringent.
(4) REQUIREMENTS. The storm water management plan required under sub. (2)
shall include the following:
(a) TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS. BMPs shall be designed, installed and
maintained to control total suspended solids carried in runoff from the postconstruction
site as follows:
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
12 As of 2/22/17
1. BMPs shall be designed in accordance with Table 1. or to the
maximum extent practicable as provided in subd. 2. The design shall
be based on an average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff
management controls.
Table 1. TSS Reduction Standards
Development Type TSS Reduction
New Development 80 percent
In-fill development 80 percent
Redevelopment 40 percent of load from parking areas and
roads
2. Maximum Extent Practicable. If the design cannot meet a total
suspended solids reduction performance standard of Table 1., the
storm water management plan shall include a written, site-specific
explanation of why the total suspended solids reduction performance
standard cannot be met and why the total suspended solids load will
be reduced only to the maximum extent practicable.
3. Off-Site Drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the
BMP from off- site shall be taken into account in determining the
treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the efficiency
shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP
accordingly.
(b) PEAK DISCHARGE.

(c) INFILTRATION.
1. Best Management Practices. BMPs shall be designed, installed,
and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following or
to the maximum extent practicable:
a. Low imperviousness. For development up to 40 percent
connected imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and

volume so that the post- development infiltration volume shall
be at least 90 percent of the pre- development infiltration
volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
requirement, no more than one percent of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective infiltration area.
b. Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than
40 percent and up to 80 percent connected imperviousness,
such as medium and high density residential, multi-family
development, industrial and institutional development, and
office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least 75 percent of
the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average
annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate
infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than 2
percent of the post- construction site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
14 As of 2/22/17
c. High imperviousness. For development with more than 80
percent connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip
malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns,
infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration
systems to meet this requirement, no more than 2 percent of
the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration
area.
2. Pre-development. The pre-development condition shall be the
same as specified in Table 2 of the Peak Discharge section of this
ordinance.
3. Source Areas.
a. Prohibitions. Runoff from the following areas may not be
infiltrated and may not qualify as contributing to meeting the
requirements of this section unless demonstrated to meet the
conditions identified in S. 07 (4)(c)6:

b. Notwithstanding par. a., the discharge from BMPs shall
remain below the enforcement standard at the point of
standards application.
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
17 As of 2/22/17
7. Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be
required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road
construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will
enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to
protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled
maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with
subd. 6. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil
and grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales
or filter strips.
8. Maximum Extent Practicable. Where the conditions of subd. 3. and
4. limit or restrict the use of infiltration practices, the performance
standard of Section 47.07 (4)(c) shall be met to the maximum extent
practicable.
(d) PROTECTIVE AREAS.
1. Definition. In this section, “protective area” means an area of land
that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and
rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the
greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the
top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest
impervious surface. However, in this section, “protective area” does
not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within
a pipe or culvert, so that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this
location.
a. For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource
waters, 75 feet.
b. For perennial identified on a U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-
minute series topographic map, Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources Surface Water Viewer, or a county soil
survey map, whichever is more current, 50 feet.
c. For lakes, 50 feet.
d. For wetlands not subject to par. e. or f., 50 feet.
e. For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible
wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge
meadows, open and coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous
swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds.
f. For less susceptible wetlands, 10 percent of the average
wetland width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet.
Less susceptible wetlands include: degraded wetland
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
18 As of 2/22/17
dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass;
cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged
material or fill material disposal sites that take on the
attributes of a wetland.
g. In pars. d. to f., determinations of the extent of the protective
area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the
sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in
accordance with the standards and criteria in s. NR 103.03.
h. Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance
with s. NR 103.08 (1m). This paragraph does not apply to
wetlands that have been completely filled in compliance with
all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective
area for wetlands that have been partially filled in compliance
with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be
measured from the wetland boundary delineation after a fill
has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland
fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that
location.
i. For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater
than 130 acres, 10 feet.
j. Notwithstanding pars. a. to i., the greatest protective area
width shall apply where rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands
are contiguous.
2. Applicability. This section applies to post-construction sites located
within a protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to
subd. 4.Requirements. The following requirements shall be met:
a. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area
entirely or to the maximum extent practicable. If there is no
practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the
protective area, the storm water management plan shall
contain a written, site-specific explanation.
b. Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a
protective area, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative
cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and
maintained where no impervious surface is present. The
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish
habitat, and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow
areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials,
such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
19 As of 2/22/17
necessary to prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or
where high velocity flows occur.
c. BMPs such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention ponds,
that are designed to control pollutants from non-point
sources, may be located in the protective area.
3. Exemptions. This section does not apply to any of the following:
a. Except as provided under Section 47.07 (3), redevelopment
post-construction sites.
b. In-fill development areas less than 5 acres.
c. Structures that cross or access surface water such as boat
landings, bridges, and culverts.
d. Structures constructed in accordance with s. 59.692 (1v),
Stats.
e. Areas of post-construction sites from which the runoff does
not enter the surface water, including wetlands, without first
being treated by a BMP to meet the local chapter
requirements for total suspended solids and peak flow
reduction, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is
necessary to maintain bank stability.
(e) FUELING AND MAINTENANCE AREAS. Fueling and vehicle maintenance
areas shall have BMPs designed, installed, and maintained to reduce
petroleum within runoff, so that the runoff that enters waters of the state
contains no visible petroleum sheen, or to the maximum extent practicable.
(f) SWALE TREATMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.
1. Requirement. Except as provided in subd. 2., transportation facilities
that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal are
exempt from the requirements of local chapter requirements for peak
flow control, total suspended solids control, and infiltration, if the
swales are designed to do all of the following or to the maximum
extent practicable:
a. Swales shall be vegetated. However, where appropriate, nonvegetative
measures may be employed to prevent erosion or
provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization
or check dams.
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
20 As of 2/22/17
b. Swales shall comply with sections V.F. (Velocity and Depth)
and V.G. (Swale Geometry Criteria) with a swale treatment
length as long as that specified in section V.C. (Pre-
Treatment) of the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources technical standard 1005 “Vegetated Infiltration
Swales”, dated May 2007, or a superseding document.
Transportation facility swale treatment does not have to
comply with other sections of technical standard 1005.
2. Other requirements.
a. Notwithstanding subd. 1., the Director of Public Works may,
consistent with water quality standards, require that other
requirements, in addition to swale treatment, be met on a
transportation facility with an average daily traffic rate greater
than 2,500 and where the initial surface water of the state that
the runoff directly enters is one of the following:
i. An outstanding resource water.
ii. An exceptional resource water.
iii. Waters listed in section 303 (d) of the Federal Clean
Water Act that are identified as impaired in whole or in
part, due to non-point source impacts.
iv. Water where targeted performance standards are
developed pursuant to s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm.
Code.
b. The transportation facility authority shall contact the Director
of Public Works to determine if additional BMPs beyond a
water quality swale are needed under this subsection.
(5) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
MEASURES. The following considerations shall be observed in on-site and offsite
runoff management:
(a) Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural
depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater
recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet
the requirements of this section.
(b) Emergency overland flow for all storm water facilities shall be provided to
prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and
prevent endangerment of downstream property or public safety.
(6) BMP LOCATION.
CHAPTER 47 Post-Construction Storm Water Management

approved by the City of Platteville and that contains management
requirements consistent with the purpose and intent of this
ordinance.
2. The off-site facility meets all of the following conditions:
a. The facility is in place.
b. The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a
level of storm water control equal to or greater than that which
would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the
performance standards of this ordinance.
c. The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its
long-term operation and maintenance.
(c) Where a regional treatment option exists such that the Director of Public
Works exempts the applicant from all or part of the minimum on-site storm
water management requirements, the applicant shall be required to pay a
fee in an amount determined in negotiation with the Director of Public
Works. In determining the fee for post-construction runoff, the Director of
Public Works shall consider an equitable distribution of the cost for land,
engineering design, construction, and maintenance of the regional
treatment option.
(7) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS. The Director of Public Works may establish
storm water management requirements more stringent than those set forth in this
chapter if the Director of Public Works determines that the requirements are
needed to control storm water quantity or control flooding, comply with federally
approved total maximum daily load requirements, or control pollutants associated
with existing development or redevelopment.

CHAPTER 48
STORM SEWER ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION
48.01 PURPOSE
(1) AUTHORITY
(a) The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Platteville through the
regulation of non-storm water discharges to the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) to the maximum extent practicable as required by
federal and state law. This chapter establishes methods for controlling the
introduction of pollutants into the MS4 in order to comply with
requirements of the Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(WPDES) permit process. The objectives of this chapter are:
1. To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by storm water
discharges by any user.
2. To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4.
3. To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance,
monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
(b) The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful
regulatory powers of the City.
(c) In instances where the provisions of this ordinance conflict with provisions
of other City ordinances, zoning regulation, or the provisions of state
agencies, including, but not limited to, the WPDES Storm Water Discharge
Permits issued by the WDNR under Wis. Stats. Section 281.31, the more
stringent provision shall apply.
(d) The City designates the Director of Public Works as the person
responsible to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Ultimate Responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant
to this ordinance are minimum standards; therefore, this chapter does not intend
or imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no
contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
(3) Findings of Fact. The City is growing at a rapid rate. The Rountree Branch River
and its tributaries are valuable trout waters of regional significance, representing

prevent further or continuing discharge of pollutants to the MS4 and
watercourses. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which
is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at
said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent
the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid WPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm
water management plan (SWMP)/storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)

hereunder, the Director of Public Works may serve upon that person a written
warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and
requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a
resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or
resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the
alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Director
of Public Works to take action, including emergency action or any other
enforcement action without first issuing a warning notice.
(4) Notice of Violation. Whenever the Director of Public Works finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the
Director of Public Works may order compliance by written notice of violation to
the responsible person. The notice of violation shall contain:
(a) The name and address of the alleged violator;
(b) The address when available or a description of the building, structure or
land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
(c) A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
(d) A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance

within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or contractor and the expense thereof
shall be charged to the violator.
Such notice may require without limitation:
1. The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
CHAPTER 48 Storm Sewer Illicit Discharge and Connection
11 As of 2/22/17
2. The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
3. That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
4. The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected premises;
5. Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
6. Preparing plans for and implementing BMPs.
(5) Suspension of MS4 Access.
(a) Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director of Public Works
finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past
violations are likely to reoccur, and that the person's violation(s) has
(have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the
MS4 or waters of the State which reasonably appears to present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons
or to the environment, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to
the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the violator to: reoccur, and that the person's violation(s) has
(have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the
MS4 or waters of the state which reasonably appears to present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons
or to the environment, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to
the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the violator to:
1. Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
2. Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this
subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the Director of Public Works may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the
MS4 or waters of state, and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The Director of Public
Works may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has
CHAPTER 48 Storm Sewer Illicit Discharge and Connection
12 As of 2/22/17
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination
proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A
person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Public
Works within five business days of receipt of the emergency order as a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the violator.
(b) Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
Director of Public Works may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails
to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Director of
Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger
to persons.
(c) Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The Director of Public Works will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
Director of Public Works for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of
the Director of Public Works.
(d) Prosecution and Penalties. Any person that has violated or continues to
violate this chapter shall be liable to prosecution to the fullest extent of the
law. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures
set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations
described therein within the set time period specified by the Director of
Public Works, after he/she has taken one or more of the actions described
above, such person shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100
nor more than $1,000 in addition to the costs of prosecution and any
penalty assessment imposed by Wisconsin Statutes. Each day a violation
exists shall constitute a separate offense. The Director of Public Works
may also impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such
as storm drain stenciling/marking, attendance at compliance workshops,
pond or drainage way cleanup, etc.
CHAPTER 48 Storm Sewer Illicit Discharge and Connection
13 As of 2/22/17
(6) Cost of Abatement of the Violation. Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the
violation, the owner of the premises will be notified of the cost of abatement,
including administrative costs. If the amount due is not paid by the date
determined by the City, the charges shall become a special charge against the
property, and shall constitute a lien on the property, per Section 66.0628, Wis.
Stats. The City may recover all attorneys' fees court costs and other expenses
associated with enforcement of this ordinance, including sampling and monitoring
expenses.

ORDINANCE CREATING A FEDERAL
REVENUE SHARING SECTION 504
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE FOR
THE CITY OF PLATTEVILLE
The Common Council of the City of Platteville do ordain as follows:
Section 1. An ordinance creating a Federal Revenue Sharing Section 504
Grievance Procedure is hereby created as follows:
SECTION 504 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Required under revenue sharing regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2)).
The City of Platteville has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the Office
of Revenue Sharing’s (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2)) implementing Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (27 U.S.C. 794). Section 504 states, in part,
that “no otherwise qualified handicapped individual. . . shall, solely by reason of his
handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected
to discrimination under any program or actively receiving federal financial assistance. . .”
Complaints should be addressed to: Merle Strouse, City Manager, City Hall, 75
North Bonson Street, P.O. Box 252, Platteville, WI 53818, (608) 348-9741, who has been
designated to coordinate Section 504 compliance efforts.
1. A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and
address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.
2. A complaint should be filed within 10 days after the complainant becomes
aware of the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring
before this grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis).
3. An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a complaint.
The investigation will be conducted by Merle Strouse. These rules contemplate informal
but thorough investigations, affording all interested persons and their representatives, if
any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a complaint. Under 31 C.F.R.
51.55(d)(2), the City of Platteville need not process complaints from applicants for
employment or from applicants for admission to post-secondary educational institutions.
15
4. A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of
resolution, if any, shall be issued by Merle Strouse and a copy forwarded to the
complainant no later than 20 days after its filing.
5. The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the City
of Platteville relating to the complaints filed.
6. The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances
where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for reconsideration should
be made within 30 days to Platteville Common Council.
7. The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint
filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person’s pursuit of other remedies such as the
filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of
the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of
other remedies.
8. These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested
persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the City of
Platteville complies with Section 504 and the ORS regulations.
Section 2. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage
and publication as required by law.
