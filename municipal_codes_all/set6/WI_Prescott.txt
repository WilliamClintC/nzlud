Purpose. This section is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with lawns,grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the City of Prescott.

For that reason, anynonagricultural lawn, grass or weed on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds eight inches inlength is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except for property located in a designatedfloodplain area and/or wetland area or where the lawn, grass or weed is part of a natural lawnapproved pursuant to §

§ 356-15. Nudity in licensed establishments.
Findings.
The Wisconsin Statutes authorize local municipalities to prescribe regulations for the sale ofalcoholic beverages which are not in conflict with state statutes.
The City of Prescott Common Council upon due consideration finds that nudity and nearnudity and sexual conduct are proper subjects for regulation in connection with the control ofthe sale of alcoholic beverages within the City.
The Common Council further finds that any form of nudity coupled with alcohol consumptionin a public place begets undesirable behavior and that there is a relationship between theconsumption of alcoholic beverages and nudity and an increase of criminal activities, moraldegradation and the disturbances of the peace and the good order of the community.Concurrence of nudity and alcoholic beverages is hazardous to the health and the safety ofthose in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and to harm theeconomic welfare of the community as a whole. When there is concurrence of nudity andconsumption of alcoholic beverages, other activities that are illegal, immoral or unhealthy tendto accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such otheractivities include but are not limited to prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd andlascivious behavior, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale orpossession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property.
The Common Council has determined that the enactment of an ordinance prohibiting nudityand sexual conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the City ofPrescott will prevent or limit such undesirable conduct and activities.
Improper exhibitions. It shall be unlawful for any person to perform, or for any licensee or manageror agent of the licensee to permit any employee, entertainer or patron to engage in any live act,demonstration, dance or exhibition on the licensed premises which:
Exposes his or her genitals, pubic hair, buttocks, perineum, anal region or pubic hair region;or
Exposes any device, costume or covering which gives the appearance of or simulatesgenitals, pubic hair, buttocks, perineum, anal region or pubic hair region; or
Exposes any portion of the female breast at or below the areola thereof; or
Engages or simulates sexual intercourse and/or any sexual contact, including the touching ofany portion of the female breast or the male and/or female genitals.

If the application is denied by the Common Council, the City Clerk shall, in writing, informthe applicant of the denial, the reasons therefor, and of the opportunity to request areconsideration of the application by the Common Council in a closed session. Suchnotice must be sent by registered mail to, or served upon, the applicant at least 10 daysprior to the Council's reconsideration of the matter. At such reconsideration hearing, theapplicant may present evidence and testimony as to why the license should be granted.

Considerations.
Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based on:
Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by§§ 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335, Wis. Stats.;
The financial responsibility of the applicant; and
Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed.
If a licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to the licensed activity, theCommon Council may act to revoke or suspend the license.
An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if theapplicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant hashabitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been alaw offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenseswhich are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediatelypreceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is aright granted solely to the Common Council, the Common Council reserves the right toconsider the severity, and facts and circumstances of the offense when making thedetermination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Common Council, at itsdiscretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or more offenses which aresubstantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding, act tosuspend such license for a period of one year or more.

§ 435-30. Findings and intent.
The Common Council finds that repeat sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexualoffenders who prey on children are sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the publicsafety.

This makes the cost of sexual offender victimizationto society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
It is not the intent of the Common Council to punish sex offenders but rather to serve the City'scompelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizensof the City of Prescott by prohibiting certain sexual offenders from being present, loitering, andresiding in or near locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers.

Article III. Chronic Nuisance Premises
[Adopted
8-8-2016
by
Ord. No. 03-16
]
§ 443-12. Findings.
The Prescott Common Council finds that certain premises within the City receive and require morethan the general, acceptable level of police services, place an undue and inappropriate burden on Cityof Prescott taxpayers, and constitute public nuisances. Nuisance activity contributes to the generaldecay of an affected neighborhood and negatively impacts law-abiding residents in theseneighborhoods. The vast majority of properties with chronic nuisance activity are nonowner occupied.This article is enacted to encourage premises owners to recognize their responsibility to ensure thatactivities occurring on their premises conform to the law and do not unduly burden the City's policeresources, and to provide a mechanism for the City to take action against premises owners who fail toensure premises they own do not require a disproportionate level of police resources to be devoted tosuch premises. This article provides a method for police to use in a progressive manner when workingwith property owners to abate nuisance activities occurring on their premises. Therefore, the CommonCouncil determines that the City will charge the owners of such premises with the costs associatedwith abating nuisance activity at premises where nuisance activities chronically occur. This section isnot intended to discourage crime victims or a person in legitimate need of police services fromrequesting them.

The control manhole shall beinstalled at the most representative location of the waste water flow for the industrial user. Thecontrol manhole shall be installed and maintained by the industrial user at the user's expense. Thecontrol manhole shall be maintained by the industrial user so as to be safe and accessible at alltimes. The industrial user may be required to install temporary or permanent flow sampling andmetering equipment at the discretion of the City. If so required, the cost for installation, operation,and maintenance of such equipment will be at the expense of the industrial user.
All significant industrial users discharging industrial waste water to the sewerage system shallinstall a control manhole in accordance with Ch. COMM 82 Wis. Adm. Code. The control manholeshall be installed at the most representative location of the waste water flow for the significantindustrial user. The control manhole shall consist of a manhole on the industrial users dischargeline with a volume measuring device and a separate structure housing volume recordinginstruments and an automatic proportional sampler. The sampler shall automatically (in proportionto the discharge volume) collect samples of the waste water. The control manhole structure,volume measuring devices, and waste sampling devices, shall be approved by the DNR and theCity prior to installation. The significant industrial user shall install, operate, and maintain thecontrol manhole, metering facilities, and sampling facilities at its own expense.

specified in § 62.234, Wis. Stats., § 62.23, Wis. Stats., applies to this article and to anyamendments to this article.
The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the City.
The Common Council hereby designates the City Zoning Administrator, with assistance from theCity Engineer, to administer and enforce the provisions of this article.
The requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent stormwater managementrequirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvalsincluding those authorized under §§ 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
Other City ordinances and zoning regulations.
§ 500-15. Findings of fact.
The Common Council finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact uponwater resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the publicenjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour,diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing streamtemperature.
Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and watersupply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavymetals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.
Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities.
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks andvolumes.
Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.
§ 500-16. Purpose and intent.
Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term, post-construction runoffmanagement requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and theaquatic environment. Specific purposes are to:
Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion;prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control

building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenicbeauty; and promote sound economic growth.
Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving waterbodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportationof particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property.
Intent. It is the intent of the Common Council that this article regulates post-constructionstormwater discharges within the City and to waters of the state. This article may be applied on asite-by-site basis. The Common Council recognizes, however, that the preferred method ofachieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is through the preparationand implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that coverhydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans mayprescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed totreat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans arein conformance with the performance standards developed under § 281.16, Wis. Stats., forregional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the Common Council, itis the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify post-constructionmanagement measures acceptable for the community.
§ 500-17. Applicability and jurisdiction.
Applicability.
Where not otherwise limited by law, this article applies after final stabilization to a site of landdevelopment or land disturbing activity of any size, which changes the predevelopmenthydrology and/or increases the rate of volume of runoff, or the thermal, chemical, or sedimentloading leaving the site beyond the conditions that existed prior to any planned landdevelopment or land disturbing activity.
A site that meets any of the criteria in this subsection is exempt from the requirements of thisarticle:
Routine maintenance for project sites under five acres of land disturbance if performed tomaintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility.
Underground utility construction such as water, sewer and fiberoptic lines. Thisexemption does not apply to the construction of any aboveground structures associatedwith utility construction.
Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in Subsection
A(1)
, this article applies to post-construction sites of any size that, in the opinion of the administering authority, is likely toresult in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receivingbody of water, that causes undue channel erosion, that increases water pollution by scouringor the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property or public safety.
The City Zoning Administrator, with assistance of the City Engineer, may establish on-sitestormwater management requirements less stringent than those set forth herein, providedthat provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility, provided that all of thefollowing conditions for the off-site facility are met:
The off-site facility is operational prior to commencing the proposed land development orland disturbing activity.
The off-site facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwatercontrol equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meetingthe requirements of this article.

Failure to effectively manage stormwateraffects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the City by, among other things, increasing the likelihoodof infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause erosion oflands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage tothe rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the City. A system for thecollection and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the City of Prescott andsurrounding areas, including those properties not currently served by the system. The cost of operatingand maintaining the City stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs,replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated inrelationship to the services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfareof the public, the Common Council hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility andestablish the rates for stormwater management services.

§ 510-8. Condominium developments.
Purpose.
The City of Prescott Common Council hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominiumdevelopments that require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments.The State Legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply tocondominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiumsthat are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to adeclaration of condominium.
The factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creationof multiple, distinct property entities at or near the ground surface, subject to property taxation

as separate "parcels," with each property entity having different ownership and management.The City determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, bothphysically and in ownership, from developments in which the land and improvements areunder unitary ownership, management, and control.
Thus, the Common Council hereby finds that new condominium developments can placeimpacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which arecharacterized by division of land into lots. These impacts include:
Additional population density.
Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the land's characteristics.
Additional demands upon City area parks, recreation areas, utility facilities and schools.
Additional traffic and street use.
Portions of chapter applicable to condominium developments. The following sections of thischapter shall apply to condominium developments:

Article X. Variances; Violations and Penalties
§ 510-51. Variations and exceptions.
Where the subdivider alleges that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result fromstrict compliance with these regulations, he may request variations or exceptions to theregulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided thatsuch variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of thischapter. Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the subdivider to the CityClerk at the time when the preliminary plat or certified survey is filed for consideration, stating fullyall facts relied upon by the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or otheradditional data which may aid City officials in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans forsuch development shall include such covenants, restrictions or other legal provisions necessary toguarantee the full achievement of the plan. The City Clerk may request that the City Engineer, CityAttorney or other officials review each situation to insure that the request is consistent with therequirements and standards of this chapter. The City Clerk shall refer the matter to the PlanCommission with a written report and recommendation from City staff. The previous granting ofvariances or exceptions in the same or similar circumstances shall not of itself constitute groundsfor the granting of a variance or exception, nor shall strictly financial rationale.
The Common Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to the regulations of this chapterunless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
Failure to grant the variation may be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare orinjurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property islocated.
The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property forwhich the variation is sought and are not applicable generally to other property.
Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of thespecific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguishedfrom a mere inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship, if the strict letter ofthe regulations were carried out.
There would be no costs (present or future) to the City resulting from the granting of thevariance or exception.
Any recommendations for variances or exceptions by the Plan Commission must be approved bya 3/4 majority vote of the Plan Commission and shall be so endorsed by the Secretary andtransmitted to the Common Council. The Common Council, if it approves, shall do so by resolutionadopted by 3/4 vote and shall instruct the City Clerk to notify the Plan Commission and thesubdivider.
Variances from the strict application of this chapter may also be granted in accordance with thischapter in the case of planned unit developments, provided that the Common Council, uponreview and recommendations from the Plan Commission, shall find that the proposeddevelopment is fully consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, City zoning ordinances,

§ 600-5. General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional floodor base flood. [Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the FloodInsurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered bythe base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.]
Official maps and revisions.
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on themaps listed below and the revisions in the City of Prescott Floodplain Appendix. Any changeto the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the FloodInsurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before itis effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall beeffective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of theZoning Administrator of the City of Prescott. If more than one map or revision is referenced,the most restrictive information shall apply.
Official maps based on the FIS: Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers55093C00095E, 55093C0231E and 55093C0232E dated November 16, 2011, withcorresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated November16, 2011, Volume Number 55093CV000A, approved by the DNR and FEMA.
Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of thefloodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limitsand the floodway.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered byfloodwater during the regional flood.
Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official FloodplainZoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection
D(1)
or
(2)
below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Article
VIII
. TheZoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny aland use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall beresponsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which thedistrict boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under thissection. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundaryline shall be settled according to §
600-27C
and the criteria in Subsection
D(1)
and
(2)
below.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the districtboundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.[Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM,FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to §
600-31F
.]
Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the mapscale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.
Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not begrounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regionalor base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map isamended pursuant to Article
VIII
. [Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the

mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request aLetter of Map Change (LOMC).]
Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be incompliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federalregulations.
Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities,villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessarypermits.
Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under§ 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is morerestrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extentof the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions,covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of thischapter shall prevail.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are theminimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitationon or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light ofthe standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of themost recent text amendment to this chapter.
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this chapter are based onengineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height maybe increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nordoes this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or anyofficer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.
Annexed areas. The Pierce County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexationshall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until themunicipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis.Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands aredescribed on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions areincorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this subsection and are on file in theoffice of the municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show theregional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.
General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determinewhether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site isin a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed ormodified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of thestructure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materialsresistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages;and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipmentand other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering oraccumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewedfor compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured homeparks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets thesubdivision definition of this chapter.

The structural erosion control measure is constructed of natural materials and is made as visuallyinconspicuous as possible.
The person seeking to construct the structural erosion control measure submits a detailedconstruction plan, an erosion control plan and a vegetative management plan, showing how thestructural erosion control measure will be constructed, what land disturbing activities will takeplace, what, if any, vegetation will be removed, and how new, native vegetation will bereestablished. Construction may not proceed until the City has approved the plans.
§ 606-16. Slope preservation zone standards.
No structures, except piers, wharves, structural erosion control measures, stairways and lifts, may beplaced in slope preservation zones. Slopes greater than 12% may not be altered to become less than12%.
§ 606-17. Vegetation management.
Goals. All of the following goals apply to all management zones:
The primary goals of these vegetative management provisions are to screen structures tomake them visually inconspicuous and to prevent erosion and disturbance of environmentallysensitive areas such as steep slopes, shorelines and bluff top areas.
A secondary goal is to maintain and restore historically and ecologically significant plantcommunities and enhance diversity.
Vegetative screening of structures takes priority over restoration and maintenance ofsignificant plant communities.
Successional climax forest and pre-settlement disturbed oak savanna are the preferred forestecotype examples of significant plant communities.
Standards. The purpose of vegetative management standards is to prevent erosion, protectground water, prevent surface water contamination and to lessen the visual impact of existingstructures and new and expanded structures. The following vegetation management standardsapply in all management zones, except where more stringent specific overlay district standardsexpressly apply:
Vegetation in ordinary high-water-mark setback areas, slope preservation zones and 40 feetlandward of blufflines shall be left undisturbed, except as provided elsewhere in thissubsection or in §§
606-23
,
606-24
and
606-29
for transmission services, wirelesscommunication facilities or roads.
Vegetation may not be disturbed or removed if it would disrupt the visually inconspicuouscharacter of structures, reduce the quality or diversity of the plant community, or increase thepotential for erosion, except as provided elsewhere in this subsection or in §§
606-23
,
606-24
and
606-29
for transmission services, wireless communication facilities or roads.
Routine pruning of trees or shrubs to improve their health and vigor, pruning to provide afiltered view of the river, pruning to prevent property damage, and removing trees that posean imminent safety hazard to persons or structures is allowed.
Lawns within ordinary high-water-mark setbacks areas, slope preservation zones and blufflinesetback areas shall not be expanded. Mowing of existing lawns may be continued.

§ 635-30. Planned Unit Development District PUD.
Purpose.
The Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is intended to accommodate areas ofintegrated mixed land uses, innovative lot sizes and physical design and strong commitmentsto commonly held open space. It is intended that PUDs will be developed as integratedprojects with the lot sizes and configurations, street layout and design standards, and buildingconstruction and placement all done to the standards of a master plan prepared by thedeveloper. This plan would be subject to review and approval by the Plan Commission.Recommendations for alterations of the plan both before and after Plan Commission approvalwould be worked out with the developer or property owners' association.
Lot ownership within the PUD could be held by a single owner as an apartment/retailcomplex; by a nonprofit corporation as a residents association; or by a combination of privatesingle-family/commercial lots and condominium buildings, and commonly held open spaces.
The ownership of streets, public utilities and improved and unimproved open space isnegotiable, sometimes remaining with the developer or owners' association and sometimes inall or in part being accepted by the City.
Principal permitted uses.
Residential uses of various types and densities, mixed and located within the developmentbased on the project's master plan.
Commercial retail and office uses mixed and located singly or in conjunction with other usesin accordance with the master plan.
Industrial uses, generally considered to be "light" industry, or assembly operations to beintegrated into the overall project in accordance with the master plan.
Recreational uses, which could include, but not limited to, such indoor recreational uses ascommunity halls, bowling alleys, gymnasiums or fitness centers, indoor swimming pools andtheaters and outdoor recreational facilities, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, hard-surfaced play courts, golf courses, archery ranges, playground equipment, landscaped andturf-covered open areas and natural areas, such as wooded hillsides, meadows, marshes andponds.
Agricultural uses, including the keeping of livestock, could be permitted, provided such use isan integrated part of the project's master plan. Presumably, the area designated foragricultural use at the time of the PUD's initial development would be intended for long-rangefuture development to a more intensive use. This long-range intention for agricultural landsshould be part of the master plan presented to the Plan Commission for approval.
Accessory uses. All buildings and uses normally considered accessory to the approved principaluses. This includes structures necessary to provide the PUD with public utilities, such as pumphouses, lift stations, transformer banks, etc.
Conditional uses. All uses, including those listed previously as "permitted" are actually conditionalbased upon the Plan Commission's approval of the project master plan. All intended uses must beincluded in the master plan by the developer. Home occupations as defined in this chapter will notbe considered a use by right within housing units within the PUD.
Prohibited uses. All uses not presented in the approved master plan.
Minimum area. The minimum size for any single planned unit development will be three acres.

Q.
Lot size. Individual lots within the planned unit development may be proportionately downsizedfrom the equivalent lot size required for that use in the other zoning districts, provided such lotsare not reduced below 50% of the size permitted in other appropriate districts. For example, asingle-family lot could be 4,250 square feet based on a residential district single-family lot size of8,500 square feet. In certain commercial mall or townhouse developments, the R-2 (MF) or R-3(HD) lot size would be taken as the basis upon which to make the reduction.
Open space. For all PUDs, usable open space encompassing a minimum of 30% of the total PUDarea shall be provided. Usable open space shall be defined as lands used for intensive residentrecreational use, such as picnicking, hiking, playgrounds, ball fields, etc. Wetlands and steep rockhillsides are not considered as usable open space where general recreation activities can occur.Usable open space shall also be in usable shapes and sizes to permit maintenance and policingand will not just be limited to odd corners and street islands left over after development iscompleted. Ultimate ownership and maintenance of the common open spaces shall be negotiablebetween the City, the developer and the property owners within the development.
Minimum yards.
Front. Frontage width may be reduced to 50% of the frontage that would be required for thesame use in the appropriate conventional zoning district. Frontage depth shall permitresidential buildings to be constructed at the front lot line, except no building shall be closerthan 20 feet from the curb or edge of pavement from a local internal PUD street. Regularsetbacks shall apply to streets designated by the City or state as collectors or arterials.
Rear. Buildings may be permitted at the rear lot line in accordance with the master plan.
Side. Buildings may be permitted at the side lot line in accordance with the master plan.
Minimum dwelling unit size: 500 square feet.
Building height. Building heights will be negotiated as part of the master plan approval process.
Maximum lot coverage: no more than 70%.
Drainage and erosion control. The provisions of the City Code pertaining to erosion control shallapply.
[1]
The developer shall be responsible for the initial installation to City standards of all stormdrainage structures and water runoff retention structures within the limits of the PUD.
Editor's Note: See Ch.
500
, Stormwater Management and Erosion Control.
Percent slope. All slope modifications shall be indicated on the master plan and shall be subject tonegotiation and approval by the Plan Commission.
Performance standards. All uses of land, water and structures in this district must also comply withArticle
VIII
.
Street standards. Internal streets and access roads within the PUD shall be negotiated as part ofthe master plan approval process. It is suggested by this chapter that certain width and curvestandards that might otherwise be demanded in a conventional plat might be negotiated if anintegrated master plan shows certain roads will never serve a function other than local residentialaccess.
Relationship to other uses. The layout of any PUD, especially those that will have mixed landuses, such as single-family and high-density multifamily or commercial and recreational uses, willbe sensitive to the existing or potential land uses in conventional zoning district adjacent to thePUD.

The purpose of a conditional use permit is to provide a reasonable degree of discretion in determiningthe suitability of certain uses of a special nature, so as to make impractical their predetermination as aprincipal use in a district. The development and execution of this article is based upon the division ofthe City into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location ofbuildings and structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform.However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properlyclassified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, ineach case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public needfor the particular use of a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirableto be allowed in a particular district, provided that due consideration is given to location, developmentand operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses, and are those usesspecifically designated as conditional uses by the zoning district or which are classified as a conditionaluse under the review procedures in this article.
§ 635-35. Authority of Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize the Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional usepermit after review and public hearing, provided that such conditional use and involvedstructure(s) are found to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and arefurther found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment or

§ 635-117. Variances.
Purpose.
A request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strictadherence to the provisions of this Zoning Code would cause him undue hardship or createconditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition. A variance granted to anonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoningrequirements.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variancefrom the terms of the Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owingto special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Code will result inunnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of the Zoning Code shall be observed andsubstantial justice done. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district usesprohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection that the flood protectionelevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
For the purposes of this section, "unnecessary hardship" shall be defined as an unusual orextreme decrease in the adaptability of the property to the uses permitted by the zoningdistrict which is caused by facts, such as rough terrain or good soil conditions, uniquelyapplicable to the particular piece of property as distinguished from those applicable to most orall property in the same zoning district.
Application for variances. The application for variation shall be filed with the City Clerk.Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land or water to be affected.The application shall contain the following information:

Additional information required by the Plan Commission, City Engineer, Board of ZoningAppeals or Zoning Administrator.
Public hearing of application. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct at least one publichearing on the proposed variation. Notice of such hearing shall be given not more than 30 daysand not less than seven days before the hearing in one or more of the newspapers in generalcirculation in the City, and shall give due notice to the parties in interest, the Zoning Administratorand the Plan Commission. At the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in person, byagent or by attorney. The Board shall thereafter reach its decision within 30 days after the finalhearing and shall transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant, ZoningAdministrator and Plan Commission.
Action of the Zoning Board of Appeals. For the Board to grant a variance, it must find that:
Denial of variation may result in hardship to the property owner due to physiographicalconsideration. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances orconditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use or intended use that do not applygenerally to other properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the variancewould not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that the Zoning Code should bechanged.
The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property forwhich variation is being sought and that such variance is necessary for the preservation andenjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same districtand same vicinity.
The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value orincome potential of the property.
The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to theother property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
The proposed variation will not undermine the spirit and general and specific purposes of theZoning Code.
Conditions. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon thepremises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards establishedin this section.
§ 635-118. Review by court of record.
