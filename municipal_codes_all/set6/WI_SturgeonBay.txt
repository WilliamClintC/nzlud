PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as supplemented through Ord. No. 960-1095, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is a decimal numbering system. The figure before the decimal refers to the chapter number, and the figures after the decimal refer to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.02, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6.01. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6.01 and 6.02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6.011. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(b)  Revocation. The police department is authorized and directed to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in violation of this section; and upon written notification thereof, the permit holder shall surrender such permit to the police department.

(a)  Where undeveloped areas abut developed lots, a minimum distance of 100 feet from the developed lot shall be cut.

This cost shall be entered on the tax roll as a special tax to be collected in the same manner as other taxes. The property owner shall notify the weed commissioner of compliance with the notice; failure to do so within the five-day period renders compliance null and void.

10.34. - Sexual offender residency restrictions. 
(1)  Findings and purpose. The state statues provide for the punishment, treatment and supervision of person convicted or otherwise responsible for sex crimes against children, including their release into the community. 
    Chapter 980, Wis. Stats. provides for the civil commitment of sexually violent persons, a more dangerous type of sex offender due to their likelihood to reoffend, and specifically, in § 980.08, Wis. Stats. provides for the supervised release of such persons into the community. 
    The city places a high priority on maintaining public safety through highly skilled and trained law enforcement and laws that deter and punish criminal behavior. 
    The city finds that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and as reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and daycare centers. The city finds that, in addition to schools and daycare centers, children congregate or play in a number of public places, including public parks and houses of worship. 
    This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at limiting those sex offenders placed in the city to individuals who committed the offense in the city. 
    Further, this chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the city from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend following placement in the community. It is the purpose of this chapter not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the city's compelling interest in promoting, protect and improving the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from loitering or prowling.

(1)  Intent and purpose; Dutch elm disease and elm bark beetles declared public nuisance. The common council has determined that there are many elm trees growing on public and private premises within the City of Sturgeon Bay, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of public and private premises and erode the tax base of the city, and that the health and life of such trees is threatened by a fatal disease known as Dutch elm disease, which is spread by the elm bark beetles, Scolytus multistriatus (Eichb.) or Hylurgopinus rufipes (Marsh.), and the council hereby declares its intention to control and prevent the spread of such disease and the insect pests and vectors which carry such disease and declares Dutch elm disease and the elm bark beetles which carry such disease to be public nuisances.

When any residue or concentrate from municipal spraying operations can be expected to be deposited on any public street, the board shall also notify the chief of police, who shall take all necessary steps to make and enforce temporary parking and traffic regulations on such streets as conditions require. Temporary "no parking" notices shall be posted in each block of any affected street at least 24 hours in advance of spraying operations.

At minimum, all properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a ten-year interval. The utility may, but is not required to, perform the cross-connection inspection of the owner's property. If, in the opinion of the utility, the utility is not able to perform the inspection, the property owner must, at their own expense, have the plumbing inspected for cross-connections by a State of Wisconsin Certified Cross-Connection inspector/surveyor or by a State of Wisconsin licensed plumber. The frequency of required inspections and reinspections, based on potential health hazards involved, may be shortened by the utility. The utility shall charge fees as approved by the State of Wisconsin Public Service Commission for on-premises follow-up visits by utility personnel for reinspection due to customer noncompliance and for after-hours inspections or reinspections. 
(5)  Right of entry. Upon presentation of credentials, representatives of the utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property served by a connection to the public water system of the utility for cross-connection. If entry is refused, such representatives shall obtain a special inspection warrant under § 66.0119, Wis. Stats. Upon request, the owner, lessor, or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system on such property. 
(6)  Authority to discontinue service. The utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section exists and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any damage of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued if the means of backflow prevention required by the utility is not installed, tested, maintained, and repaired in compliance with this ordinance and Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811 or if it is found that the means of backflow prevention required by this ordinance has been removed or bypassed. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., except as provided in subsection (7) of this section. 
(7)  Reconnection of service. Water service to any property discontinued under the provisions of this section shall not be restored until the cross-connection has been eliminated or a backflow prevention device approved by the utility has been installed in compliance with the provisions of this section. The utility shall charge fees as approved by the State of Wisconsin Public Service Commission for the reconnection of the water service. 
(8)  Emergency discontinuance of service. If it is determined by the utility that a cross-connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate action, service may be immediately discontinued. The owner, lessee, or occupant shall have an opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., within ten days of such emergency discontinuance. Such hearing shall be before the utility commission and shall conform to all existing due process requirements. 
(9)  Owner responsibility. The property owner shall be responsible for the elimination of or protection from all cross-connections on their premises. The owner shall, at their expense, have installed, maintained, and tested any and all backflow preventers on their premises in compliance with Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811 and COMM 82. The property owner shall have corrected any malfunction, revealed by periodic testing, of any backflow preventer on their premises. The property owner shall inform the utility of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections that are not protected by an approved backflow prevention device. The property owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the by-pass. Property owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the backflow prevention device must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. In the event the property owner installs plumbing upstream of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own approved backflow preventer. The property owner is required to follow the protection practices described in the American Water Works Association publication AWWA M14 titled "Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control", unless the utility requires or authorizes other means of protecting the public water system. These requirements or authorizations will be at the discretion of the utility. 
(10)  Additional protection. In the case of premises having (a) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or (b) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a manner that, in the opinion of the utility, could create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow preventer. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, hospitals, mortuaries, plating plants, and car wash establishments. In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the utility, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of toxic substances, the utility may require an approved air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the utility. 
(11)  Wisconsin Administrative Code. Wisconsin Administrative COMM 82 is hereby adopted, except any penalty provisions therein. Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811 is hereby adopted. 
(12)  Plumbing code. This section does not supersede the State of Wisconsin Plumbing Code, COMM 81-87, but is supplementary to them. 
(13)  Penalties. 
(a)  Any property owner violating any provision of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished by forfeiture of not less than $1.00 and not more than $200.00 and shall also pay the costs of prosecution. Each day of violation is a separate offense. If any person fails to comply with this section for more than ten days after receiving written notice of the violation, the utilities may impose a penalty and cause the abandonment of the cross-connection to be performed and the expense to be assessed by placement on the tax roll for the property. 
(b)  The utilities may discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section exists, if the utilities reasonably believe that a cross-connection may contaminate the municipal water system. The utilities may also take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., except as provided in subsection (c) below. Water service shall not be restored until the matters in violation of this section have been eliminated and the plumbing brought into compliance with the provisions of this section or adequate assurance is given the utilities in its discretion that this section will be complied with in a timely manner. 
(c)  If it is determined by the utilities that a failure of compliance with this section endangers the public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate action and a written finding to that effect is filed with the city clerk and delivered to the customer's premises, service may be immediately discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., within ten days of such emergency discontinuance.

(3)  Control of industrial wastes directed to public sewers. 
(a)  Submission of basic data. 
1.  Report required. Within three months after passage of this section, each person who discharges industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include pertinent data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the wastes discharged to the sewage disposal works as required by the approving authority. 
2.  New connection report required. Similarly, each person desiring to make a new connection to a public sewer to discharge industrial wastes shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the waste to be discharged. 
3.  Report of changed conditions. Each person shall give notice to the approving authority 90 days prior to facility expansion, production increase, or process modification which is likely to result in any new or substantially increased discharge or a change in the nature of the discharge. 
4.  Report of accidental or slug discharges. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Sturgeon Bay Sewer Utility plant or the Sturgeon Bay Police Department, if unattended, of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
Within five days following such discharge, the person shall, unless waived by the approving authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW or natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
5.  Accidental discharge and slug control plans. 
a.  At the discretion of the approving authority an industrial user may be required to develop, submit for approval and implement an accidental discharge control plan. An accidental discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
Description of stored chemicals; 
Procedures for immediately notifying the wastewater treatment plant or police department of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section 13.04(3)(a)(4); and 
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutant, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
b.  Each industrial user shall provide, where reasonably necessary, adequate protection against accidental discharge or discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter. 
c.  Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense. The approving authority, at its sole discretion, when it determines such to be necessary, may mandate the construction and maintenance of such facilities and operating procedures by a discharger when it neglects or refuses to do so. Detailed plans and specifications showing the facilities and operating procedure proposed to provide needed protection, together with a proposed compliance schedule, shall be submitted to the approving authority for its review, and shall be approved by the approving authority before construction of the facility may begin. A discharger shall complete its plan and compliance schedule and submit them to the approving authority within 90 days of written notification of need from the city. The approving authority shall have 60 days from receipt of same to review and comment on the plan and the compliance schedule and to mandate any changes in either. Provided the discharger faithfully observes the foregoing provision, including the compliance schedule as approved by the approving authority, it may at all times continue its discharge to the sewer system, subject to this section. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the approving authority and construction of such facilities by the discharger shall not relieve it of the responsibility to further modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of these rules and regulations. 
(b)  Extension of time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule imposed by section 13.04(3)(a), a request for extension of time may be presented for consideration of the approving authority. 
(c)  Industrial discharges. If any waters or wastes are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which contain substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in section 13.04(2) and which (in the judgment of the approving authority) may have deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or health or constitute a public nuisance, the approving authority may institute one or more of the following: 
1.  Reject the wastes; 
2.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
3.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
4.  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating of the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of section 13.04. 
(d)  Control manholes. Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his/her wastes, including domestic sewage. 
Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in a manner acceptable to the approving authority. If measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a type acceptable to the approving authority. 
Control manholes, access facilities and related equipment shall be installed by the person discharging the waste, at his/her expense, and shall be maintained by him/her in safe condition, accessible and in proper operating condition at all times. Plans for installation of the control manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved by the approving authority prior to the beginning of construction. 
(e)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste collection and treatment charges shall be the metered potable water consumption of the person as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the Sturgeon Bay Sewer Utility. 
(f)  Metering of waste. Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the approving authority if this volume cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records.

(1)  The definitions of "mooring," "mooring anchor" and "mooring buoy" as stated in § 30.01, Wis. Stats., are adopted and incorporated by reference into this section as if fully set out. 
(2)  The federally designated special anchorage areas created in 33 CFR 110.78 may be divided into public mooring, commercial mooring, transient anchorage and buoyed channel spaces. The harbor commission is authorized and directed to prepare a map of the federally designated anchorage areas that may provide for the above described features and it is also authorized and directed to prepare administrative rules and regulations for the administration of this section, which shall include a plan for prioritizing applications in the event that there are more applications than available mooring spaces. The rules and regulations must be approved by the city council before they are effective and enforceable. Persons with existing moorings shall be given the first priority to maintain their moorings as much as possible. The legal description of the special anchorage areas is recited as follows: 
(a)  Area 1. Beginning at a point bearing 126°, 3,000 feet from the fixed green Sturgeon Bay Canal Leading Light mounted on the highway bridge; thence 120°, 1,200 feet, this line being parallel to and 150 feet from the channel edge; thence 222°, 500 feet; thence 300°, 1,200 feet; thence 042°, 500 feet to the point of beginning. 
(b)  Area 2. Beginning at a point 160 feet from the shoreline and on the east line of 15th Ave. extended; thence south 530 feet to a point 100 feet from the northern edge of the channel; thence southeasterly 2,350 feet along a line parallel to the northern edge of the channel to a point on the east line of 18th Ave. extended, using that portion of 18th Ave. that runs in a true north-south direction perpendicular to Utah St.; thence north 530 feet along this line of 18th Ave. extended to a point approximately 400 feet from the shoreline; thence northwesterly 2,350 feet along a line parallel to the northern edge of the channel to the point of beginning. 
(3)  No person shall place or cause to be placed a boat mooring within the above described federally designated special anchorage areas in the Bay of Sturgeon Bay without a permit issued by the city harbor master. 
(4)  Boat moorings by permit are restricted according to the following specifications: 
(a)  The permit application shall provide the following information: names of applicants; addresses; home, business and emergency telephone numbers; vessel name, if applicable; an indication of sail or power propulsion; manufacturer's name; model designation; hull identification number; registration or documentation number; home port or state or registration; length overall; beam; draft; color for topsides, deck and waterline stripe; and a description of the anchor intended to be used. The permit fee shall be in such an amount as the city council may from time to time determine. The harbor commission may establish rules and regulations in the event of reregistration or change of registration on any mooring. Any fees in regard thereto shall be in such an amount as the city council may from time to time establish. 
(b)  A person may procure a mooring permit for a mooring and not register a boat to that mooring if the owner does not intend to moor a boat at the mooring site. The permit shall be prepared on a form to be provided by the harbor master and shall not be effective until approved by the harbor master. At such time as the permit holder intends to moor a boat at the mooring site, the harbor master must be provided with the information about the boat as required above. 
(c)  The placement of boat moorings must be approved by the harbor master, who will consider the size of boat, depth of water, length of chain, proximity to other moorings and such other factors as the harbor master may consider relevant. The harbor master may modify the mooring conditions of the proposed mooring application. The harbor master's decisions may be reviewed by the harbor commission upon application of the applicant, the harbor master or any other interested party affected by the harbor master's decisions. 
(d)  Only one boat, which may include one service tender, may be attached to any single boat mooring. 
(e)  The minimum length of mooring chain between the anchor and the mooring buoy shall be at least twice the water depth at the placement of the mooring anchor. 
(f)  The mooring buoy shall be of a design and material approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(5)  Any boat mooring shall be considered abandoned if a properly completed application is not on file with the harbor master by May 1 of each year. A properly completed application consists of a completed and signed application form provided by the harbor master, a signed hold harmless and indemnification agreement included with the application form and payment in full of the permit fee required by this section. If there are no changes in the information provided on the previous application form and hold harmless and indemnification agreement on file with the harbor master, payment of the annual permit fee will constitute a properly completed application for that year. If there are changes in the information provided on the previous application form and hold harmless and indemnification agreement on file with the harbor master, a new application form and hold harmless and indemnification agreement shall be provided by May 1 of that year with the permit fee. In the event of abandonment as provided for herein, any person may apply for the mooring at the location of the abandoned mooring, which may then be issued in accordance with rules and regulations established by the harbor commission. 
(6)  The harbor commission is authorized to approve mooring permits not in conformance with the requirements of this section upon a showing of conditions that justify a deviation.

(2)  Permit required. 
(a)  No riparian shall construct any pier in the city without first having secured a permit therefor from the city. A permit is valid for the life of the pier, whether a permanent or portable pier, as long as its location and construction remain substantially unchanged and the pier and its use comply with the provisions of this section. 
(b)  Any required U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or Department of Natural Resources permit required for the proposed pier shall be obtained prior to issuance of a pier permit from the City of Sturgeon Bay.

(e)  A preexisting pier which fails to conform with the requirements of this section is permissible as a nonconforming structure. Owners of nonconforming structures may perform repairs and maintenance upon the nonconforming structure without expanding the structure. A permit shall be required for any repair or modification of a preexisting pier exceeding $250.00 in value. 
(3)  Application for permit. All applications for a permit shall be in writing on forms provided by the harbor master.

(4)  [Consulting fees and expenses.] The harbor master may, in his/her sole judgment determine that the opinion of a consultant is necessary to determine whether the pier proposed by the applicant meets the standards of this section. In such event the applicant shall be required to reimburse the city for all consulting fees and expenses incurred in such review. 
(5)  Standards for pier construction and use. 
(a)  No pier or vessel attached to it may extend beyond the pierhead line of the City of Sturgeon Bay.

(j)  No pier shall be constructed or maintained with a screen or in any other manner which would trap or accumulate aquatic plants. 
(k)  Unless they are preexisting, the total number of piers shall not exceed one for riparian zones abutting parcels with single-family dwellings and shall not exceed two for riparian zones abutting parcels with two-family dwellings. The total number of piers for riparian zones abutting multiple-family residential developments, or common areas for condominiums or residential subdivisions, shall be determined by the harbor commission, but shall not exceed the total number of dwelling units. 
(6)  Removal of unlawful construction and use. Any pier that is not in compliance with the requirements of this section shall constitute an unlawful obstruction to navigable waters, and the procedures for removal of such unlawful structures shall be as provided in § 30.13, Wis. Stats. Any pier and/or its use that is not in compliance with the provisions of this section shall constitute a public nuisance and may be subject to abatement procedures as provided by law. 
(7)  Enforcement; forfeiture. Any person or entity in violation of this section may be subject to a forfeiture of up to $100.00, plus costs, for each violation, with each day that the unlawful structure remains in place constituting a separate offense.

In considering the request for variance the harbor commission shall consider the factors set forth in subsection 14.09(8)(a) hereof, as well as other relevant information. 
(d)  Whenever a request for variance is to be presented to the harbor commission of the City of Sturgeon Bay the applicant shall give notice, by registered mail sent at least 14 days prior to the scheduled meeting, of the proposed variance to adjoining riparian property owners on both sides of the property subject to the variance request. 
(9)  Appeals. 
(a)  The applicant or any party aggrieved by a decision of the harbor master upon a pier permit application may appeal such decision by filing a written request for appeal within 30 days after the determination to issue or deny the application to the harbor commission of the City of Sturgeon Bay, with the appeal request to be filed with the city clerk.

(See section 19.08 of this chapter for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter. 
(2)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when § 30.12(4)(a), Wis. Stats., applies.

(1)  The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the city which are five acres or more and are shown on the final wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this chapter and which are: 
(a)  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high watermark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the city shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. 
(b)  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high watermark of navigable rivers or streams or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in section 19.04(2) shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
(2)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high watermark location shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high watermark. 
(3)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district.

The regulations contained in this section are established to encourage imaginative design of coordinated land uses and to provide for greater flexibility and design freedom than permitted under the basic district regulations, if such development is found to be in accordance with the purpose, spirit and intent of this ordinance, and is found not to be harmful or otherwise adverse to the environment, the character of the neighborhood, or the health, safety and welfare of the community. They are also intended to permit and encourage diversification and variation and in the relationship of uses, structures, and open spaces for those developments that are conceived and implemented as comprehensive unified projects. They are further intended to encourage more efficient use of public services and improvements, and to encourage and facilitate preservation of open space and other natural features such as woodlands, floodplains and wetlands. Finally, they are intended to ensure a high level of detail and scrutiny for certain large or intensive developments which potentially exert a high level of influence on the character of the neighborhood or community.

Further, no final plat of subdivision or certified survey map for a parcel designated PUD shall occur until a final planned development plan has been approved by the city council of the City of Sturgeon Bay. However, the city shall continue to treat the subdivided parts as a single PUD and require the individual parcel owners to conform with the previously approved final planned development. 
(h)  Required sewer and water. All habitable buildings within a PUD shall be served by a sanitary sewage system and a public water supply system owned and operated by the City of Sturgeon Bay.

All structures located on the perimeter of a PUD shall be set back from the property line or street right-of-way a distance equal to or greater than the required setback in the adjacent zone. Interior yards and setbacks shall be in conformity with good site planning practice. Any variations must be identified. 
(k)  Bonding required. A bond or letter of credit to cover the cost of required public improvements submitted prior to issuance of any permits for the PUD. 
(l)  Stormwater management. Surface drainage and storm water detention facilities shall be designed so that the runoff from the developed site shall not exceed the runoff from the site in its natural state during a storm of two year frequency. Elements of the design regarding method of drainage computation, allowance for off-site runoff, maximum ponding depths, and other considerations shall meet the approval of the city engineer. 
(4)  Review criteria. In reviewing proposed planned unit developments, the plan commission and common council shall consider whether the proposed development is consistent with the spirit and intent of this ordinance, has been prepared with competent professional advice and guidance, and produces benefits to the city compared to conventional development.

(h)  Is economically practical. 
(i)  By virtue of its benefits to the city and overall conformance to the purpose and intent of the zoning code, justifies the intended variations from the strict interpretation of the zoning code, and justifies specific special uses requested. 
(5)  Procedures. 
(a)  Preapplication meeting. Developers shall meet with city staff and discuss the proposed PUD prior to formal application. The purpose of the developer meeting with the staff is to exchange information. Staff shall explain their current jurisdictional regulations and policies to the developer, as well as comprehensive plan recommendations pertaining to the subject property. The developer shall be prepared to discuss the general concept of the PUD, including property boundaries, proposed land uses, densities, and conceptual layout. 
(b)  Conceptual planned unit development review. 
1.  Following the preapplication meeting, the developer shall appear before the plan commission to informally discuss the initial concept for the proposal. The purpose of the conceptual PUD review is for the plan commission to provide feedback to the developer regarding the concept of the proposed development and zoning changes. The commission members may comment on the general acceptability of the concept and on specific aspects of the development that should be included, excluded, altered, or otherwise addressed as the project moves through the review process. However, the plan commission shall not be required to provide a formal position statement on the proposal. The developer shall not be required to comply with any comments which are offered by the plan commission during the conceptual PUD Review, but shall take any comments under advisement in producing the preliminary PUD. 
2.  Applications. Applications for the conceptual planned unit development review shall be submitted on forms provided by the city at least two weeks prior to the scheduled plan commission meeting. Applications shall contain a full legal description and map of the subject property and 20 copies of the general concept plan showing (as applicable) all existing and proposed streets, existing and proposed land uses, residential densities, total site area, access and parking areas, approximate building sites, important physical features (both natural and manmade), and other information desirable for promoting meaningful review of the proposed project. After review for completeness by staff, the application shall be placed on the appropriate city plan commission agenda for review. 
(c)  Preliminary planned unit development review. Following the preapplication meeting and the conceptual PUD review, a preliminary planned unit development shall be reviewed. 
1.  Review procedure. Preliminary PUDs shall be reviewed by the plan commission, and by the city council consecutively. 
a.  Public hearing. All preliminary planned unit development applications shall require a public hearing before the plan commission. The public hearing shall be noticed by the city as a class 2 notice as required by Wisconsin Statutes, and the city shall give notice, by regular mail, of the proposed changes to all property owners whose property lies within 300 feet measured in a straight line, from the exterior boundary of the property subject to the proposed PUD. Said notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing, however failure of a neighboring property owner to receive such mailed notice shall not invalidate a public hearing. In addition, applicant shall post signage visible to every facing street at least ten days prior to the hearing. The signage shall identify the property as being the subject of a public hearing and identify the appropriate city office that may be contacted for information. 
b.  Plan commission recommendation. The plan commission shall make a recommendation at a subsequent meeting after the public hearing. However, the plan commission can modify this requirement by an unanimous vote of the members present after conducting the public hearing and make a recommendation at the same meeting as the public hearing. The plan commission shall make a recommendation within 90 days of the submittal of the preliminary PUD, unless such time period is extended by mutual agreement with the applicant. If action on the planned unit development application is delayed more than 120 days from the date of the public hearing, a new public hearing shall take place. The plan commission may grant up to a 60-day extension if warranted by extenuating circumstances. 
c.  Common council. After the recommendations of the plan commission (or if the plan commission fails to make a recommendation within the required time period), the preliminary PUD proposal shall be reviewed by the common council. The council shall approve, conditionally approve, or reject the preliminary PUD within 45 days after the recommendation (or failure to make a recommendation) of the plan commission, unless such time period is extended by mutual agreement with the applicant. Any approval may include conditions and restrictions to protect the public interest and adjacent areas, improve the development and assure compliance with the provisions and intent of this section. Any preliminary PUD which has not been approved by the common council within the such time frame (or mutual extension thereof) shall be deemed denied. 
2.  Preliminary PUD application. Applications for preliminary PUD review on forms furnished by the city must be submitted to the city a minimum of 30 days prior to the hearing date. The city may require an earlier submittal date if the proposed PUD is expected to require additional staff review time. The hearing date shall not be established until all required materials are received by the city. The submittal for a preliminary PUD shall contain all information required in the application form and shall also include the following (as applicable): 
a.  Twenty folded copies of a site plan indicating: 
1)  Project title.

c.  Details of all variations from the underlying zoning district requested in the PUD. If no variations are requested, so state none are being requested. 
d.  Traffic impact analysis indicating (may be waived by the city engineer if the project size is not expected to have substantial impact upon the existing road system): 
1)  Traffic generation of proposal. 
2)  Impact on existing traffic. 
3)  Improvements needed to minimize negative impact of site generated traffic on street network. 
e.  Proof of ownership. If ownership is in a trust, corporation, LLC, LLP, partnership, or other type of entity, the ownership of the entity, trustees, shareholders, beneficial owners, etc. shall be disclosed.

h.  Conceptual utilities plan. 
(d)  Final planned unit development review. Following approval of the preliminary PUD by the city council, a final PUD shall be reviewed. 
1.  Partial final PUD. Final PUD approval may be sought for the entire PUD or segments thereof. However, if final PUD approval is sought for a portion of the PUD, the segment must conform to the previously approved preliminary PUD. Improvements on or off site necessary to support the PUD, or segment thereof, shall be required. 
2.  Conformance with approved preliminary PUD. The final PUD must be in general conformance with the previously approved preliminary PUD plans. If the final PUD plans are substantially different than the preliminary PUD, then the development must be reviewed as a new preliminary PUD proposal. 
3.  Review procedure. Final PUDs are reviewed by the plan commission and the city council consecutively. 
a.  Plan commission recommendation. The plan commission shall review the final PUD on the basis of criteria set forth herein and forward its recommendations to the city council within 45 days after a completed submittal has been received from the petitioner, unless such time period is extended by mutual agreement with the applicant. 
b.  Common council. The city council shall take under advisement the recommendations of the plan commission when considering the final PUD. The city council shall approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the final PUD within 60 days of the plan commission recommendation unless an extension is established through mutual agreement with the petitioner. Failure to approve the final PUD within 60 days of the plan commission recommendation, and without an extension through mutual agreement with the petitioner, shall be deemed a disapproval of the PUD application. Should the final PUD be disapproved by the city council, the petitioner may resubmit revised plans to the city council for reconsideration, if permission to submit is requested and granted by the council. 
c.  Zoning map amendment. Upon approval of the final PUD plan, the city council shall authorize the planned development in accordance with the approved development plan and such modifications the board may make to said plans through the adoption of an ordinance for the PUD zoning amendment. Upon final approval of the ordinance, the designated PUD shall be recorded on the city zoning map. 
4.  Final PUD application. An application and materials required for final PUD review must be submitted to the city a minimum of two weeks prior to the meeting date for consideration by the plan commission. The city may require an earlier submittal date if the proposed PUD is expected to require additional review time. Meeting dates shall not be established until all required submittals are received by the city. The materials required to be submitted to the city to initiate a review of a final PUD include the following (as applicable): 
a.  Twenty folded copies, and two copies no larger than 11 inches by 17 inches or other recordable format approved by the register of deeds of a site plan indicating:

(7)  Formal subdivision of parcels in a planned unit development. 
(a)  Any land division of any parcel designated PUD shall conform to the approved PUD and shall require the city approval of a plat or certified survey map, as applicable. For purposes of dividing land, the final PUD may be considered a preliminary plat of subdivision. 
(b)  If approval of final PUD plans are sought for a segment of a planned development for which preliminary PUD plans have been approved, a final plat of subdivision for the segment must be approved by the city council before permits will be approved. 
(8)  Combined preliminary and final PUD review. The proposed developer of a PUD may request a combined preliminary and final planned unit development review. Said combined review will only be permitted with plan commission approval, and must be requested at the time of the plan commission conceptual PUD Review. Scheduling of hearings and meetings shall adhere to the time frames established for preliminary PUD review. An official submittal for combined preliminary and final PUD review must contain all required submittal items specified in subsection (5)(c)3. and subsection (5)(d)3. 
(9)  Failure to begin planned unit development. Unless the petitioner or a successor to the petitioner has substantially completed construction of the public improvements and has commenced construction of the uses approved in the PUD, the PUD shall automatically lapse two years after the date of approval by the city council. The city council upon a written petition from the holder of the PUD, may for good cause extend for a period of up to one additional year the period for beginning the PUD. The city council shall be entitled to grant no more than three such extensions beyond the original expiration date for the PUD. If the PUD lapses under the provisions of this section, the city shall remove the PUD from the zoning map and the basic underlying zoning classification approved at the time of approval of the PUD, shall continue in effect.

20.25 - Conditional uses. 
(1)  The city plan commission may, after a review and public hearing, authorize the issuance of a conditional use permit for conditional uses specified for each district, provided such uses are in accordance with the purpose and intent of this chapter. Whenever a conditional use permit is requested and the required public hearing is scheduled and noticed by city as a class 2 notice, the city shall give notice, by regular mail, of the proposed conditional use to all property owners whose property lies within 300 feet measured in a straight line from the exterior boundary of the property subject to the proposed conditional use permit. Said notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing; however failure of a neighboring property owner to receive such mailed notice shall not invalidate a public hearing. If action is delayed more than 120 days from the date of public hearing, a new public hearing shall take place. The plan commission may grant up to a 60-day extension if warranted by extenuating circumstances. In addition to the notification requirements listed above, applicant shall post signage visible to every facing street at least ten days prior to the hearing. The signage shall identify the property as being the subject of a public hearing and identify the appropriate city office that may be contacted for information. 
(2)  Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted to the community development department on a form provided by the zoning administrator and reviewed by staff. Applications shall contain: 
(a)  A full legal description and property map. 
(b)  A plan showing the location, size and shape of the lot(s) involved and of any proposed structures, and the existing and proposed use of each structure and lot. 
(c)  A written description of the proposed conditional use describing the type of activities, buildings, and structures involved in the use. 
(d)  Written statements showing how the proposed conditional use meets the general standards for conditional uses (sub. 4) and any specific requirements for a particular use. 
    After review by staff, an application deemed complete shall be placed on the appropriate city plan commission agenda for review. 
(3)  The city plan commission shall review, as appropriate, the proposed site and operation, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and water systems and whether the proposed project will adversely affect property values in the neighboring area. 
(4)  A conditional use permit may only be issued by the plan commission upon making a finding that: 
(a)  The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare. 
(b)  The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the surrounding area. 
(c)  The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
(d)  Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other necessary facilities exist or will be provided to serve the conditional use. 
(e)  Adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion on the public streets. 
(f)  The conditional use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(5)  Conditions related to landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, permit duration, sureties, lighting, fencing, operational control, hours of operation, traffic circulation, deed restrictions, access restrictions, increased yards, and parking requirements may be required by the city plan commission upon its finding that such conditions are necessary to fulfill the purposes and intent of this chapter. Any conditions imposed must be reasonable, and the extent practicable, measurable. Such conditions shall be based on substantial evidence. 
(6)  Conditional uses shall comply with all other provisions of this chapter such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking and loading. 
(7)  Any conditional use granted by the city plan commission shall terminate unless initiated within 365 days of date of decision by the city plan commission. A conditional use shall be operational within 730 days of its approval by the plan commission. Failure to initiate the development within 365 days and/or begin operations within 730 days shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. An applicant may request that the plan commission approve an extension for justifiable reasons. 
(8)  Once granted, a conditional use permit shall remain in effect as long as the conditions upon which the permit was issued and the requirements of this ordinance are followed. Unless a specific duration is included in a conditional use permit, a conditional use permit shall automatically expire if the conditional use changes to a permitted use not requiring a conditional use permit or if the conditional use is discontinued or ceases to exist for a continuous period of at least 365 days for any reason. 
(9)  If an application for a conditional use permit is denied, a new application for the same conditional use will not be considered by the plan commission for a period of 12 months from the date of denial, except on grounds of new evidence as determined by the zoning administrator.

Said analysis shall aid in determining a saturation/capture report. An application for a large retail development will not be received by the city unless it is accompanied by the fiscal and economic impact analysis. Any entity intending on making application shall contact the community development director and provide the funds for the city, who will commission a third party to perform the analysis. The city will provide the completed analysis to the applicant governed by section 20.41 which shall be incorporated into the submitted plan by the applicant. The city in its sole discretion shall determine the scope and matter of the fiscal and economic analysis. In determining the parameters of the analysis, the city staff shall consider and make a recommendation to the common council on any other recent impact analysis for a similar project and, as applicable, may incorporate pertinent data from such analysis into the parameters of the required fiscal and economic impact analysis. The analysis shall be based upon criteria established by the city and shall include but not be limited to: 
(a)  Projected costs to the city arising from required infrastructure improvements, including operating and maintenance of necessary infrastructure. 
(b)  Projected costs to the city arising from increased demand for city services (emergency services, stormwater management, snow removal, etc.). 
(c)  Projected tax revenue to the city generated by the large retail development. 
(d)  Projected impact on land values of commercial and residential properties affected by the large retail development, including the value of any building to be vacated by a replacement site.

The environmental analysis form shall be obtained from the community development department (based on [the] Environmental Analysis Questionnaire used by Wisconsin DNR under WEPA). The analysis form shall be completed by a qualified engineer and shall be used to assess the potential environmental impact of the proposed large retail establishment. 
(b)  Review and comment period. After the submitted environmental analysis form has been deemed complete by the community development director, a notice of request for comments on the environmental analysis form shall be published as a Class I notice. The notice shall state the availability of the environmental analysis form for review by interested parties and provide a 30-day period from the date of publishing for comments to be submitted. The notice shall also be sent to any parties who have requested notification and may be sent to any local, state or federal agencies with jurisdiction in the subject matter. 
(c)  [Consideration by plan commission.] The environmental analysis form and any submitted comments shall be considered by the plan commission during its review of an application for a large retail establishment. If the plan commission finds that the proposed project will result in significant undesirable environmental impact, it may deny the application or may require measures to mitigate such impact.

(a)  Application procedure. After the preliminary meeting, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat and supplementary material and shall file with the clerk-treasurer a written application on forms furnished by the city for approval of such plat, accompanied by 17 clearly legible copies thereof at least ten days prior to the meeting of the plan commission at which action is desired. The clerk-treasurer shall, within two days of filing, forward copies of the preliminary plat as per the following schedule: 
1.  Two copies for each of the state agencies required to review the plat to the department which shall examine the plat for compliance with §§ 236.15, 236.16, 236.20 and 236.21(1) and (2), Wis. Stats. If the subdivision abuts or adjoins a state trunk highway or connecting highway, the department shall transmit two copies to the department of transportation so that agency may determine whether it has any objection to the plat on the basis of its rules as provided in § 236.13, Wis. Stats. If the subdivision is not served by a public sewer and provision for such service has not been made, the department shall transmit two copies to the department of industry, labor and human relations so that agency may determine whether it has any objection to the plat on the basis of its rules as provided in § 236.13, Wis. Stats. In lieu of this procedure the agencies may designate local officials to act as their agents in examining the plats for compliance with the Wisconsin Statutes or their rules by filing a written delegation of authority with the approving body. 
2.  Four copies to the county planning agency, if the agency employs on a full-time basis a professional engineer, a planner, or other person charged with the duty of administering planning legislation and adopts a policy requiring submission so that body may determine if it has any objection to the plat on the basis of conflict with parks, parkways, expressways, major highways, airports, drainage channels, schools, or other planned public developments. If no county planning agency exists, then two copies shall be transmitted to the county park commission, except that in a county with a county executive or county administrator two copies shall be submitted to the county park manager, if the subdivision abuts a county park or parkway so that body may determine if it has any objection to the plat on the basis of conflict with the park or parkway development. 
(b)  Staff review.

Their recommendations in respect thereto shall be transmitted to the plan commission. 
(d)  State review. Within 20 days of receipt of a subdivision [plat], the state agencies shall inform the subdivider and the local authorities of any objections to the final plat. If the state agencies have no objections, they shall so certify on the face of a copy of the final plat and shall return that copy to the clerk-treasurer. If an objecting state agency fails to act within 20 days of the date of receipt of the final plat, it shall be deemed to have no objections to the plat. 
(e)  Plan commission review. The plan commission shall examine the final plat as to its conformance with the preliminary plat, the requirements set forth in this chapter, and with any other ordinances, administrative rules and regulations and plans which may affect it; and shall recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the plat. The plan commission shall transmit the plat, together with the recommendations of the commission, to the mayor and city council within 30 days of its submission to the city clerk, for necessary action. 
(f)  Council action. The council shall approve or reject the final plat within 60 days of its submission, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. When the approving authority is a municipality and determines to approve the plat, it shall give at least ten days' prior written notice of its intention to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of such proposed plat, but failure to give such notice shall not invalidate any such plat. If a plat is rejected, the reasons therefor shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting and a copy thereof or a written statement of the reasons supplied to the subdivider. If the approving authority fails to act within 60 days and the time has not been extended by agreement and if no unsatisfied objections have been filed within that period, the plat shall be deemed approved, and, upon demand, a certificate to that effect shall be made on the face of the plat by the clerk of the authority which has failed to act. 
(g)  Clerk's signature. The subdivider shall obtain any necessary approvals required by state law. After the council has approved the final plat and the subdivider has obtained the required signatures to all the required certificates and after the subdivider has filed the necessary petitions, contracts and bonds ensuring the installation of the required improvements, the clerk-treasurer shall affix his/her signature to the final plat. 
(h)  Recording. The subdivider shall present the final plat in the office of the Door County Register of Deeds for recording within 30 days of the date of the last approval of the plat and within six months of the first approval.

(e)  All lots shall have sufficient frontage on a public street to allow vehicular access. 
(f)  Every lot in a subdivision shall abut on a public street unless the street is designated as a private street on the plat or certified survey map and the following note is placed on the plat or map: "The City is not responsible for the maintenance of private streets." 
(3)  Block design. 
(a)  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be appropriate for the topography and the type of development contemplated. 
(b)  To provide adequate access and circulation to community facilities, the plan commission may require sidewalks, either along streets or through the center of blocks. Center crosswalks shall not be less than ten feet wide. 
(c)  Subdivision lots shall be in conformance with the area and width requirements of the zoning code, chapter 20 of this Municipal Code. Area and width requirements of subdivision lots in the extraterritorial planning area shall conform to city zoning ordinances and ch. ILHR 85, Wis. Adm. Code. 
(4)  Lot drainage. 
(a)  An application for final plat approval shall include a drainage plan for the subdivision. The plan commission shall approve the drainage plan before they recommend approval of the final plat. The plan shall include proposed contours at vertical intervals of not more than two feet and the final grade elevations to be maintained along all lot lines. To insure compliance with the approved drainage plan, a covenant shall be included on the face of the final plat requiring compliance therewith by the developer. 
(b)  Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots. Any storm water drainage system will be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where necessary, shall be designed in accordance with all government regulations and a copy of design computations for engineering capacities shall accompany plans submitted by the planning engineer or surveyor for the final plat. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. 
(c)  Should the approved drainage plan require any grading or the installation of storm sewer or other storm water drainage facilities, the subdivider shall cause such grading or improvements to be installed at his/her expense at the same time the subdivision roads are being graded. 
(5)  Foundation design. When the results of tests conducted pursuant to section 21.04(2)(h)3 indicate that the groundwater table is equal to or less than nine feet from the proposed street centerline elevation, the plan commission shall direct the subdivider to:

(b)  In lieu of constructing improvements as required in subsection (a), the subdivider shall state in writing that the construction of all improvements required shall be completed within two years from the date of approval of the final plat by the council unless good cause can be shown for the granting of an extension of time by authority of the council. If no extension is granted, the city at its option may cause uncompleted required work to be constructed, and the costs of such improvements to be assessed to benefitting property owners. 
(c)  The approval of the final plat by the council shall constitute acceptance of the dedication of any public street, road or highway dedicated in the plat. 
(d)  Where unusual or exceptional factors or conditions exist, the council may modify the provisions of this chapter. A written statement of reasons for modification shall be attached to all copies of the construction plans. 
(2)  Improvements at subdividers's expense. The subdivider shall pay for the following improvements: 
(a)  Streets rough graded from property line to property line and terraces topsoiled to conform to specifications established by the city council and on file in the city clerk's office. "Rough grade" means 15 inches below finished grade. 
(b)  A public sanitary sewer system adequate to provide the subdivision with a complete sanitary sewer system, including a lateral connection for each lot and a satisfactory connection to the city sewer system. The entire system shall be designed to meet the approval of the council, the city engineer and the utilities general manager. 
(c)  A complete water distribution system adequate to serve the area platted, including connections for each lot. The entire system shall be designed to meet the approval of the council, the city engineer and the utilities general manager. The city shall pay for and install all necessary fire hydrants, provided the developer appropriately advises the city from time to time when the system is ready for the installation. 
(d)  A storm water sewer or drainage system adequate to serve the area being platted and otherwise meeting the approval of the council and the city engineer. 
(e)  If a pumping station is required to pump either sanitary waste or storm water into the existing public sewer mains, the subdivider shall install at his/her expense a pumping station and force main approved by the city engineer, adequate to service a subdivision, and shall deed the pumping station, force main, equipment and site to the city prior to acceptance of the final plat. 
(f)  All bridges and culverts. 
(g)  Concrete sidewalks to conform to specifications established by the city along all streets within the area being platted, unless the common council determines a street (or portion thereof) is exempted due to factors including but not limited to right-of-way width, topography, and density of development. 
(3)  Improvements that may be at subdivider's expense. The subdivider may have to pay for the following improvements: 
(a)  Concrete curb and gutter constructed to conform with specifications established by the council. 
(4)  Construction plans and inspection required. 
(a)  Whenever the city requires any improvements, construction plans for improvements to be installed shall be furnished in accordance with the specifications and approval of the officials having jurisdiction before improvements are installed. The following plans may be required: 
1.  The profile of each proposed street with tentative grades indicated. 
2.  The cross section of each proposed street showing width of pavement, curb and gutter; the location and width of sidewalks and terraces; and the location and size of the utility mains.

(c)  The subdivider shall engage his/her own contractors on his/her own responsibility for all required work. He/she may contract with the city to do part or all of the work for him/her at his/her expense. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the city to perform such work unless in contracts with the subdivider to perform the work. 
(5)  Stage development. Where the council determines that the whole of the plat and its subdivision cannot immediately be fully improved with respect to the installation of all storm and sanitary sewers and related facilities, water mains and related facilities and street improvements due to unavoidable delay in the acquisition of land necessary for improvements or due to unavoidable delay in obtaining necessary engineering data and information or for any other good reason or cause, the council may authorize the subdivider to proceed with the installation of improvements required under this chapter on a portion of the subdivision. In this event the requirements of this chapter shall apply to that portion authorized for immediate improvement. 
(Code 1992, § 21.07; Ord. No. 1185-1112, §§ 1, 2, 11-20-12) 
21.08 - Easements. 
(1)  The plan commission may require easements for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and head mains or other utility lines. Easements shall be at least ten feet wide and may run across lots or along rear lot lines. These easements should preferably be located along rear lot lines. 
(2)  The plan commission may require easements or drainage ways where a subdivision includes a segment of water courses, drainage ways, channels or streams. 
(Code 1992, § 21.08) 
21.09 - Public sites and open spaces. 
    The following provisions are established to set aside adequate land and preserve it for development of public parks, recreation and open space, to provide for proper location of sites as the city develops and to provide public park, recreation and open space sites necessary to serve the additional persons brought into the city by construction of new dwelling units and that costs may be most equitably apportioned on the basis of additional need created by the addition of these units. 
(1)  Reservation of sites. 
(a)  Where the area proposed to be subdivided contains a park, playground or other public area which is shown upon the city master plan, the area shall be dedicated to the proper public agency or be reserved for acquisition within a three-year period. If the land is not acquired during this period, it shall be released to the subdivider. 
(b)  Whenever any river, stream or important surface drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an easement along each side of the river, stream or drainage course to widen, deepen, relocate, improve or protect the river, stream or drainage course. 
(c)  Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided embraces all or any part of an arterial street or other public way which has been designated in the comprehensive plan component, the public way shall be made a part of the plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on the plan or map. 
(2)  Dedication of sites. 
(a)  Where feasible and compatible with the comprehensive city plan, the subdivider shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land for park, recreation and open space needs of the subdivision within the city. The location of the land to be dedicated shall be determined by the plan commission, upon the recommendation of the parks and recreation board. 
(b)  The amount of land to be provided shall be determined by the following method: 
1.  The quantity of land to be dedicated shall be equal in value to $300.00 per residential lot created by the subdivider. Land dedicated for parks should not differ greatly from the surrounding territory and the rest of the subdivision of land. Where dedicated park land borders a street, the subdivider shall install improvements required by this chapter.

(f)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as creating for the city any liability for any injuries, loss or damage caused by a compliance or failure to comply of any subdivider or developer to maintain all improvements in a safe condition until relieved of such responsibility. 
(3)  Variances. The council and plan commission may grant variances from the provisions of this chapter after determining that:

(5)  Amendments. For the purpose of promoting the public health, safety and general welfare, the city council may from time to time amend the regulations imposed by this chapter.

At least one flush water closet, lavatory basin and bathtub or shower, properly connected to a water and sanitary sewer system approved by the plumbing inspector or chief of the inspection department and in good working condition, shall be supplied for each ten persons or fraction thereof residing within a rooming house, including members of the operator's family wherever they share the use of the said facilities, provided that, in a rooming house where rooms are let only to males, tank system urinals of the floor resting type fixtures may be substituted for not more than one-half of the required number of water closets. All such facilities shall be so located within the dwelling as to be reasonably accessible from a common hall or passageway to all persons sharing such facilities. Every lavatory basin and bathtub or shower shall be supplied with hot water at all times. No such facilities shall be located in a basement except by written approval of the health officer or chief of the inspection department. 
(6)  Changing linen and towels. The operator of every rooming house shall change supplied bed linen and towels therein at least once a week, and prior to the letting of any room to any occupant. The operator shall be responsible for the maintenance of all supplied bedding in a clean and sanitary manner. 
(7)  Sleeping room areas. Every room occupied for sleeping purposes by one person shall contain at least 80 square feet of floor space, and every room occupied for sleeping purposes by more than one person shall contain at least 40 square feet of floor space for each occupant thereof over 12 years of age and at least 30 square feet for each occupant therein under 12 years of age, as computed in accordance with section 22.07(3). 
(8)  Egress. Every rooming unit shall have safe, unobstructed means of egress leading to safe and open space at ground level, as required by the laws of this state and this city. 
(9)  Maintaining sanitary conditions. The operator of every rooming house shall be responsible for the sanitary maintenance of all walls, floors and ceilings, and for maintenance of a sanitary condition in every other part of the rooming house, and shall be further responsible for the sanitary maintenance of the entire premises where leased or occupied by the operator. 
(10)  Application to efficiency apartments. Every provision of this chapter which applies to rooming houses shall also apply to efficiency apartments, motels, cabins, hotels, and similar accommodations except to the extent that any such provisions may be found in conflict with the laws of this state or with the lawful regulations of any state board or agency. 
(11)  Suspension of occupancy standards. The health officer is empowered to suspend the operation of sections 22.07(1), 22.07(2) and/or 22.09(7) hereof by special or general order in writing when he/she shall deem an emergency exists, which in his/her discretion shall warrant such suspension; provided, however, that no such general or special order to suspend operation of sections 22.07(1) and/or 22.09(7) shall be of a duration longer than ten days. 
(Code 1992, § 22.09) 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, § 236.12, Wis. Stats. 
22.10 - Condemnation procedure. 
(1) (a) The county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer may order the owner of premises upon which is located any building or part thereof within the city, which in its judgment is so old, dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, insanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, and so that it would be unreasonable to repair the same, to raze and remove such building or part thereof and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition, or if it can be made safe by repairs to repair and make safe and sanitary or to raze, remove and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition at the owner's option; or, where there has been a cessation of normal construction of any building or structure for a period of more than two years, to raze and remove such building or part thereof and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition. The order shall specify a time in which the owner shall comply therewith and specify repairs, if any. It shall be served on the owner of record or the owner's agent where an agent is in charge of the building in the manner provided for service of a summons in the circuit court. If the owner and the owner's agent cannot be found, or if the owner is deceased and an estate has not been opened, the order may be served by posting it on the main entrance of the building and by publishing it as a class 1 notice, under ch. 985, Wis. Stats., before the time limited in the order commences to run. The time limited in the order commences to run from the date of service upon the owner or the agent in the manner of a summons or, if the owner and agent cannot be found, from the date that the order was posted on the building. The order shall also be served on the holder of any encumbrance of record by first class mail at the last-known address and by publication as a class 1 notice under ch. 985, Wis. Stats. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsection (7), if the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer determines that the cost of such repairs would exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of such building divided by the ratio of the assessed value to the recommended value as last published by the department of revenue for the city, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed for the purposes of this section that such building is a public nuisance. 
(c)  If a raze order issued under subsection (a) is recorded with the county register of deeds, the order is considered to have been served, as of the date the raze order is recorded, on any person claiming an interest in the building or the real estate as a result of a conveyance from the owner of record unless the conveyance was recorded before the recording of the raze order. 
(2) (a) If the owner fails or refuses to comply within the time prescribed, the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer may cause such building or part thereof to be razed and removed and may restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition either through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, or closed if unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use. The cost of such razing, removal and restoration of the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition or closing may be charged in full or in part against the real estate upon which such building is located, and if that cost is so charged it is a lien upon such real estate and may be assessed and collected as a special tax. Any portion of the cost charged against the real estate that is not reimbursed under § 632.103(2), Wis. Stats., from funds withheld from an insurance settlement may be assessed and collected as a special tax. When any building has been ordered razed and removed and an order has been issued to restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition, the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer under said contract or arrangement aforesaid may sell the salvage and valuable materials at the highest price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses of such razing, removal and restoration of the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition, shall be promptly remitted to the circuit court with a report of such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and the amounts deducted, for the use of the person who may be entitled thereto, subject to the order of the court. If there remains no surplus to be turned over to the court, the report shall so state. If the building or part thereof is insanitary and unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the county health officer or chief of the inspection department shall post a placard on the premises containing the following words: "This Building Cannot Be Used for Human Habitation, Occupancy or Use." It is the duty of the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer to prohibit the use of the building for human habitation, occupancy or use until the necessary repairs have been made. 
(b)  The county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer may, in his, her or its official capacity, commence and prosecute an action in circuit court for an order of the court requiring the owner to comply with an order to raze or remove any building or part thereof issued under this section if the owner fails or refuses to do so within the time prescribed in the order, or for an order of the court requiring any person occupying a building whose occupancy has been prohibited under this section to vacate the premises, or any combination of the court orders. Hearing on such actions shall be given preference. Costs shall be in the discretion of the court. 
(c)  Any person who rents, leases or occupies a building which has been condemned for human habitation, occupancy or use shall be fined not less than $5.00 and not more than $50.00 or imprisoned not more than 30 days for each week of such violation, or both. 
(3)  Anyone affected by any such order shall within the time provided by § 893.76, Wis. Stats., apply to the circuit court for an order restraining the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer from razing and removing the building or part thereof and restoring the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition or forever be barred. The hearing shall be held within 20 days and shall be given preference. The court shall determine whether the order of the county health officer or chief of the inspection department is reasonable, and if found reasonable the court shall dissolve the restraining order, and if found not reasonable the court shall continue the restraining order or modify it as the circumstances require. Costs shall be in the discretion of the court. If the court finds that the order of the county health officer or chief of the inspection department is unreasonable, the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer shall issue no other order under this section in regard to the same building or part thereof until its condition is substantially changed. The remedies provided in this subsection are exclusive remedies and anyone affected by such an order of the county health officer or chief of the inspection department shall not be entitled to recover any damages for the razing and removal of any such building and the restoration of the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition. 
(4)  "Building" as used in this section includes any building or structure. 
(5)  If any building ordered razed and removed and the site ordered restored to a dust-free and erosion-free condition or made safe and sanitary by repairs contains personal property or fixtures which will unreasonably interfere with the razing or repair of such building and restoration of such site or if the razing and removal of the building and the restoration of the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition makes necessary the removal, sale or destruction of such personal property or fixtures, the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer may order in writing the removal of such personal property or fixtures by a certain date. Such order shall be served as provided in subsection (1). If the personal property or fixtures or both are not removed by the time specified, the county health officer or chief of the inspection department may store the same, or may sell it, or if it has no appreciable value he or she may destroy the same. In case the property is stored the amount paid for storage shall be a lien against such property and against the real estate and, to the extent that the amount is not reimbursed under § 632.103(2), Wis. Stats., from funds withheld from an insurance settlement, shall be assessed and collected as a special tax against the real estate if the real estate is owned by the owner of the personal property and fixtures. If the property is stored, the owner thereof, if known, shall be notified of the place of its storage and if it be not claimed by the owner it may be sold at the expiration of six months after it has been stored. In case of sale the handling of the sale and the distribution of the net proceeds after deducting the cost of storage and any other costs shall be handled as specified in subsection (2) and a report made to the circuit court as therein specified. Anyone affected by any order made under this subsection may appeal as provided in subsection (3). 
(6) (a) In this subsection "building" means a building, dwelling or structure. 
(b)  Whenever an owner of any building permits the same, either as a result of vandalism or for any other reason, to deteriorate or become dilapidated or blighted to the extent where windows, doors or other openings or plumbing or heating fixtures or facilities or appurtenances of such building are either deteriorated, damaged, destroyed or removed so that such building offends the aesthetic character of the immediate neighborhood or produces blight or deterioration by reason of such condition, the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer shall issue a written notice respecting the existence of such defect; such written notice shall be served on the owner of such building as set forth in subsection (1)(a) and shall direct the owner of such building to promptly remedy the defect within 30 days following the service of such notice. 
(c)  If an owner fails to remedy or improve the defect in accordance with the written notice furnished by the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer under subsection (b) within the 30-day period specified in the written notice, the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer shall apply to the circuit court of the county in which the building is located for an order determining that the building constitutes a public nuisance. As a part of the application for such order from the circuit court the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer shall file a verified petition which recites the giving of such written notice, the defect or defects in such building, the owner's failure to comply with the notice and such other pertinent facts as may be related thereto. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the owner of record or the owner's agent if an agent is in charge of the building and upon the holder of any encumbrance of record under subsection (1)(a) and the owner shall have 20 days following service upon the owner in which to reply to such petition. Upon application by the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer the circuit court shall set promptly the petition for hearing. Testimony shall be taken by the circuit court with respect to the allegations of the petition and denials contained in the verified answer. If the circuit court after hearing the evidence with respect to the petition and the answer determines that the building constitutes a public nuisance, the court shall issue promptly an order directing the owner of the building to remedy the defect and to make such repairs and alterations as may be required. The court shall set a reasonable period of time in which the defect shall be remedied and the repairs or alterations completed. A copy of the order shall be served upon the owner as provided in subsection (1)(a). The order of the circuit court shall state in the alternative that, if the order of the court is not complied with within the time fixed by the court, the court will appoint a receiver or authorize the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer to proceed to raze and remove the building and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition under subsection (d). 
(d)  If the order of the circuit court under subsection (c) is not complied with within the time fixed by the court under subsection (c), the court shall authorize the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer to raze and remove the building and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition or shall appoint a disinterested person to act as receiver of the property to do either of the following within a reasonable period of time set by the court: 
1.  Remedy the defect and make any repairs and alterations necessary to meet the standards required by the building code or any health order. A receiver appointed under this subdivision, with the approval of the circuit court, may borrow money against and mortgage the property held in receivership as security in any amount necessary to remedy the defect and make the repairs and alterations. For the expenses incurred to remedy the defect and make the repairs and alterations necessary under this subdivision, the receiver shall have a lien upon the property. At the request of and with the approval of the owner, the receiver may sell the property at a price equal to at least the appraisal value of the property plus the cost of any repairs made under this subdivision. The selling owner shall be liable for such costs. 
2.  Secure and sell the building to a buyer who demonstrates to the circuit court an ability and intent to rehabilitate the building and to cause the building to be reoccupied in a legal manner. 
(e)  1. 
Any receiver appointed under subsection (d) shall collect all rents and profits accruing from the property held in receivership and pay all costs of management, including all general and special real estate taxes or assessments and interest payments on first mortgages on the property. A receiver under subsection (d) shall apply moneys received from sale of property held in receivership to pay all debts due on the property in the order set by law and shall pay any balance to the selling owner if the circuit court approves. 
2.  The circuit court shall set the fees and bond of a receiver appointed under subsection (d) and may discharge the receiver as the court deems appropriate. 
3.  Nothing in this subsection relieves the owner of any property for which a receiver has been appointed under subsection (d) from any civil or criminal responsibility or liability except that the receiver shall have civil and criminal responsibility and liability for all matters and acts directly under the receiver's authority or performed at his or her discretion. 
4.  If a defect is not remedied and repairs and alterations are not made within the time limit set by the circuit court under subsection (d), the court shall order that the county health officer, chief of the inspection department or other designated officer proceed to raze and remove the building and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition. 
5.  All costs and disbursements with respect to razing, removing and restoration of the site under this subsection shall be as provided for under subsection (2)(a). 
(f)  Any building, which under subsection (b), either as a result of vandalism or for any other reason, is permitted to deteriorate or become dilapidated or blighted to the extent where windows, doors or other openings or plumbing or heating fixtures or facilities or appurtenances of such building, dwelling or structure are either damaged, destroyed or removed so that such building, dwelling or structure offends the aesthetic character of the immediate neighborhood and produces blight or deterioration by reason of such condition, is a public nuisance. 
(7) (a) In this subsection: 
1.  Cost of repairs includes the estimated cost of repairs that are necessary to comply with applicable building codes, or other ordinances or regulations, governing the repair or renovation of a historic building. 
2.  Historic building means any building, structure or object listed on, or any building, structure or object within and contributing to a historic district listed on, the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin, the state register of historic places or a list of historic places maintained by the city. 
3.  Municipality means the City of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. 
(b)  The state historical society shall notify the city of any historic building located in the city. If a historic district lies within the city, the historical society shall furnish to the city a map delineating the boundaries of the district. 
(c)  If an order is issued under this section to raze and remove a historic building and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition, an application is made for a permit to raze and remove a historic building and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition or a municipality intends to raze and remove a municipally owned historic building and restore the site to a dust-free and erosion-free condition, the city shall notify the state historical society of the order, application or intent. No historic building may be razed and removed nor the site restored to a dust-free and erosion-free condition for 30 days after the notice is given. During the 30-day period, the state historical society shall have access to the historic building to create or preserve a historic record. 
(d)  If the city council, inspector of buildings or designated officer determines that the cost of repairs to a historic building would be less than 85 percent of the assessed value of the building divided by the ratio of the assessed value to the recommended value as last published by the department of revenue for the city, such repairs shall be presumed reasonable.

Chapter 23 - FLOODPLAIN ZONING CODE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1177-1006, adopted Oct. 17, 2006, repealed and recreated chapter 23, which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the 1992 Code, in its entirety to read as herein set out. 

23.01 - Statutory authorization, finding of fact, statement of purpose, title and general provisions. 
(1)  Statutory authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23, Wis. Stats., for villages and cities; §§ 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694, Wis. Stats., for counties; and the requirements in § 87.30, Wis. Stats. 
(2)  Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(3)  Statement of purpose. This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(a)  Protect life, health and property; 
(b)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(d)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(f)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(g)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(h)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(i)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(4)  Title. This chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Code for the City of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin". 
(5)  General provisions. 
(a)  Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. 
Note- Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the flood insurance rate map. 
(b)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Sturgeon Bay Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the flood insurance study (FIS) or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the community development department office, City of Sturgeon Bay. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
1.  Door County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55029C0458C, 55029C0459C, 55029C0460C, 55029C0470C, 55029C0476C, 55029C0478C, 55029C0479C, 55029C0486C, 55029C0487C and 55029C0491C dated March 2, 2009; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Door County, Wisconsin and incorporated areas dated March 2, 2009 (volume number 55029CV000A); 
2.  Floodplain study appendix: All DNR- and FEMA-approved floodplain maps, flood profiles, floodway data tables, regional or base flood elevations and other information located in the appendix on page ___ of this ordinance [sic]. The community shall provide the most up to date appendix to the DNR and FEMA regional offices. 
(c)  Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into districts as follows: 
1.  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
2.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
3.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
4.  The flood storage district (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(d)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in [subparagraphs] 1 and 2 [below]. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 23.08. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection 23.07(3)(c) and the criteria in [subparagraphs] 1. and 2. below. 
1.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
2.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the department [DNR]. 
Note- Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to subsection 23.08(1)(f). 
(e)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section 23.08. 
Note- This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC). 
(f)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies. 
(h)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
1.  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694, Wis. Stats., for counties; § 62.23, Wis. Stats., for cities; or § 61.35, Wis. Stats., for villages; or § 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relates to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(j)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter. 
(k)  Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed areas. The Door County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
(m)  General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a floodprone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1177-1006, 10-17-06; Ord. No. 1235-0209, § 1, 2-17-09) 
23.02 - General standards applicable to all floodplain districts. 
(1)  Hydraulic and hydrologic analysis. 
(a)  Except as allowed in paragraph (c) below, no floodplain development shall: 
1.  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, increasing regional flood height; or 
2.  Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.01 foot. 
(b)  The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of paragraph (c) are met. 
(c)  Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments are made to this chapter, the official floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in accordance with section 23.08. 
Note- This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood elevations as shown on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR. 
(2)  Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the department [DNR] and FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.

23.05 - Other floodplain districts. 
    Other floodplain districts may be established under the ordinance and reflected on the floodplain zoning map. These districts may include general floodplain districts and flood storage districts. 
(1)  General floodplain district (GFP). 
(a)  Applicability. The provisions for this district shall apply to all floodplains for which flood profiles are not available or where flood profiles are available but floodways have not been delineated. Floodway and floodfringe districts shall be delineated when adequate data is available. 
(b)  Permitted uses. Pursuant to subsection 23.05(1)(d), it shall be determined whether the proposed use is located within a floodway or floodfringe area. Those uses permitted in floodway (subsection 23.03(2)) and floodfringe areas (subsection 23.04(2)) are allowed within the general floodplain district, according to the standards of paragraph (c), provided that all permits or certificates required under subsection 23.07(1) have been issued. 
(c)  Standards for development in the general floodplain district . Section 23.03 applies to floodway areas, section 23.04 applies to floodfringe areas. The rest of this chapter applies to either district. 
(d)  Determining floodway and floodfringe limits. Upon receiving an application for development within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator shall: 
1.  Require the applicant to submit two copies of an aerial photograph or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to the general floodplain district limits, stream channel, and existing floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and flood proofing measures; 
2.  Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information deemed necessary by the department to evaluate the effects of the proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation and to determine floodway boundaries: 
a.  A typical valley cross-section showing the stream channel, the floodplain adjoining each side of the channel, the cross-sectional area to be occupied by the proposed development, and all historic high water information; 
b.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information; 
c.  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream; 
d.  Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage, water supply and sanitary facilities. 
3.  Transmit one copy of the information described in subparagraphs 1. and 2. to the department regional office along with a written request for technical assistance to establish regional flood elevations and, where applicable, floodway data. Where the provisions of subparagraph 23.07(1)(b)3. apply, the applicant shall provide all required information and computations to delineate floodway boundaries and the effects of the project on flood elevations. 
(2)  Flood storage district. The flood storage district delineates that portion of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher flood elevations. 
(a)  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the flood storage district (FSD), as shown on the official floodplain zoning maps. 
(b)  Permitted uses. Any use or development which occurs in a flood storage district must meet the applicable requirements in subsection 23.04(3). 
(c)  Standards for development in flood storage districts. 
1.  Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal or greater than 0.01 of a foot in the height of the regional flood. 
2.  No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the predevelopment ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage. 
3.  If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage district, on this waterway, is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplain storage, as per subsection 23.08(1) of this chapter. 
4.  No area may be removed from the flood storage district unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain.

    Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.

    Unnecessary hardship means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance. 
    Variance means an authorization by the board of appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watershed means the entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
    Water surface profile means a graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.

In the event that a change in either state or federal law would allow the city to increase the franchise fee above five percent of the grantee's gross revenues, the grantee shall not be liable for such increase until the city shall give grantee written notice of such change in the law. The franchise fee payment shall be in addition to any other payment owed to the city by the grantee and shall not be construed as payment in lieu of municipal property taxes or other state, county or local taxes. 
(3)  Cable communication fund. Any funds retained in the cable communication fund in excess of sums required to pay cable communication and PEG expenses for the current year shall be subject to such transfers or uses as deemed appropriate by the common council.

(4)  Method of computations; interest. 
(a)  Sales taxes or other taxes levied directly on a per subscription basis and collected by the grantee shall be deducted from the local annual gross revenues before computation of sums due the city is made. Payments due the city under the provisions of subsection (2) above shall be computed annually as of December 31 for the preceding year and shall be paid semi-annually by September 30 and March 31. The March 31 payment shall be paid simultaneously with the filing of annual reports required in section 26.15 at the office of the city clerk during his regular business hours. The payment period shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise or any renewal date. The city shall be furnished a statement with each payment, reflecting the local amounts of annual gross revenues, and the above charges, deductions and computations, for the annual payment period covered by the payment. 
(b)  If any payment is not made as required, interest on the amount due, as determined from the annual gross revenues as computed shall accrue from the date of the required submittal at an annual rate of 12 percent. The grantee shall pay an additional compensation to the city if the payment is late by 45 days or more. Such additional compensation shall be equal to two percent of the amount due in order to defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by the city by reason of the delinquent payment. 
(c)  The percentages designated in this section may be amended no more than once each year by the city council, consistent with increased costs for municipal facilities and supervision and applicable rules of other regulatory agencies. 
(5)  Rights of recomputation. No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the city. 
(6)  Alternative fee basis. In the event the franchise fee or payment established under this chapter is ruled unconstitutional or unenforceable, the city may impose and collect an equivalent charge on any legally permissible basis, provided such charge does not exceed the previously allowed limit on franchise fees or payments.

(c)  Refunds. As specified in the FCC regulations, the city council may order the grantee to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates which have been found to be unreasonable. Before ordering the grantee to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the city council shall give the grantee notice and opportunity to comment. 
(d)  Basic service rate increases and equipment charges. The grantee shall not file for increases in equipment charges and/or basic service rates more often than allowed under FCC regulations. All subsequent requests by the grantee for increases in equipment changes and/or basic service rates shall be subject to the procedures outlined in this section.

For that part of an extension that is longer than 600 feet, the grantee may charge the potential subscriber for the grantee's actual cost of that portion of the extension. Any amount paid by a subscriber for an extension under this subsection shall be refundable to that subscriber in the event that, during the subsequent three-year period, the area reaches a density level of 25 dwelling units per strand mile. In no event, shall the amount of the refund exceed the amount paid by the subscriber for the extension.

    No owner, lessee, occupant or other person in charge of an historic structure or historic site, a vacant property or an improvement parcel within an historic preservation district shall undertake an alteration of such property, permit any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the commission.

The application shall be accompanied by a description or illustration of the proposed work that is of sufficient detail and scope to enable the commission to readily understand the nature of the proposed work. 
(2)  Upon receipt of an application, the commission shall review the project at its next regular meeting. The commission may find the project appropriate and grant a certificate at that time or it shall set a public hearing date within 30 days of its original review. When reviewing the certificate application, the commission shall consider: 
(a)  Whether, in the case of an historic structure, historic site or improvement within an historic preservation district, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the improvement upon which such work is to be done.

(5)  If the application for a certificate of appropriateness is disapproved or the applicant refuses to accept changes recommended by the commission, the commission shall notify the applicant of its decision by letter within 15 days. The applicant may then appeal the decision to the city council. Appeals shall be by a written request to the city council within 20 days after the mailing of the letter to the applicant of the commission's decision. The city council may then reverse or modify the decision of the commission if, after balancing the interest of the public in preserving the subject property and the interest of the owner in using it for his/her own purposes, the city council finds that, owing to unique conditions pertaining to the specific piece of property, failure to grant the certificate of appropriateness will preclude the reasonable use of the property or will cause serious hardship for the owner.

Stats., a tax is hereby imposed on the privilege and services of furnishing, at retail, of rooms or lodging to transients by hotel keepers, motel operators and other persons furnishing accommodations that are available to the public, irrespective of whether membership is required for the use of the accommodations. Such tax shall be at the rate of five and one-half percent of the gross receipts from such retail furnishing of rooms or lodgings. Such tax shall not be subject to the selective sales tax imposed by § 77.52 (2)(a)1., Wis. Stats., and may not be imposed upon sales to the Federal Government and persons listed under § 77.54 (9a), Wis. Stats. 
(b)  Taxation effective date. The effective date of the room tax shall be January 1, 2009. 
(c)  Room tax payment frequency. Room tax should be paid by the lodging property on a monthly basis. It should be paid by the end of the month following the month in which it was collected unless the end of the month falls on a Saturday or Sunday, which would make it due on Monday. The room tax is owed to the local municipality which imposed the tax, but the municipality directs that all checks be sent directly to the commission. If the room tax checks for all properties in a municipality are sent directly to the commission, the commission will send one check by the fifteenth of each month to the municipality for 30 percent of all room tax collected the previous month along with a report showing the amount of room tax collected from each lodging property. In the latter case, the commission does all the paperwork as part of their monitoring. 
(d)  Room tax responsibility. The correct amount of room tax shall accompany each lodging property's monthly tax return and be made payable to the Door County Tourism Zone Commission. If any person liable for any amount of tax under this agreement sells out their business or otherwise quits the business, their successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the commission that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If any person subject to the tax imposed by this agreement fails to withhold such amount of tax from the purchase price as required, they shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by them. 
(e)  Monthly room tax return. The monthly room tax return filed with the room tax payment by the lodging property shall contain the following information: Name of the business, physical address, postal address, municipality located within, name of the designated person filling out the return, month and year the return is for, total available rental units during the month (number of rental units in the facility multiplied by the days in the month or days they were open), number of rooms or units rented, total lodging sales for the month, room tax to be paid, (which should equal total lodging sales multiplied by the five and one-half percent room tax), and the signature of the person filling out this return, attesting to the accuracy. This information will allow the commission to judge the accuracy of the return, and, for the commission, with all returns in total, to judge the effectiveness of the tourism promotion. The commission shall establish the form of the monthly tax return as either a paper and/or electronic document. 
(f)  Delinquent room tax. Delinquent room tax returns shall be subject to a twenty-five dollar late filing fee. The tax imposed pursuant to this chapter shall become delinquent if not paid by the due date of the return. A forfeiture of 25 percent of the room tax due or $5,000.00 whichever is less, of the tax imposed, is hereby established and due and owing in the event that the room tax is not paid within 30 days after the due date of the return. To prevent payment omissions, within ten days of a past due room tax payment, the commission should send a written past due statement to the designated person or agent at the late paying lodging business. In addition to this forfeiture, all unpaid taxes under this chapter shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the due date of the return until received and deposited by the commission. Whenever the commission has probable cause to believe that the correct amount of room tax has not been assessed or that the tax return is not correct, or that the tax has not been paid, the commission is authorized to examine and inspect the books, records, memoranda and property of any person in order to verify the tax liability of that person or another person. The commission shall make an estimate of the amount of tax owed. Based on this estimate, the commission shall add a penalty of ten percent thereof. If a person files a false or fraudulent return with the intent of either case to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this ordinance, a penalty of 50 percent shall be added to the tax required to be paid, exclusive of interest and other penalties. If any past due tax, interest or penalties are due at the beginning of a calendar year, a new room tax-lodging permit will not be issued by the commission unless satisfactory financial arrangements have been made with the commission to satisfy payment. 
(g)  Confidentiality of reports. All room tax returns, schedules, exhibits, writings or audit reports relating to such returns, on file with the commission and the municipality are deemed confidential pursuant to § 66.0615(3), Wis. Stats., except they may divulge their contents to the following, and no others: 
1.  The person who filed the return. 
2.  Officers, employees or agents of the _______ treasurer and the commission. 
3.  Other persons for the use in the discharge of duties imposed by law, or in the discharge of the duties of their office (unless otherwise prohibited by law), or by order of a court. 
(h)  Initial adoption year exemptions. The following exemptions shall automatically expire on December 31 of the calendar year of adoption. During the period of time from the adoption of the room tax ordinance until December 31 of that calendar year, there may be exemptions to the collection of the room tax subject to audit. Any person or business otherwise required to file a return and make a payment under this agreement, will be allowed an exemption from the requirement to collect and pay room tax for any signed contract dated prior to the adoption of the agreement in which the contract guarantees the lodging rates and the applicable taxes. This also applies to any gift certificate purchase before the adoption of this agreement, which is not for a fixed dollar amount, but, instead, for the amount paid, guarantees a particular lodging rate and the applicable taxes. This exemption does not apply to reservations made before the adoption of this agreement, which are not binding contracts. The commission shall establish provisions for the proper reporting of these exemptions. 
(4)  Lodging establishments to be licensed. 
(a)  License required. Any party supplying transient lodging in the City of Sturgeon Bay shall obtain and maintain a permit from the commission permitting the rental of accommodations. No accommodations shall be rented or available for rental for a period of less than 30 days by any party not possessing a lodging permit issued by the commission. 
(b)  Permit application. Any party furnishing lodging accommodations to transient guests in the City of Sturgeon Bay shall annually file, on or before the end of the year, with the commission, an application to operate each place of business subject to this chapter. There shall be no cost for the filing of the application for the permit. The application form shall include, at minimum, the following information: 
1.  The name of the business under which the person, partnership or corporation transacts business or intends to transact business. (This name shall agree with that used for sales tax permits.) 
2.  The name of the agent for the business or other person designated as responsible to remit the room tax, and means to contact this person, including email address, postal address, telephone number, fax number and cell phone number. 
3.  The physical and mailing address of the business. 
4.  Number of rental units at the location for each month of the year during which the business is operating. 
5.  The signature of the person designated in item b. above. 
(c)  Permit review and issuance. The commission may accept the application, review it for accuracy and issue the permit. The permit shall not be assignable. The permit shall only be valid for the person named on the application as being responsible to remit the room tax. In cases where that person should change or the ownership should change during the life of the permit, the application and issuance of a new permit shall be necessary. 
(d)  Penalty for failure to obtain and maintain a permit for the rental of accommodations. Any party in violation of the terms of this chapter by failing to obtain or maintain a lodging permit, when such permit is required, shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $20.00 nor more than $100.00 for each violation. Each room or unit separately rented or offered for rent, and each day of such rental or offer for rental of such unit shall be a separate violation.

    Section 1. Findings and Policy. The City of Sturgeon Bay (the city) owns and operates an electric utility pursuant to §§ 66.065 and 66.068, Wis. Stats., and a combined water and sewer utility pursuant to §§ 66.065, 66.068 and 66.077, Wis. Stats. In order to achieve the goal of rendering the best utility service possible in the most efficient manner, the city has chosen for many years to operate, manage and control its electric utility and sewer and water utilities through one commission and by employing the same superintendent and staff, sharing facilities and equipment and consolidating the books and records of the utilities. Formally combining the city's electric and sewer and water utilities as a single public utility will enable the city to continue the benefits of current joint operating practices, realize further efficiencies of operation and management, and strengthen and enhance significantly the overall creditworthiness of the city's utility operations for future mortgage revenue bond financings and other purposes. The council finds that the management, structure and control of the city's utility operations and property is a matter of local affairs and government and that combination of the city's electric and water and sewer utilities into a single public utility is in the best interests of the city and users of the city's utilities and is for the good order of the city, its commercial benefit, and the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
    Section 2. Authority. This ordinance is enacted as a part of the Charter of the city pursuant to § 66.01(1), Wis. Stats., and article XI, section 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution. Pursuant to § 66.01(4), Wis. Stats., the city elects not to be governed by § 66.068(6), Wis. Stats., but only insofar as such section may be construed to limit, subject to the exception created by § 66.077, Wis. Stats., combination of public utilities of a municipality to utilities acquired as a single enterprise. This ordinance also is enacted pursuant to the powers of the city under § 62.11(5), Wis. Stats. 
    Section 3. Combination. The electric utility of the city and the water and sewer utility of the city are hereby combined into a single public utility to be known as Sturgeon Bay Utilities. Sturgeon Bay Utilities shall, in all respects, remain subject to all of the provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes and the municipal ordinances of the city as they pertain to the operation and management thereof. 
    Section 4. Effective Date. This is a Charter Ordinance and shall take effect 60 days after its passage and publication, unless within such 60-day period a referendum petition shall be filed in accordance with § 66.01, Wis. Stats., in which event this ordinance shall not take effect until submitted to a referendum and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon. The clerk is hereby instructed to publish this ordinance as a class 1 notice, under ch. 985, Wis. Stats., to record this ordinance in a permanent book kept for that purpose, with a statement of the manner of its adoption, and to file a certified copy thereof with the secretary of state. 
    Section 5. Severability. Each section of this ordinance is severable and, if any section shall be found illegal or unconstitutional, the remainder shall be of full force and effect. 
    Section 6. Effect on Creditors. This ordinance is a confirmation of existing practice and shall not be construed in any way which will affect adversely the rights of existing creditors of the city.

This Charter Ordinance is to amend Charter Ordinance 10 by separating the sewer utility from the combined Sturgeon Bay Utilities formed by Charter Ordinance 10. Formally separating the sewer utility from the combined electric and water utility will allow the city to adjust sewer rates as needed without prior Public Service Commission of Wisconsin review absent a customer or bondholder complaint.

Stats., the city elects that its sewer utility not be governed by § 66.077, Wis. Stats., and not be subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin except pursuant to § 66.912(5), Wis. Stats. Therefore, the sewer utility is hereby separated from the combined electric and water utility. This ordinance also is enacted pursuant to the powers of the city under § 62.11(5), Wis. Stats. 
    Section 3. Separation of Sewer Utility. Charter Ordinance 10 is hereby amended to the extent provided herein. The sewer utility is hereby separated from the single public utility known as the Sturgeon Bay Utilities and shall be known hereafter as the Sturgeon Bay Sewer Utility. The Sturgeon Bay Utilities consisting of the electric and water utilities shall, in all respects, remain subject to all of the provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes and the municipal ordinances of the city as they pertain to the operation and management thereof. 
    The Sturgeon Bay Sewer Utility shall remain subject to § 66.912(5), Wis. Stats., and the municipal ordinances of the city as they pertain to the operation and management thereof.

Chapter 33 - STORMWATER UTILITY MANAGEMENT CODE 
PREFACE AND ADMINISTRATION 

33.100 - Foreword. 
    The city council (hereinafter "council") of Sturgeon Bay does hereby ordain that chapter 33 of the Code of Ordinances of Sturgeon Bay is created to read as follows: 
(Ord. No. 1162-0306, § 1, 3-21-06) 
33.101 - Purpose; intent. 
(1)  Purpose. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this chapter to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; prevent and control soil erosion; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth, by minimizing the amount of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff or discharged from land disturbing construction activity to waters of the state in Sturgeon Bay. 
(b)  The general purpose of this chapter is to establish long-term, post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
1.  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
2.  Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
3.  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(2)  Intent. 
(a)  It is the intent of the council that this chapter regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This chapter may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level storm water management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale.

(a)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(b)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacterial, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(c)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(d)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(e)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(f)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(g)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.

5.  Pre-development conditions shall assume "good hydrologic conditions" for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent methodology. The meaning of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55. 
Hydrologic parameters shall be selected based on soil groups using the Door County Soil Survey (United States Soil Conservation Service/Natural Resource Service), field observations and supporting laboratory analysis. 
When pre-development land cover is cropland, rather than using TR-55 values for cropland, the runoff curve numbers in Table 33.303 A shall be used. 
TABLE 33.303 A 
Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve Numbers Hydrologic Soil Group A B C D Runoff Curve Number 
Cropland Areas 66 74 80 82 Runoff Curve Number 
Meadow/Grass Areas 60* 60* 71 78  
* 60 is the minimum due to runoff on frozen soils. 
The runoff curve numbers for land which was cropland within the last ten years will be based on a typical dairy farm crop rotation (CCOHHH). Land which has not been used for crops within the last ten years should use the parameters that describe the actual conditions; however RCN may not be larger than those for cropland. 
6.  This subsection 33.303(3)(b) does not apply to any of the following: 
a.  A post-construction site where the change in hydrology due to development does not increase the existing surface water elevation at any point within the downstream receiving water by more than 0.01 of a foot for the two-year, 24-hour storm event. 
b.  Riparian properties. Lands immediately adjacent to, and discharging directly to Sturgeon Bay without flowing over or through a municipally owned separate storm sewer or stormwater conveyance system. 
(c)  Conveyance. All stormwater conveyance systems within proposed developments shall be improved to completely contain peak flow rates as described below. Calculations for determining peak flows for conveyance system sizing shall be based on the existing or future land use conditions for site areas (whichever result in the highest peak flows), and the future proposed land use conditions for the on-site areas. 
1.  Open channels. For publicly owned or maintained open channel conveyance systems, the peak flow rate from the 25-year rainfall event shall be completely contained in the channel banks. 
a.  For storm events between the ten-year and 100-year, 24-hour event, ponding may be contained within existing or proposed street right-of-way as approved by the director. In no case shall the depth of water exceed 12-inches at the outer edge of pavement or six-inches at the road crown, whichever is less. 
b.  The 100-year storm runoff flow path outside of the normal conveyance system must not impact structural improvements on property. 
2.  Emergency overland flow routes for all storm water facilities shall be provided that discharged flows do not exceed the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and endanger downstream property or public safety. 
3.  Sewer pipes. 
a.  For publicly owned or maintained storm sewer conveyance systems, the peak flow rate from the ten-year rainfall event shall be completely contained within the pipes with no "surcharging" or pressurized flow. The system performance shall be evaluated for the 25-year rainfall event. 
b.  For privately owned or maintained storm sewer conveyance systems, the peak flow rate from the ten-year rainfall event shall be completely contained within the pipes with no "surcharging" or pressurized flow. The system performance shall be evaluated for the 25-year rainfall event. 
4.  Drainage from off-site tributary areas shall be conveyed in the improvements. The site improvements shall not block or impede drainage from off-site areas. 
5.  Upstream drainage. Stormwater runoff from upstream of the development shall be conveyed through or diverted around the subject property to limit erosion and flooding. 
6.  Discharges. 
a.  All discharges will be restricted to public drainage systems (including storm sewers and open channels) or to waters of the state. 
b.  Redirecting drainage from original location. 
(i)  The applicant is responsible for obtaining all necessary easements, agreements, property interests and approvals from adjacent property owners regarding discharging either drainage improvements or "redirected" drainage discharges onto private lands (when predevelopment drainage had previously not flowed onto the subject property). 
(ii)  Where site development or redevelopment involves changes in direction, increases in peak rate and/or total volume of runoff from a site (exceeding existing/pre-development two-year event peak discharges), the director may require the responsible party to make appropriate legal arrangements with affected property owners concerning the prevention of endangerment to property or public safety, which shall include an indemnify and hold harmless the city. 
(d)  Infiltration: BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with the following, except as provided in subparagraphs 33.303(3)(d)5. through 8. 
1.  For residential developments one of the following shall be met: 
a.  Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 90 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
b.  Infiltrate 25 percent of the post-development runoff from the two-year 24 hour design storm with a type II distribution. Separate curve numbers for pervious and impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff volumes and not composite curve numbers as defined in TR-55. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
2.  For nonresidential development, including commercial, industrial and institutional development, one of the following shall be met: 
a.  Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
b.  Infiltrate ten percent of the runoff from the two-year 24-hour design storm with a type II distribution. Separate curve numbers for pervious and impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff volumes, and not composite curve numbers as defined in TR-55.

9.  Groundwater protection. 
a.  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this paragraph shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code chapter NR 140. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
b.  Notwithstanding subparagraph a., the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
(e)  Protective areas: 
1.  "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this paragraph, "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location.

    Except as otherwise provided, any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a penalty as provided in section 25.04 of this Municipal Code. 
(Ord. No. 1256-0710, § 5, 7-6-10) 
Chapter 35 - CODE OF CONDUCT 

35.01 - Purpose. 
(1)  It is the policy of the City of Sturgeon Bay to uphold, promote, and demand the highest standards of ethics from its elected officials. Members of the common council and mayor shall maintain the utmost standards of personal integrity, trustfulness, honesty, and fairness in carrying out their public duties, avoiding any improprieties in their roles as public servants, complying with all applicable laws, and never using their city position or authority improperly or for personal gain or the gain of affiliated organizations. Chapter 36 of this Code [addresses] ethical duties where personal gain, conflict and fiduciary interests are concerned. This chapter addresses matters of good conduct and ethical and responsible behavior as well as duties and actions with other elected officials, employees of the city and members of the public. 
(2)  The City of Sturgeon Bay and its elected officials share a commitment to ethical conduct and service to the City of Sturgeon Bay, both as a municipal corporation and community. This Code has been created to provide all city officials with clear guidelines for carrying out their responsibilities in their relationships with each other, city staff, the citizens of Sturgeon Bay, and with all other private and governmental entities. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.02 - Elected official conduct interactions with others. 
(1)  The common council and mayor (the mayor and council shall, for purposes of this chapter be referred to as "council") have decided to set the policies for the city governing the decorum and conduct during public meetings. The council recognizes certain types of conduct are conducive to the effective and efficient operation of government and the effective debate and others are disruptive and impede the process of government. 
(2)  The council is composed of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds, personalities, values, opinions, and goals. Despite this diversity, all choose to serve in public office and, therefore, have the obligation to preserve and protect the well-being of the community and its citizens. In all cases, this common goal must be acknowledged, and the council must recognize that certain behavior is counterproductive, while other behavior will lead to effective communication and governance. The council also recognizes that insofar as this chapter regulates disruptive conduct in public meetings, it is not intended to place any limitation or regulation on the content of the speech directed toward debate and the conduct of the business of government. 
(a)  Use formal titles. While in session, the council shall refer to one another formally as mayor, council president, or alderperson followed by the individual's last name. A small act of formality such as using titles (Mr., Ms. Alder, councilman, etc.) will help both members of the council and public maintain a professional and businesslike manner during public meetings. 
(b)  Use civility and decorum in discussions and debate. 
1.  Difficult questions, tough challenges to a particular point of view, and criticism of ideas and information are legitimate elements of free democracy in action. Every council member has the right to an individual opinion, which should be respected by the other council members. Recognizing that council members have the right to present their arguments in their entirety, council members shall not be hostile, degrading, or defamatory when debating a contentious issue as such conduct disrupts the debate and the ability of the council to perform its obligation to the public. Council members should assume the other members of the council have the appropriate motives and interest of the public in mind and should not criticize differing opinions because they believe them to be lacking in judgment or motivated by mistaken beliefs or information. 
2.  Council members are not to make belligerent, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or personally disparaging comments in public meetings or during individual encounters. Assaultive behavior such as shouting or physical actions that could be reasonably construed by the target as threatening or demeaning will not be accepted. If a council member is personally offended by the remarks of another council member, the offended member should make a note of the actual words used and call for a "point of personal privilege" that challenges the other council member to justify or apologize for the language used. 
(c)  Honor the role of the chair in maintaining order. It is the responsibility of the mayor, as chair of the council, or the chair of any standing committee, to keep the comments of council members on track during council meetings. Council members should honor efforts by the mayor or chair to focus discussion on current agenda items. If there is disagreement about the agenda or the mayor's or chair's actions, those objections should be voiced politely and with reason, following parliamentary procedure. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.03 - Elected official conduct with city staff. 
(1)  Governance of the city relies on the cooperative efforts of elected officials who set policy and the city staff who implement and administer the council's policies. Every effort should be made to be cooperative and show mutual respect for the contributions made by each other for the good of the community. 
(a)  Treat all staff as professionals. Council members shall treat all staff as professionals. Clear, honest communication that respects the abilities, experience, and dignity of each individual is expected. Council members should refer to staff by their title followed by the individual's last name in public meetings when first introduced. 
(b)  Never publicly demean or personally attack an individual employee. Council members shall not demean, slander or personally attack an employee regarding the employee's job performance in public. Any and all employee performance issues shall be forwarded to the employee's supervisor, human resources director or the city attorney through private correspondence or conversation. Council members do not have the authority to individually determine whether an employee's conduct is in violation of city rules or policies. Employee disciplinary matters are subject to the city employment manual and the confidentiality protections of § 19.85, Wis. Stats. 
(c)  Do not supersede administrative authority. [For purposes of this document, the term "administrative authority" includes the duties of the mayor and city administrator as described in the Wisconsin Statutes and City of Sturgeon Bay Code of Ordinances]. Unless otherwise provided by law or in this Code, no members of the common council, shall attempt to supersede the administration's powers and duties. No member thereof shall give orders to any subordinate of the department heads, either publicly or privately, unless those directives have been directly authorized and sanctioned by the council or a committee authorized to give such directive. Council members shall not attempt to influence or coerce city staff concerning either their actions or recommendations to council about personnel, purchasing, awarding contracts, selection of consultants, processing of development applications, the granting of city licenses and permits, or policies that the common council may pursue. Nothing in this section shall be construed, however, as prohibiting the council while from fully and freely discussing with or suggesting to the department heads anything pertaining to city affairs or the interests of the city. 
(d)  Do not solicit political support from staff. Council members shall not solicit any type of political support (financial contributions, display of posters or lawn signs, name on support list, collection of petition signatures, etc.) from city staff while at work or imply assistance is necessary as a term or condition of continued employment or favor by the council member. City staff may, as private citizens within their constitutional rights, support political candidates, but all such activities must be done away from the workplace. Photographs of uniformed city employees shall not be used in political ads. 
(e)  Favors. Council members shall not use their office to attempt to induce special favors for themselves or constituents, such as asking for a ticket or ordinance violation to be "fixed." Or giving priority to particular requests in exchange for favorable consideration in the future. 
(f)  Undermining official actions. Notwithstanding the mayor's authority to veto, once the council has made a determination on a matter and has published that decision to the extent required by law, the council members may not use their position to intimidate or delay or hinder staff in their responsibility to carry out the direction of the council. 
(g)  Harassing and intimidating actions prohibited. Council members shall not engage in a course of conduct or repeatedly commit acts which harass or intimidate a staff member or other council member and which serve no legitimate purpose or serve a purpose contrary to the directives of this chapter. Nor shall any council member engage in verbal or physical conduct that demeans or shows hostility or aversion toward another person because of his/her race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, or other legally protected status, or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates. Illegal harassment will be determined through the standard of whether a reasonable person from the victim's point of view would consider the conduct to be harassing or intimidating. Gaining an unfair advantage as a benefit of office or to intimidate staff members or other council members to follow a course of conduct they are not required [to] under the direction of the council are expressly not a legitimate purpose under this provision. 
1.  Examples of prohibited harassing and intimidating actions include: Verbal and/or physical abuse, unwelcome physical contact, epithets (name-calling), slurs, threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts, vulgar or derogatory language, display of offensive or graphic cartoons, written or printed materials, use of electronic communications such as e-mail or internet for sending or downloading unwelcome or offensive material, mimicry, lewd or offensive gestures or pranks, telling of jokes offensive to the above protected class members. Where such conduct has the purpose or effect of (1) creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; (2) unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance; or otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment opportunities. Such conduct is strictly prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.04 - Elected official conduct towards the public. 
(1)  In public meetings. Any conduct that interferes with or obstructs the ability of the public to participate in the public forum is disruptive to the operation of government. All members of the public shall, subject to the rules of the council governing the manner of public participation and any open meetings restrictions, be given a fair and equal right to present their views. No council member shall interfere with or obstruct such participation. 
(a)  Be welcoming to speakers and treat them with care and respect. For many citizens, speaking in front of council is a new and difficult experience. Under such circumstances, many are nervous. Council members are expected to treat citizens with care and respect during public hearings. Council members should commit full attention to the speakers or any materials relevant to the topic at hand. Comments and non-verbal expressions should be appropriate, respectful, and professional. 
(b)  Be fair and equitable in allocating public comment time to individual speakers. The mayor will determine and announce time limits on speakers at the start of the public hearing process. Generally, each speaker will be allocated three minutes, with applicants and appellants or their designated representative allowed more time. If many speakers are anticipated, the mayor may shorten the time limit and/or ask speakers to limit themselves to new information and points of view not already covered by previous speakers. Each speaker may only speak once during the public hearing unless the council requests additional clarification later in the process. After the close of the public hearing, no additional public testimony will be accepted unless the council reopens the public hearing for a limited and specific purpose. 
(c)  Ask for clarification, but avoid debate and argument with the public. Only the mayor, not other council members, may interrupt a speaker during a presentation to the city council. (Questions are to be reserved to the conclusion of the presentation). However, other council members may ask the mayor for a point of order if the speaker is off the topic or exhibiting behavior or language the council member finds disturbing. Questions directed by council members to members of the public testifying should seek to clarify or expand information, not to criticize or debate. 
(d)  Follow parliamentary procedure in conducting public meetings. The city attorney serves as advisory parliamentarian for the city and is available to answer questions or interpret situations according to parliamentary procedures. Final rulings on parliamentary procedure are made by the mayor or committee chair, subject to the appeal of the full council or committee per Robert's Rules of Order. 
(2)  Outside public meetings. 
(a)  Make no promise on behalf of the city or council in unofficial settings. 
1.  Council members will frequently be asked to explain a council action or to give their opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community. It is appropriate to give a brief overview of city policy and to refer to city staff for further information. While a council member can share their position on an issue, the member should not speculate on the outcome of an issue in a manner that may mislead or confuse a constituent. 
2.  Council members must ensure that while expressing their own opinions they do not mislead any listener into believing that their individual opinion is that of the entire council, unless the council has taken a vote on that issue and the council member's opinion is the same as the decision made by the council. Likewise, no council member should state in writing that council member's position in a way that implies it is the position of the entire city council. A council member has the right to state a personal opinion, and has the right to indicate that he/she is stating such as a member of the council, but must always clarify that he/she is not speaking on behalf of the city or the council unless authorized by the council to do so. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.05 - Elected official conduct with other organizations. 
(1)  Be clear about representing the city or personal interests. If a council member appears before another governmental agency or other organization to give a statement on an issue, the council member must clearly state whether his or her statement reflects personal opinion or is the official adopted stance of the city. 
(a)  Council members must inform the council of their involvement in an outside organization if that organization is or may become involved in any issue within the city's jurisdiction that is before the city for consideration. If an individual council member publicly represents or speaks on behalf of another organization whose position differs from the city's official position on any issue, the council member must clearly communicate the organization upon whose behalf they are speaking. If the interest of an organization that they hold an office in, or employed by is not consistent with the city's position, the council member must withdraw from voting or participating in debate, discussion or negotiation upon any action that has bearing upon the conflicting issue. 
(2)  Representation of the city on intergovernmental commissions and other outside entities. Council members serving on committees or boards as a city representative for outside entities or agencies shall properly communicate with other council members on issues pertinent to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.06 - Elected official conduct with boards and commissions. 
(1)  Limit contact with board and commission members to questions of clarification. Council members shall not contact a board or commission member to lobby on behalf of or in opposition to an individual, business, or developer for personal gain or for the benefit of a group, organization, entity of which they are a member except in open session when the public is allowed to speak, clarifying that their statement is not that of the council, but a personal view or opinion. Council members may contact board or commission members in order to clarify a position taken by the board or commission or a member thereof. Council members may respond to inquiries from board and commission members. 
(2)  Attendance at board or commission meetings that fall outside of the council appointments to various boards and commissions as part of their council duties. Council members may attend any board, committee or commission meeting, which are always open to any member of the public. However, they should be sensitive to the way their participation is viewed, especially if it is on behalf of an individual, business, or developer, which could be perceived as unfairly affecting the process and must avoid any participation in the matter if § 946.13, Wis. Stats. or other conflict provision is applicable. Periodically a matter of interest to a council member will come before a commission, committee, or board for approval before it is considered by the common council in a quasi-judicial capacity or other manner where the council will be called upon to make an impartial decision. Testifying at a hearing or commenting on, either in support of or opposed to a particular matter before it is reviewed and acted on by the council can lead to arguments of bias and compromise the hearing process and eventual outcome. Avoid putting yourself in the position of stating your opinion on the worth of a project, policy or action until the testimony is concluded and the matter properly before the common council. 
(3)  Be respectful of diverse opinions. A primary role of boards, committees, and commissions is to represent many points of view in the community and to provide the council with advice based on a full spectrum of concerns and perspectives. Council members must be fair and respectful to all citizens serving on boards, committees and commissions. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.07 - Elected official conduct with the media. 
(1)  Expression of positions on issue. When communicating with the media, council members should clearly differentiate between personal opinions and the official position of the city. Each council member represents one vote of seven and until a vote on any issue is taken, council members' positions are merely their own. Presenting personal opinions as those of the council inaccurately is misleading to the public. 
(2)  Discussions regarding city staff. Council members should not discuss personnel issues or other confidential matters regarding individual city staff in the media or in open session. Any issues pertaining to city staff should only be addressed directly to the department head, city attorney or human resources. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19) 
35.08 - Code of conduct complaint process. 
(1)  Procedure for filing complaints. 
(a)  Allegations of violations of this code of conduct shall be heard by the ethics board under the procedures provided in chapter 36 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 1, 5-21-19)

It directs disclosure by officials, board and committee members, employees, agents and candidates for city office of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. 
(b)  This code of ethics does not prohibit city officials from having other employment and financial interests.

(2)  Specific conflicts enumerated. 
(a)  Incompatible employment. No official, employee or agent shall engage in or accept private employment or render service for private interest when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair such official's, employee's or agent's independence, judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties, unless otherwise permitted by law and unless disclosure is made herein provided. 
(b)  Disclosure of confidential information.

Campaign contributions are an exception and should be carefully documented and handled in accordance with the provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes. 
3.  An elected or appointed official, employee or agent is not to accept hospitality if after consideration of the surrounding circumstances it could reasonably be concluded that such hospitality would not be extended were it not for the fact that the guest or a member of the guest's immediate family was a city official. Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses, informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this prohibition. This paragraph further shall not be construed to prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality from citizens for the purpose of supporting the candidate's campaign. 
4.  Gifts received by an elected or appointed official, employee or agent under unusual circumstances must be referred to the ethics board within ten days of receipt for recommended disposition.

(a)  Initiating action. Any city resident may initiate a review before the ethics board of the conduct of any official to be in violation of the city ethics code by filing a verified complaint, with the city clerk together with a processing fee in the amount of $100.00. Such verified complaint shall specify the activities of such officer or employee which are alleged to be in violation of the code. The clerk shall provide a form, created by the ethics board that may be used for such complaint that shall at a minimum require (1) the complainant's name, address and contact information; (2) the name and position of the city official who is the subject of the complaint; (3) the nature of the alleged violation, including the specific provision of this code allegedly violated, and (4) a statement of facts constituting the alleged violation and the dates on which, or period of time during which, the alleged violation occurred.

The complainant shall swear to the facts by oath before a notary public, or before the city clerk. The notary public or city clerk shall verify the signature. 
(c)  Limitation. A complaint under the code must be filed no later than one year from the date of discovery of the alleged violation. 
(2)  Delivery of the complaint and answer. The city attorney or in the event of conflict, a special counsel appointed by the ethics board, shall act as counsel to the ethics board. Upon receipt the clerk shall forward such complaint to the chair of the ethics board who will see to it that the officer or employee accused in the complaint is notified of fact that a complaint has been filed and served (in person or by certified mail) a copy of the complaint within 20 days of its filing. The accused party may file an answer to the complaint with the city clerk at the accused's option. 
(3)  Determination of probable cause. The chair also shall convene the ethics board within 30 days of the date of filing of the complaint with the clerk for the purpose of determining whether, when the employee or officer has acted in violation of the code. Such review shall be in closed session. The ethics board shall give the complaining party and the officer or employee named in the complaint notice of the meeting and may request clarification of the complaint or answer from either party. 
(a)  If the ethics board determines that no probable cause exists, it shall dismiss the complaint and notify the accused officer or employee, the complainant and such other persons as the board determines to have an interest. 
(b)  If the ethics board finds probable cause to believe a violation exists, it shall then proceed to hold a hearing as provided by this code. 
(c)  The ethics board may also, upon agreement of the complaining party and the officer or employee named in the complaint proceed to issue an advisory opinion on the facts alleged in the complaint in lieu of a hearing. 
(d)  The ethics board may direct the city attorney or special counsel to further investigate the facts stated in the verified complaint and report back to the board. 
(e)  The complaining party may withdraw the complaint prior to a finding of probable cause. If probable cause is found by the ethics board, the complaint may not be withdrawn without the consent of the ethics board which may, at its complete discretion, require the matter to continue to hearing with or without the consent of either party. 
(f)  The ethics board may compromise or settle any potential action for violation of the code. Whenever the board enters into a settlement agreement with an individual who is accused of a violation of the code, the board shall reduce the agreement to writing, together with a statement of the board's findings and reasons for entering into the agreement and shall retain the statement and agreement in its records for inspection. 
(4)  Hearing process. 
(a)  Notice of the finding of probable cause, notice of hearing and a copy of the complaint shall be sent to the accused officer or employee by certified mail at his last known post office address within ten days of the determination of probable cause. 
(b)  The evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled more than 20 days but less than 45 days from the postmarked date of the notice of hearing. The hearing may however be adjourned at the request of either party for good cause shown or the ethics board. 
(c)  Prior to the hearing date, the chair and the city attorney or designated counsel shall contact the parties for the purpose of a pre-hearing conference. At the pre-hearing conference, the parties shall disclose the witnesses they intend to call and any documentary evidence they intend to introduce. The parties request any subpoenas and discuss any other evidentiary or procedural issues related to the hearing. 
(d)  The hearing shall be held before a quorum of the ethics board, presided over by the chair or designated counsel. At the hearing each party may be represented by counsel at their own expense, the parties may present evidence, call and examine witnesses and cross-examine witnesses of the other party. Witnesses shall be sworn by the person presiding over the hearing. Each party shall have the opportunity to argue their position to the board. 
(e)  The secretary of the ethics board or designee shall take notes of testimony and shall mark and preserve all exhibits. The proceedings shall be transcribed or videotaped. 
(f)  The hearing shall be noticed to be and conducted in closed session unless the accused officer requests, in writing, that it be open to the public. In all cases the ethics board may deliberate in closed session. 
(g)  The burden shall be on the complaining party to show to by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence a code violation occurred by the officer accused. 
(h)  If the accused fails to appear at the evidentiary hearing, the ethics board shall consider all allegations of the complaint to be true and shall determine what, if any sanctions are appropriate. 
(i)  At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the ethics board may require the parties to brief their positions, require supplementary arguments or take any other action deemed necessary to the board to create a complete record sufficient to make their decision. Upon completing deliberations, the ethics board shall, within 30 days of making their determination, submit a report to the council, including findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation as to what action, if any, the council should take with respect to the individual charged. The ethics board shall provide the complainant and the individual charged with a copy of the report in person or by certified mail. Either the complainant or the person charged may file an objection to the report and shall have the opportunity to present arguments supporting the objection to the council. 
(j)  Recommendations made to the common council that include disciplinary action must be approved by a super majority (majority plus one) of the entire ethics board. 
(5)  Council action. 
(a)  Review of ethics board report. Upon the receipt of the ethics board report the council shall take up the report at its next available, regular council meeting the council may adopt, reject, or modify the recommendation made by the ethics board. In making its decision the council may require additional oral or written argument from the parties. After such review and is deemed necessary by the council if the council, concludes that there is a violation of the code, the council may impose a sanction or penalty. 
(b)  Penalties and sanctions policy. It is the intent of the council to educate and, when necessary, discipline officials who violate the code. Discipline shall be progressive, from the least punitive to the most punitive measures, unless the council believes that the progressive discipline does not provide the appropriate sanction because of the gravity of the offense, or because the council does not believe the sanction would deter future misconduct. In all instances, the totality of the circumstances shall be taken into consideration in resolving the matter, including the intent of the one accused of wrongdoing. 
(c)  Possible penalties and sanctions. 
1.  An informal censure by the council, which would only be made as part of a motion in a public meeting. 
2.  A formal censure by the council, which would be made by motion in a public meeting and then published in the city newspaper. 
3.  Mandatory community service. [§ 62.11(3)(e), Wis. Stats.] 
4.  Attendance at counseling or mediation sessions. [§ 62.11(3)(e), Wis. Stats.] 
5.  Imposition of a dollar fine of up to $500.00. [§§ 62.11(3)(a) and (c), Wis. Stats.] 
6.  Any other sanction available by law. 
(d)  Penalties. The imposition of any of these penalties or sanctions will require an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the council, other than an informal or formal censure which shall only require a majority vote of the council. A violation of the penalties imposed by council may constitute grounds for removal from office under § 17.12(1)(a), Wis. Stats. 
(e)  Notice. The municipal clerk shall give notice of the council's decision to the person charged. 
(6)  Applicability. 
(a)  Incumbency. This code shall apply to officials currently in office. If an official is removed from office in any manner, including the loss of an election or voluntary resignation while a complaint issued under this chapter is pending, the board does not have jurisdiction to proceed and the complaint shall be dismissed. 
(b)  Employees. Complaints under the code shall be limited to elected or appointed city officials but [do] not include officials who are also employees. If employees violate the ethics code, they may be subject to disciplinary action, but not the procedures and sanctions of this chapter. Violation of this chapter are grounds for discipline up to and including termination. 
(7)  False or frivolous complaints. A person who knowingly makes a false, misleading, or unsubstantiated statement in a complaint is subject to criminal prosecution for perjury and possible civil liability. It is possible that after reviewing a complaint, it is determined that a sworn complaint is groundless and appears to have been filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or that intentionally false or malicious information has been provided under penalty of perjury. Instances of possible perjury will be referred to the district attorney after consultation with the city attorney. A city official who seeks to take civil action regarding any such complaint shall do so at his or her expense. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 2, 5-21-19) 
36.09 - Advisory opinions. 
(1)  Request for advisory opinion. Any individual, either personally or on behalf of an organization or governmental body, may, in writing, request the ethics board, to issue an advisory opinion regarding the propriety of any matter to which the person is or may become a party. It is prima facie evidence of intent to comply with the ethics code when a person requests an advisory opinion abides by the advisory opinion, if the material facts are as stated in the opinion request. The ethics board may authorize the city attorney to act in its stead in instances where delay is of substantial inconvenience or detriment to the requesting party. 
(2)  Confidentiality. Except as provided in subsection (3), neither the city attorney, a member of the ethics board, nor anyone else who becomes privy to the request or opinion may make public the identity of an individual requesting an advisory opinion or of individuals or organizations mentioned in the opinion. 
(3)  Exception to confidentiality. The ethics board or city attorney replying to a request for an advisory opinion may make the opinion public with the consent of the individual requesting the advisory opinion or the organization or governmental body on whose behalf it is requested and may make public a summary of an advisory opinion issued under this subsection after making sufficient alterations in the summary to prevent disclosing the identities of individuals involved in the opinion. A person who makes or purports to make public the substance of or any portion of an advisory opinion requested by or on behalf of the person waives the confidentiality of the request for an advisory opinion and of any records obtained or prepared by the ethics board or the city attorney for the local governmental unit in connection with the request for an advisory opinion. 
(Ord. No. 1360-0519, § 2, 5-21-19) 
36.10 - Distribution of the code. 
    The clerk shall provide copies of this section annually to elected and appointed officials, and shall keep at least one copy permanently on file for the use of the public. All employees shall receive a copy when they are hired.
