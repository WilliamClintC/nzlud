EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification.  Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number.  For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06.  The code and article numbers appear left of the
decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the article number being all digits left of the decimal.  The
section number appears right of the decimal.  As another example, 113.10
indicates the code number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article
within code 1), and the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections.  For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

with appropriations duly made, and unless the City Manager or designee first
certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance in such allotment or
appropriation and that sufficient funds therefrom are or will be available to
cover the claim or meet the obligation when it becomes due and payable. Any
authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the
provision of this Charter shall be void, and any payment so made illegal; such
action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or
made such payment or incurred such obligation, and the authorizing officer
shall also be liable to the City for any amount so paid. However, except where

current times. In the case of an area which is to be designated as an Historic
District, the district shall be a geographically definable area possessing a

structures or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical
development. When an Historic District has been established, the Commission

the district so that the County Assessor may take such factors into
consideration in assessing the properties.

of such properties and with the consent of the property owners, inspect such
properties from time to time and publish a register thereof from time to time
setting forth appropriate information concerning the registered buildings,
structures and sites;
      (3)    With the consent of the property owner, certify and mark with
appropriately designed markers, landmarks, buildings, structures and sites
which it has registered;

landmarks and buildings in designated historic districts and withdraw such
certification for failure to maintain the standards so prescribed. The

for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings.
      (5)    Acquire by purchase, gift, or lease and administer registered

street closest to the location which is intended to be identified by such
marker;

agencies of government who or which are conducting historical preservation
programs and coordinate the same insofar as possible; answer questions for

all sources for the accomplishment of the functions of the Commission;

negative impact on the setting or streetscape of the Historic District.
         B.   Changes in the Historic District which do not reinforce the
characteristics of the individual elements, sites, structures, streets, or
whole districts.
         C.   Any negative or adverse impact on the exterior appearance of the
site, structure, adjacent and surrounding buildings.
      (11)    Adopt rules and regulations concerning the operation of the
Commission, the functions and responsibilities of its officers, employees,
assistants and other personnel and such  other matters as may be necessary to
carry out the purposes of the article within compliance with the laws of the
City of Lewisburg and the State of West Virginia.
      (12)   Adopt such other rules and regulations as may be necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this article including the adoption of guidelines
for changes to landmarks and all buildings in designated historic districts,
but no such rules and regulations shall be inconsistent with any plan of the
Planning Commission of the Municipality. If there is a conflict between the
requirements of the zoning district and the requirements for landmarks and for
all buildings in the Historic District, the zoning district requirements apply.
The Commission may adopt and use the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. Any
guidelines for changes to landmarks and all property in the Historic District
shall be submitted to the City Council for its approval.
      (13)    Conduct educational programs including the preparation of
publications in order to inform the public about Lewisburg's historic landmarks
and Historic Districts and about ways to preserve these properties. Programs
and publications shall be developed with the help of interested
preservationists.
      (14)    Attend informational and educational programs covering the duties
of the Commission and current developments in historic preservation; and
      (15)    Develop for consideration by the City government incentives for
owners to maintain and rehabilitate their historic property. These incentives

appropriate for the building or structure. The Commission may work with private
groups who are interested in providing incentives for owners.

Article including the giving of notice of and the preparing for meetings, the
giving of notice to property owners and the public, and the circulating of
information about the Commission's decisions.

application to construct, alter, move,  demolish or repair any individual
landmark and any landmark, building, structure or site, or any sign thereon,
within the Historic District and to approve or reject such application, if any
such changes are visible or intended to be visible from an adjacent public way.
The Commission may request plans, plats, maps, elevations, specifications of
materials, colors and construction techniques, drawings, photographs and other
information as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the Commission to enable
it to make a determination on the application. The Commission shall hold a
public hearing upon each application for a certificate of appropriateness.
Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given by publication, in a
newspaper having general circulation in the City, at least seven days before
the hearing and by posting the notice on or near the main entrance of the hall
or room where the Commission usually meets. The Commission shall take such
action as required to inform the owners and tenants of any adjacent property
likely to be affected by the application and shall give the applicant and such
owners and tenants an opportunity to be heard. The applicant shall give notice
to adjacent property owners as directed by the Commission. Persons may give
testimony at the hearing on the application, and persons may submit their views
in writing prior to the public hearing.
      (1)    In reviewing an application and plan, the Commission shall give
consideration to:
         A.   The historical and architectural value or significance of the
landmark, building, structure, or site and its relation to the historic value
of the surrounding area.
         B.   The relationship of the exterior architectural features of a
designated structure to the rest of the structure and to the surrounding area.
         C.   The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement,
texture, color and materials proposed.
         D.   Signs shall be further regulated as provided in the Zoning

existing buildings in the Historic District.
         E.   Any new site element or landscape feature having impact on the
setting or streetscape of the Historic District.

and shall not consider interior arrangements; nor shall it disapprove
applications except in regard to the considerations set forth above. Exterior
features shall include such portion of the exterior of a building or structure
as is open to view from a public street, way or place. Architectural features
subject to review shall include the architectural character and general
composition of the exterior of a building or structure, including, but not
limited to, the kind, color and texture of the building material and the type,
design and character of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, other
appurtenant elements and natural features when they are integral to the
significance of the site.
      (3)    If the strict application of any provision of this article would
result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any
owner of any specific property, the Commission, in passing upon applications,
shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to
interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or
hardship: provided, that such variance, modification or interpretation shall
remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that
architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be
conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the Commission
may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will
in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this article.
      (4)    In the case of an application for repairs or alterations affecting
the exterior appearance of a structure which the Commission deems of value to
the City that the loss thereof will be a great loss to the City, State or
nation, the Commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an
economically feasible plan for the preservation of such structure.
      (5)    The review and approvals by the Commission shall extend to all the
properties in the Historic District in order to maintain the character of the
Historic District. It is not the intent of this article to limit new
construction, alteration or repairs to any one period of architectural style.
In reviewing plans for new construction, the Commission shall be aware that it
is important for the new building or structure to make a contribution to
maintaining or strengthening the character of the Historic District. The
Commission shall also be aware of importance of appropriate and compatible
design for new construction that fills a vacant lot on a block in the Historic
District.
      (6)    In their applications, the applicants shall present material about
alternatives to the plans they present, and this material shall include cost
figures obtained for the application. This material shall be submitted in order
to help the Commission in its evaluation of the plans of the applicant.
      (7)    Property owners and tenants are encouraged to have an early
consultation with the Commission during Commission meetings. Owners and tenants
are encouraged to discuss the outlines of their project before they start 
preparing their plans and purchasing materials. At its meeting, the Commission
will discuss with owners and tenants their plans and make suggestions about
their plans that will be prepared and submitted to the Commission. This
preliminary discussion is not a substitute for the review required under the
provisions of this article. Concerning signs for commercial property, the
Commission shall regularly remind owners and tenants of the value of an early
consultation so that their application will provide for a sign that is
appropriate for the Historic District.
      (8)    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a
designated historic property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a
material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, nor shall this
article prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not
prohibited by other laws, ordinances or regulations.
   (c)   (1)   The Commission shall approve the application and issue a
certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed action will be
appropriate. Unless the Commission is satisfied that proposed construction,
alteration or repair will not materially impair the historical or architectural
value or significance of a landmark, or a building, structure or site, situate
within the Historic District, the Commission shall reject the application and
deny the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. If the applicant wants
to make a change in the approval given, the applicant must return to the
Commission and submit the proposed change for approval under the Commission's
procedures. The Commission shall adopt procedures to make certain that
applicants confirm that they understand what has been approved by the
Commission.
      (2)   If an applicant asks for relief because of economic hardship
involving the proposed alteration, repair or new construction, the applicant
shall submit an affidavit providing information about the property, its annual
expenses and the cost of the proposed work. The applicant shall also submit an
affidavit from the person who will do the proposed work providing information
on the cost of the work and the cost of recent similar work that has been
completed. The applicant may ask that financial information given to the
Commission be kept private. The Commission shall study the question of economic
hardship for the applicant, and it may ask the applicant for additional
material including information on alternatives to the proposed plans. The
Commission shall determine whether the property can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the application. If economic hardship is
not proved, the Commission shall turn down the request for relief and shall
deny the application. If the Commission finds economic hardship, it shall
approve the application.
      (3)    In the case of an application to demolish a building or structure,
the applicant shall provide information about the present use of the property,
its annual expenses, its present condition, the cost of any repairs that are
needed and any offers to sell or to buy the property. The applicant shall
present this information through an affidavit and shall also submit an
affidavit about the cost of repairs and the condition of the building or
structure from a person who has rehabilitated three or more buildings. The
applicant may ask that financial information given to the Commission be kept
private. The applicant shall also provide information on the plans for the
property if permission is granted to demolish the building. These plans shall
include financial information and a timetable for completion of the work. If
the Commission finds that these plans are not feasible and that the lot on
which the designated property is located will become a vacant lot, the
Commission may reject the demolition application.
      (4)    The Commission may approve an application to demolish a building
or structure in an Historic District if it finds that the building or structure
does not contribute to the Historic District. On all other demolition
applications, the Commission shall reach a decision based on the other criteria
of this section. The Commission shall endeavor to work out with the applicant
an economically feasible plan for the preservation of the building or
structure.
      (5)    If the applicant asks for relief because of economic hardship
involving the proposed demolition, the Commission shall study the question of
economic hardship for the applicant, and it may ask the applicant for
additional material including information on alternative uses for the building
or structure. The Commission shall determine whether the property can be put to
reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the application. If economic
hardship is not proved, the Commission shall turn down the request for relief
and shall deny the application. If the Commission finds economic hardship, it
shall approve the application. The regulations on proposed demolitions shall
apply to a property owner's request to demolish part of a designated building
or structure.
      (6)    All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness
shall conform to the provisions of such certificate. After the approval has
been given, the Commission may assign one of its members to work with and help
the applicant. While the work is under way, the Commission, helped by the City
staff, shall stay informed about the work being performed in order to ensure
compliance with the certificate. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the
cost to the applicant of redoing work. If work is being performed that is not
in compliance with such certificate, the City shall take the necessary action
to obtain compliance. At its regular meetings the Commission may schedule a
report on the status of the approvals it has given, including the work under
way.
      (7)   When the approved work has been completed, the applicant shall
notify the City, and the Commission shall ask the zoning officer to inspect the
property in order to determine that the work complies with the approval given
by the Commission. Where there has not been compliance, the Commission and the
City shall take further action as needed. Failure to comply with the approval
given by the Commission shall constitute a violation of this article.
      (8)    In the event the Commission rejects an application, it shall place
upon its records and shall transmit a record of this action and reasons
therefore, in writing, to the applicant. In this written record, the Commission
may make recommendations relative to design, arrangement, texture, material and
similar features. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to
the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
      (9)    During the meeting at which the applicant's plans are being
considered, he may ask that his application be tabled because he wishes to make
the modifications being suggested by the Commission. The Commission may then
table the application. Where appropriate, the Commission may approve an
application with the requirement that the applicant submit revised plans
showing the modifications that the Commission has suggested.
      (10)    Applicants or their representative shall attend the meeting at
which their application will be considered in order to answer questions that
members of the Commission ask. The Commission has a need to clarify issues
before it approves or rejects an application. The Commission may table an
application until the applicant or a representative attends a Commission
meeting. The Commission may reject an application at the end of the 45 day
period if the applicant or a representative has not attended a Commission
meeting.
   (d)   The Commission shall file with the Zoning Officer its certificate of
appropriateness or rejection of all applications submitted to it for review.
      (1)    No work shall begin until such certificate shall have been filed.
      (2)    In the case of rejection, such certificate shall be binding on the
Zoning Officer and no building permit shall be issued.
   (e)   Where there is any violation of this article the Commission, or the
Zoning Officer shall, through the City Attorney, institute appropriate action
to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such violation. The violation of this
article shall include starting or completing work on a designated property
without the approval of the Commission where such approval is required.
   (f)   The Commission shall cooperate with and coordinate its activities with
the West Virginia Department of Archives and History, the West Virginia
Historical Society, Greenbrier County Historical Society, and the West Virginia
Antiquities Commission, with the view of developing a unified program for the
identification, study, preservation and protection of all historic buildings,
structures and sites in the Municipality.
   (g)   The Commission shall submit a brief annual report of its activities to
the City Planning Commission, to Council and to the West Virginia Department of
Archives and History. The report shall provide a list of decisions of the
Commission during the year and a list of designated properties threatened by
demolition. The Commission may ask the City staff for assistance in determining
the buildings threatened by demolition and in preparing the report.
141.04  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Any person, individual, firm or corporation proposing to construct,
alter, move, demolish, or repair any landmark, or any building, structure or
site within the Historic District and such changes are visible or intended to
be visible from an adjacent publicway, shall file an application for the same
with the Zoning Officer along with all maps, plats, plans and all other data
concerning such construction. The City shall promptly notify the chair or
secretary of the commission when an application is received. Each application
shall include the following:
      (1)    Scaled elevation and/or suitable photographs of the buildings
facades which are visible from a public way. The applicant shall also submit
suitable photographs of the streetscape showing adjacent buildings including
buildings across the street.
      (2)    Specification of materials, colors, and construction techniques.
      (3)    Other data as required by the rules of the Commission.
   (b)   A Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission is mandatory
before the following may be undertaken on a landmark or within the Historic
District: construction, moving, demolition, repair or alteration of any
landmark, building, structure or site in any manner affecting the exterior
appearance of such landmark, building, structure or site, if such changes are
visible from an adjacent public way. It shall be the responsibility of property
owners or tenants to submit an application to the Commission when one part of
their plans involves the exterior of the building. This requirement applies to
a situation in which the owner or tenant originally received a permit for work
that did not require review by the Commission.
   (c)   A Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission shall
automatically expire, unless extended by the Commission, if:
      (1)    In the case of an application for repairs or alterations to a
structure and an application for the demolition or moving of a structure, the
work has not commenced within six months or has not been completed within 18
months from the date of issuance of the Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (2)    In the case of an application for the construction of a new
structure, the work has not commenced within six months from the date of the
Certificate of Appropriateness or is not completed within three years.
   The Commission may ask the City staff for assistance in mailings to
applicants reminding them of the deadline for completion of their approved
work.
   (d)   (1)   Failure of the Commission to act within forty-five days from the
date the application is filed shall constitute approval unless an extension is
agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the Commission. If an extension is
not agreed to and the Commission needs more time to deal with the issues
presented by the application, the Commission may reject the application at the
end of the forty-five day period and at the same time schedule a further
discussion of the application at its next meeting in order to find a
satisfactory solution. This additional time will enable the Commission to carry
out its responsibility to protect Lewisburg's historic buildings.
      (2)    Where appropriate, the members of the Commission may be polled by
telephone in order to act on an application that is pending before the
Commission.
   (e)   There shall be no monetary charge imposed on the applicant by virtue
of this article.
141.05  MAINTENANCE; DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT; EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Every person in charge of a designated historic property shall keep in
good repair: all of the exterior portions of the building or structure; and all
interior portions thereof which,  if not so maintained, may cause it to
deteriorate or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
The purpose of this provision is to prevent a person from forcing the
demolition of a building or structure by neglecting it and by permitting damage
to it because of weather or vandalism. A person shall meet the requirements of
this paragraph by complying with the building regulations of the City. No
provision of this article shall be interpreted to require an owner or tenant to
undertake an alteration or to restore a building or structure to its original
appearance.
   (b)   The Commission shall prepare and maintain a list of designated
properties that are not being maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. The
City staff shall help in the preparation and maintenance of this list which
will be based on the City's rules and regulations. The Commission may ask the
Zoning Officer to inspect a building so that it will have current information
on the property. When necessary for reasons of health or safety, the Zoning
Officer may seek access to the interior of a landmark or a building or
structure in the Historic District in accordance with the instructions of the
City Attorney. The Commission shall regularly review its list of deteriorating
properties and may request a meeting with the owner or tenant when the property
is in poor repair. The Commission shall discuss with the owner or tenant ways
to improve the condition of the property. The Commission shall discuss with
City staff the condition of the property and steps to remedy the existing
condition. The steps may include the taking of legal action against the owner
or tenant.
   (c)   In any case where the City determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health or property that affect a designated
property, the City shall order the remedying of these conditions without the
approval of the Commission. The City staff shall promptly notify the chair of
the Commission of the action being taken.
141.06  BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the historic district shall be delineated upon a map
described as "Lewisburg Historic District No. 1."and herein incorporated into
this article by reference.

Commission shall submit its report, including maps and photographs as
necessary, to the West Virginia Department of Archives and History. In the case
of a report for a proposed Historic District, the Commission shall submit with
the report a map showing the boundaries of the proposed district. The
Department of Archives and History may prepare written comments within forty-
five days on the report.
   (b)    Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed designation of
the historic property or Historic District and any proposed regulations and
requirements for the historic property or district. Notice of the hearing shall
be published at least two times in the principal newspaper of general
circulation in the City. Written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by
certified mail with signed return receipt required by the Commission to all
owners and occupants of such properties. All the notices shall be published or
mailed not less than ten or more than twenty days prior to the date set for the
public hearing.
   (c)    Unless the owner of a proposed individual landmark building or fifty
percent (50%) of the ownership interest in a proposed district objects to such
designation or regulations and requirements within thirty days following the
public hearing, Council may designate the property or properties as historic,
and approve, amend or reject the proposed regulations or requirements.
   (d)    Within thirty days following such designation or approval, the owners
and occupants of each designated historic property shall be given written
notification of the designation and approval by Council, which notice shall
apprise the owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of
appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in the exterior
appearance of the historic landmark or of the property in the Historic
District.
   (e)    Any historic landmark or district designated by the City shall be
shown on the official zoning map of the City in order to provide notice of the
designation in addition to other notification requirements of this article.
   (f)    The steps in this section shall apply to any proposed enlargement of
a Historic District, and the report and public hearing requirements shall apply
to the removal of a designation or to the reduction in size of a Historic
District.
141.08  VIOLATIONS.
   Any person, firm or corporation, or agent of such, found guilty of
constructing, altering, moving, demolishing, or repairing any landmark, or any
building, structure or site within the Historic District where such changes are
visible from a public way without having secured the approval of the Commission
as required by this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
subject to a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) and costs, and every
day any such violation shall continue to exist shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder.
141.09  NOTICE.
   (a)    The Commission shall arrange for notice in the County land records of
the designation of landmarks and the individual properties in the Historic
District. The City staff shall help the Commission in providing this notice to
the public.
   (b)    Prior to the sale or transfer of a designated landmark or a property
in an Historic District, the owner shall give written notice to the person
acquiring the landmark or the property that it has been designated as historic
and is subject to the provisions of this article. The current owner shall give
written notice to the Commission that this notification has been given. Failure
of the owner to give the required notice shall constitute a violation of this
Article.

   Any person or persons, firm or corporation, aggrieved by a decision of the
Commission shall have the right of appeal concerning such decision to the
Greenbrier Circuit Court.

(Ord. 279.  Passed 4-6-19.)
171.05  APPEALS.
   Any person sentenced to imprisonment, or any individual or corporation

right of appeal from such judgment of the Municipal Judge to the court having
jurisdiction over appeals there from, upon the payment of costs and the
execution of an appeal bond, with security deemed sufficient by the Municipal
Judge, in a penalty of an amount deemed sufficient by the Municipal Judge, and
costs, conditioned that the appellant will appear before the appellate court on
the first day of the next term thereof to answer to the offense with which he

accordance with law.  (Ord. 279.  Passed 4-6-19.)

the following acts:
      (1)   Contemptuous or insolent behavior towards him while he is engaged
in the trial of a case or in any other judicial proceeding.
      (2)   Any breach of the peace, willful disturbance or indecent conduct in
the presence of such judge while so engaged, or so near regarding obstruct or
interrupt his proceedings.
      (3)   Violence or threats of violence to such judge or any officer,
juror, witness or party going to, attending or returning from, any judicial
proceeding before such judge in respect to anything done or to be done in the
course of such proceeding.
      (4)   Misbehavior of any officer in his official character in respect to
any action or judicial proceeding had or pending before such judge or any
process, judgment, order or notice therein.
      (5)   Willful resistance, in the presence of the judge by an officer,
juror, witness, party or other person to any lawful process or order of such
judge.
   (b)   An order of arrest may be issued by the Municipal Judge on which any
person guilty of contempt may be taken and brought before him, or such person
may be taken in custody by any officer or person present, upon the oral order
of the Judge, and held to answer for the contempt.  An opportunity must be
given him to be heard in defense or explanation of his conduct; and the judge
may thereupon discharge him, or adjudge him guilty of the contempt, and punish
him by fine or imprisonment, or both.  The fine shall not exceed fifty dollars
($50.00) or imprisonment for five days.
   (c)   The conviction for contempt, specifying the particular circumstances
of the offense and judgment thereon, shall be entered by the Municipal Judge in
his docket.  A warrant of commitment for the term of imprisonment adjudged may
be issued by the Judge, commanding an officer to take the offender to the jail
of the county, and the jailer to imprison him therein for the adjudged term;
and such warrant shall contain a transcript of the entry in the docket.  The
judgment may include, in addition to the fine, all costs in the case, including
costs of arresting and keeping in prison the offender.
(Ord. 279.  Passed 4-6-19.)
171.07  BAIL BONDS AND CASH DEPOSITS.
   (a)   Except as may be provided otherwise in any case by State Law, this
Code or other Ordinances, whenever any person is arrested for any violation of
an ordinance of the City or for any offense of which the municipal judge has
jurisdiction, it shall be lawful for the Municipal Judge, Recorder, Mayor,
Chief of Police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police
headquarters to admit such person to bail upon the execution of a bond to the
City in such an amount, not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than the
maximum fine which may be adjudged against such person for the offense or
offenses he is alleged to have committed plus the costs which could be assessed
against him, as in the discretion of the officer will secure the prisoner's
presence, conditioned that the accused will appear upon a day named, before the
municipal judge of the City, to await trial; and every such bond taken shall be
filed as soon as practicable with the Municipal Court by the officer approving
and taking such bond; and the Municipal Judge, Recorder, Mayor, Chief of Police
and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police headquarters shall each
have the power to approve any bond taken under the provisions of this section,
precedence being given to the ranking officer present when such bond is
presented.  No person shall be accepted as surety upon any penal bond unless he
shall acknowledge the bond before some official duly authorized by this Code or
by State Law to administer an oath, and shall make oath that he is the owner in
fee of real estate situate in Greenbrier County and worth the amount of the
bond over and above his debts and liabilities; but the officers hereinbefore
named in this section are hereby authorized and empowered to accept a deposit
in cash of an amount, not less than the  minimum nor more than the maximum
hereinbefore specified for a bond, which, in the judgment of the officer
accepting the deposit, will be sufficient to cause the prisoner's appearance
upon the day required of him before the Municipal Judge to await trial upon the
charge against him.  In the event any person so released upon bond or such
deposit shall fail to appear before the Municipal Judge for trial at the
appointing time, or, having appeared, shall leave the court without awaiting
trial, his bond shall be forfeited thereby to the City, and if a cash deposit
has been made to secure his release, the sum so deposited shall be delivered to
the Municipal Judge and by him promptly turned into the City treasury to the
credit of the general fund and accounted for by him in the same manner that
fines collected by him are counted for; and in the event of the forfeiture of a
penal bond, the Treasurer shall forthwith take the steps necessary at law for
the collection thereof.
   (b)   No cash bond shall be accepted by any officer authorized to accept
such bond unless the prisoner and the officer authorized to accept it are
present at police headquarters.  The money deposited as security for any
person's appearance shall be deposited with the desk sergeant at police
headquarters, to be by him safely kept until the next regular session of the
Municipal Court, when it shall be turned over by the desk sergeant who received
it to the judge of the Municipal Court, and by the Judge disposed of as
required by the bond and this and the preceding section.
   (c)   If any officer shall accept or approve any cash bond at any place or
in any other manner than is provided for and authorized by this article, such
unauthorized acceptance or approval shall constitute good cause for his
suspension or removal or the reprimand or fining of such officer after a
hearing on the charge by the City Council.  In case of the arrest of any person
upon a charge of a felony, the bond for his release, if approved, shall only be
approved by the Municipal Judge, or the Judge of a court having jurisdiction to
try the prisoner for the felony alleged to have been committed by him.
   (d)   No practicing attorney, officer of the Municipal Court or member of
the Police Department shall be accepted as surety on any bond provided for in
this article.
(Ord. 279.  Passed 4-6-19.)
171.08   FINES AND COSTS WHEN DEFENDANTS UNABLE TO PAY.
   (a)   Whenever a person is convicted in the Municipal Court of a violation
of this Code or other ordinance or any rule, regulation, notice or order
promulgated pursuant to authority thereof, and such person is sentenced to pay
a fine, and it shall appear to the court on its own motion or on motion of the
defendant that such defendant is unable to pay such fine forthwith, the court
may order the defendant to pay such fine and any costs which the defendant may
be required to pay in installments or upon such other terms and conditions or
within such period of time as may enable the defendant to pay such fine and
costs.
   (b)   In determining whether a defendant is unable to pay a fine forthwith,
the court may require such defendant to file a petition, under oath with the
court, upon a form provided by the court, setting forth the financial condition
of the defendant.
   (c)   Such form shall be a questionnaire, and shall include, but shall not
be limited to: The name and residence of the defendant; his occupation, if any;
his family status and the number of persons dependent upon him; his monthly
income; whether or not his dependents are employed and, if so, their
approximate monthly income; his banking accounts, if any; real estate owned by
the defendant, or any interest he may have in real estate; income produced
there from; any independent income accruing to the defendant; tangible and
intangible personal property owned by the defendant, or in which he may have an
interest; and a Statement listing the approximate indebtedness of the defendant
to other persons.  Such form shall also include a payment plan of the
defendant, if the court should exercise its discretion in permitting the
payment of such fine and costs in installments or other conditions to be fixed
by the court.  At the end of such form there shall be printed in boldface type,
in a distinctive color the following: "THIS STATEMENT IS MADE UNDER OATH.  ANY
FALSE STATEMENT OF A MATERIAL FACT TO ANY QUESTION CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL
CONSTITUTE FALSE SWEARING AND SHALL BE AN OFFENSE AGAINST THIS SECTION.  THE
MAXIMUM PENALTY IS $100 FINE OR THIRTY DAYS IN JAIL, OR BOTH." A copy of the
petition shall be retained by the defendant.
   (d)   If the defendant is unable to read or write, the court or the clerk
may assist the defendant in completing the petition and require him to affix
his mark thereto.  The consequences of the making of a false Statement shall be
explained to such defendant.
   (e)   If a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine and payment of the fine or
fine and costs is ordered to be made on an installment basis or on other
conditions under the provisions of section 11-17, and if the defendant is also
placed on probation or imposition of the execution of sentence is suspended,
the court may make payment of the fine a condition of probation or suspension
of sentence.
   (f)   If a defendant is permitted to pay a fine or fine and costs on an
installment basis or under such other conditions as the court shall fix under
the provisions of section 11-17, the court may require as a condition that the
defendant be of peace and good behavior until the fine and costs are paid.
   (g)   When any person sentenced to pay a fine defaults in the payment of any
such fine or of any installment thereof, the court may issue a summons for such
person to appear before the court for a hearing on the question of whether such
person's failure to pay the fine or any installment was attributable to
intentional refusal to comply with the prior order of the court or to a lack of
a good faith effort to comply therewith.  The court may, after hearing, order
that the person in default be allowed additional time for payment, may reduce
or remit the amount of the fine or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in
part, or upon a finding that the default was intentional or due to the lack of
a good faith effort to comply with the prior order of the court, may order such
person confined for such period up to thirty days as the court in its
discretion shall determine.
(Ord. 279.  Passed 4-6-19.)
171.09  COURT COSTS.
   (a)   Administrative Fee Per Summons.  A Municipal Court Fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) is hereby established to be assessed on each summons, upon
conviction.
(Ord. 183.  Passed 11-21-06.)
   (b)   Fee For Failure to Appear.  A Failure to Appear Fee of twenty dollars
($20.00) will be charged to all persons who do not appear as directed by a
summons or citation; unless prior arrangements are made with, and approved by
the Court.  This fee will be charged regardless of the final outcome of the
Court proceeding and will be charged each time that a failure to appear occurs.
   (c)   Daily Charge for Jail Time.  Persons serving jail time will have the
cost of jail fees and associated transportation added to any and all fines
associated with their conviction(s).

be drawn by such commissioners; and it shall be the duty of the Clerk of the
Court to place the list thereof in the hands of the Chief of Police or other
officer authorized to summon them.  It shall be the duty of such officer, at

person commanding him to attend as a juror at a time and place designated
therein, which copy shall be registered or certified and deposited in the post
office, addressed to such person at his usual post office address.  The
personal receipt of the person so addressed for such registered or certified
copy shall be regarded as personal service of such writ or summons upon such
person.

the box for the ballots, marked "drawn", except such as contain the names of
those who, for the reasons aforesaid, are unable to attend, the last mentioned
box shall be opened in the presence of the officers attending to draw jurors,
and the ballots therein replaced in the jury box, from which drafts shall

provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT  STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk.  Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait.  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06  UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07  ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof. 
(WVaC 17C-3-9)

to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second

      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),
(e) or (f) of this section or under a prior enactment of this section for an
offense which occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the
date of arrest in the current proceeding;
      (2)   Any conviction under a municipal ordinance of this State or any
other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state of an

ten-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) for violation of subsection (c) of this section, which
violation occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant or indictment or information for
a second or subsequent offense under this section if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous
offense has become final, or the person has previously had a period of
conditional probation imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b).
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection  (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   For purposes of this section, the term “controlled substance” has the
meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Chapter 60A.
   (o)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation: 
provided, that the court may apply the provisions  of West Virginia Code 62-11A
to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first
offense under this section:  provided however, that the court may impose a term
of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) to persons
adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court pursuant to
the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B may be used as an alternative
sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section for a first or
subsequent offense:  provided, however, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of second offense under this
section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than five days of
the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave
home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code
62-11B-5:  provided, however, that for any period of home incarceration ordered
for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation  of this section,
electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten days of the total
period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for
those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (p)   As used in subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this
section, the words “drives a vehicle in this Municipality” do not mean or
include driving or operating a vehicle solely and exclusively on one’s own
property.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (q)   For purposes of this section, the phrase "in this Municipality" means
anywhere within the physical boundaries of this Municipality, including, but
not limited to, publicly maintained streets and highways, and subdivision
streets or other areas not publicly maintained but nonetheless open to the use
of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.
   (r)   When used in this section, the terms or phrases "driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor," "driving or operating a motor vehicle while
intoxicated," "for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor
to drive any vehicle," or any similar term or phrase shall be construed to mean
and be synonymous with the term or phrase "while under the influence of
alcohol...drives a vehicle" as the latter term or phrase is used in this
section.
   (s)   A warrant or indictment which charges or alleges an offense,
prohibited by the provisions of this section, and which warrant or indictment
uses any of the terms or phrases set forth in subsection (r) hereof, shall not
thereby be fatally defective if such warrant or indictment otherwise informs
the person so accused of the charges against him.  (WVaC 17C-5-2a)
333.011 DEFINITION OF PHRASE “IN THIS CITY”; PHRASES SYNONYMOUS WITH DRIVING

   (a)   For purposes of this article and Section
333.01, the phrase “in this City” shall mean anywhere within the physical
boundaries of this City, including, but not limited to, publicly maintained

drives a vehicle as the latter term or phrase is used in Section
333.01.
   (c)   From and after July 21, 2009 a warrant or indictment which charges or
alleges an offense, prohibited by the provisions of Section
333.01, and which warrant or indictment uses any of the terms or phrases set
forth in subsection (b) hereof, shall not thereby be fatally defective if such

333.012 DEFERRAL OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR CERTAIN FIRST OFFENSES UPON
CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsections (g) hereof, whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under this article or under
any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving under the
influence alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)    Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)    Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under Section
333.01(c)(2), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the
consent of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding
any provisions of this code to the contrary,  place him or her on probation,
which conditions shall include, that he or she  successfully completes the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in Section Three-a,
Article Five-a of the WV State Code. Participation therein shall be for a
period of at least one hundred and sixty five days after he or she has served
the fifteen days of license suspension imposed pursuant to Section Two, Article
Five-a of the WV State Code.
   (b)   A defendant's election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in Section Two, Article Five-a, of the WV State Code.
   (c)    (1)    If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to 
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)    A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof  must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant's right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol  Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within 30 days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant's attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the 30-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss
the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with regard to
the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in subsection
(c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of this article,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime except for those provided in article
five-a of this chapter.  Except as provided in Section
333.01(j)(k) and (l) regarding  subsequent offenses, the effect of the
dismissal and discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law
to the status he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to
whom a dismissal and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to
be guilty of perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by
reason of his or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or
trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than
any inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as that term is
defined in Section
333.01(l).
   (f)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (g)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)    In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision
of this article has been charged;
      (2)    if the person holds a commercial driver's license or operates
commercial  motor vehicle(s), or

under Section
333.01 or under any statute of the United States or of any state  relating to
driving under the influence alcohol, any controlled substance or any other
drug.
   (h)   (1)    After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to

person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial,
and conviction,  pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within 30 days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant's attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections,  affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted  for a violation of Section
333.01(c) whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any court costs assessable against a person convicted of a
violation of Section
333.01(i). Payment of such costs may be made a condition of probation. The

not, shall be distributed as other court costs in accordance with Section Two,

Section Four, Article Twenty-Nine, Chapter Thirty and Sections Two, Seven and
Ten, Article Five, Chapter Sixty-Two of the WV State Code.

333.03  IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Any person who drives a motor vehicle in this State is deemed to have
given his or her consent by the operation of the motor vehicle to a preliminary
breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of either his or her blood,
breath or urine for the purposes of determining the alcoholic content of his or
her blood.
   (b)    A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in accordance with
the provisions  of section five of this article whenever a law-enforcement
officer has reasonable cause to believe a person has committed an offense
prohibited by Section
333.01 or by an ordinance of a municipality of this State which has the same
elements as an offense described in Section
333.01.
   (c)    A secondary test of blood, breath or urine is incidental to a lawful
arrest and is to be administered at the direction of the arresting law-
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has
committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01 or by an ordinance of a municipality of this State which has the same
elements as an offense described in Section
333.01.
   (d)    The law-enforcement agency that employs the law-enforcement officer
shall designate which type of secondary test is to be administered: provided,
that if the test designated is a blood test and the person arrested refuses to
submit to the blood test, then the law-enforcement officer making the arrest
shall designate either a breath or urine test to be administered.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
333.06, the refusal to submit to a blood test only may not result in the
revocation of the arrested person's license to operate a motor vehicle in this
state.
   (e)    Any person to whom a preliminary breath test is administered who is
then arrested shall be given a written statement advising him or her that his
or her refusal to submit to the secondary chemical test pursuant to subsection
(d) hereof, will result in the revocation of his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle in this State for a period of at least one year and up to life.
   (f)    Any law-enforcement officer who has been properly trained in the
administration of any secondary chemical test authorized by this article,
including, but not limited to, certification by the division of health in the
operation of any equipment required for the collection and analysis of a breath
sample, may conduct the test at any location in the county wherein the arrest
is made: Provided, That the law-enforcement officer may conduct the test at the
nearest available properly functioning secondary chemical testing device
located outside the county in which the arrest was made, if (1) there is no
properly functioning secondary chemical testing device located within the
county the arrest was made or (2) there is no magistrate available within the
county the arrest was made for the arraignment of the person arrested. A law-
enforcement officer who is directing that a secondary chemical test be
conducted has the authority to transport the person arrested to where the
secondary chemical testing device is located.
   (g)    If the arresting officer lacks proper training in the administration
of a secondary chemical test, then any other law-enforcement officer who has
received training in the administration of the secondary chemical test to be
administered may, upon the request of the arresting law-enforcement officer and
in his or her presence, conduct the secondary test. The results of a test
conducted pursuant to this subsection may be used in evidence to the same
extent and in the same manner as if the test had been conducted by the
arresting law-enforcement officer.
   (h)    Only the person actually administering or conducting a test conducted
pursuant to this article is competent to testify as to the results and the
veracity of the test.

person has committed an offense prohibited by Section Eighteen, Article Seven,
Chapter Twenty of the West Virginia Code, relating to the operation of a
motorboat, jet ski or other motorized vessel, shall follow the provisions of
this section in administering, or causing to be administered, a preliminary
breath analysis and the secondary chemical test of the accused person's blood,
breath or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol content of his or her
blood.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.04  PRELIMINARY BREATH ANALYSIS.
   When a law-enforcement officer of this City has reason to believe a person
has committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01, the law-enforcement officer may require such person to submit to a
preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of determining such person's blood
alcohol content. Such breath analysis must be administered as soon as possible
after the law-enforcement officer has a reasonable belief that the person has
been driving while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or
drugs. Any preliminary breath analysis required under this section must be
administered with a device and in a manner approved by the Department of Health
for that purpose. The results of a preliminary breath analysis shall be used

direction of the arresting law-enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof.  These limitations shall
not apply, to the taking of a breath test or a urine specimen. In withdrawing
blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof, only a
previously unused and sterile needle and sterile vessel may be utilized and the
withdrawal shall otherwise be in strict accord with accepted medical
practices.  A nonalcoholic antiseptic shall be used for cleansing the skin
prior to venipuncture. The person tested may, at his own expense, have a doctor
of medicine or osteopathy, or registered nurse, or trained medical technician
at the place of his employment, of his own choosing, administer a chemical test
in addition to the test administered at the direction of the  law-enforcement
officer.  Upon the request of the person who is tested, full information
concerning the test taken at the direction of the  law-enforcement officer
shall be made available to him or her.  No person who administers any such test
upon the request of a law-enforcement officer as herein defined, no hospital in
or with which such person is employed or is otherwise associated or in which
such test is administered, and no other person, firm or corporation by whom or
with which such person is employed or is in any way associated, shall be in
anywise criminally liable for the administration of such test, or civilly
liable in damages to the person tested unless for gross negligence or willful
or wanton injury.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.06  REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTS.
   (a)   If any person under arrest as specified in Section
333.03 refuses to submit to any secondary chemical test, the tests shall not be
given: provided, that prior to the refusal, the person is given an oral warning
and a written statement advising him or her that his or her refusal to submit
to the secondary test finally designated will result in the revocation of his
or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for a period of at
least forty-five days and up to life; and that after fifteen minutes following
the warnings the refusal is considered final. The arresting officer after that
period of time expires has no further duty to provide the person with an
opportunity to take the secondary test. The officer shall, within forty-eight
hours of the refusal, sign and submit to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles a
written statement of the officer that:
      (1)   He or she had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been
driving a motor vehicle in this State while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (2)   The person was lawfully placed under arrest for an offense relating
to driving a motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (3)   The person refused to submit to the secondary chemical test finally
designated in the manner provided in Section
333.03; and
      (4)   The person was given a written statement advising him or her that
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this state would be revoked
for a period of at least forty-five days and up to life if he or she refused to
submit to the secondary test finally designated in the manner provided in
Section
333.03. The signing of the statement required to be signed by this section
constitutes an oath or affirmation by the person signing the statement that the
statements contained in the statement are true and that any copy filed is a
true copy. The statement shall contain upon its face a warning to the officer
signing that to willfully sign a statement containing false information
concerning any matter or thing, material or not material, is false swearing and
is a misdemeanor. Upon receiving the statement the commissioner shall make and
enter an order revoking the person's license to operate a motor vehicle in this
state for the period prescribed by this section.
   For the first refusal to submit to the designated secondary chemical test,
the commissioner shall make and enter an order revoking the person's license to
operate a motor vehicle in this state for a period of one year or forty-five
days, with an additional one year of participation in the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program in accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code
17C-5A-3a; provided, that a person revoked for driving while under the
influence of drugs is not eligible to participate in the Motor Vehicle Test and
Lock Program. The application for participation in the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program shall be considered to be a waiver of the hearing
provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. If the commissioner has previously
revoked the person's license under the provisions of this section, the
commissioner shall, for the refusal to submit to the designated secondary
chemical test, make and enter an order revoking the person's license to operate
a motor vehicle in this state for a period of ten years: provided, however,
that the license may be reissued in five years in accordance with the
provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. If the commissioner has previously
revoked the person's license more than once under the provisions of this
section, the commissioner shall, for the refusal to submit to the designated
secondary chemical test, make and enter an order revoking the person's license
to operate a motor vehicle in this state for a period of life. A copy of each
order shall be forwarded to the person by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, and shall contain the reasons for the revocation and shall
specify the revocation period imposed pursuant to this section. A revocation
shall not become effective until ten days after receipt of the copy of the
order. Any person who is unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering him or her incapable of refusal shall be considered not to have
withdrawn his or her consent for a test of his or her blood, breath or urine as
provided in section four of this article and the test may be administered
although the person is not informed that his or her failure to submit to the
test will result in the revocation of his or her license to operate a motor
vehicle in this state for the period provided for in this section. A revocation
under this section shall run concurrently with the period of any suspension or
revocation imposed in accordance with other provisions of this code and growing
out of the same incident which gave rise to the arrest for driving a motor
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs
and the subsequent refusal to undergo the test finally designated in accordance
with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-4.
   (b)    For the purposes of this section, where reference is made to previous
suspensions or revocations under this section, the following types of
suspensions or revocations shall also be regarded as suspensions or revocations
under this section:
      (1)   Any suspension or revocation on the basis of a conviction under a
municipal ordinance of another state or a statute of the United States or of
any other state of an offense which has the same elements as an offense
described in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2 for conduct which occurred on or after
the tenth day of June, one thousand nine hundred eighty-three; and
      (2)   Any revocation under the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C- 5A 1
or 2 for conduct which occurred on or after the tenth day of June, one thousand
nine hundred eighty-three.
   (c)    A person whose license to operate a motor vehicle in this state has
been revoked shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with
the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C 5A 2.

   (a)    Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this state
while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, or upon
the trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have
been committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol
in the person's blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as
shown by a chemical analysis of his or her blood, breath or urine, is
admissible, if the sample or specimen was taken within two hours from and after
the time of arrest or of the acts alleged. The evidence gives rise to the
following presumptions or has the following effect:
      (1)   Evidence that there was, at that time, five hundredths of one
percent or less, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, is prima facie
evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
      (2)   Evidence that there was, at that time, more than five hundredths of
one percent and less than eight hundredths of one percent, by weight, of
alcohol in the person's blood is relevant evidence, but it is not to be given
prima facie effect in indicating whether the person was under the influence of
alcohol;
      (3)   Evidence that there was, at that time, eight hundredths of one
percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be admitted
as prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
   (b)    A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood
shall be based upon a formula of:
      (1)   The number of grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of
blood;
      (2)   The number of grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath;
      (3)   The number of grams of alcohol per sixty-seven milliliters of
urine; or
      (4)   The number of grams of alcohol per eighty-six milliliters of serum.
   (c)    A chemical analysis of a person's blood, breath or urine, in order to
give rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in subsection
(a) hereof, must be performed in accordance with methods and standards approved
by the state division of health. A chemical analysis of blood or urine to
determine the alcohol content of blood shall be conducted by a qualified
laboratory or by the state police scientific laboratory of the criminal
identification bureau of the West Virginia state police.
   (d)    The provisions of this article do not limit the introduction in any
administrative or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.08  RIGHT TO DEMAND TEST.

controlled substances or drugs and who is not tested at the direction of the
arresting officer under the provisions of Section
333.03 et seq., or who is lawfully arrested as aforesaid by any other police
law-enforcement officer, shall have the right to demand that a sample or
specimen of his blood, breath or urine be taken within two hours from and after
the time of arrest, and that a chemical test thereof be made. The analysis
disclosed by such chemical test shall be made available to such arrested person
forthwith upon demand.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.09  FEE.
   A reasonable fee shall be allowed to the person withdrawing a blood sample
or administering a urine test at the request and direction of a law-enforcement
officer in accordance with the provisions of this article. If the person whose
blood sample was withdrawn or whose urine was tested was arrested and charged
with a violation of section two of this article, the county having venue of
such charge shall pay said fee, and if said person is subsequently convicted of
such charge, such fee shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the criminal
proceeding and shall be paid, notwithstanding any other provision of this code
to the contrary, into the general fund of said county. If the person whose
blood sample was withdrawn or whose urine was tested was arrested and charged
with a violation of a similar ordinance of any municipality, said municipality
shall pay said fee, and if said person is subsequently convicted of such
charge, such fee shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the criminal
proceeding and shall be paid, notwithstanding any other provision of this code
to the contrary, into the general fund of said municipality.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)

345.35  OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.
   (a)   A person may not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under eighteen years
of age, and any passenger in the front seat of the passenger vehicle is
restrained by a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety
standards.  For the purposes of this section, "passenger vehicle" means a motor
vehicle which is designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including
the driver, except that the term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or
any motor vehicle which is not required on the date of the enactment of this
section under a federal motor vehicle safety standard to be equipped with a
belt system.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all passenger
vehicles manufactured after the first day of January, 1967, and being 1968
models and newer.
   (b)   The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not apply to
a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States Postal
Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or operator
with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would prevent
appropriate restraint in the safety belt if the condition is duly certified by
a physician who states the nature of the disability as well as the reason such
restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)   Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be fined
not more than twenty-five dollars ($25.00).  No court costs or other fees may
be assessed for a violation of this section.
   (d)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages:  provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct
an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.  Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages.  The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof.  In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five
percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the
issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt may not be
presented to the jury.  In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar
amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of
Motor Vehicles as a result of a violation of this section.

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces.  Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage.  The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle.  The photographs must show the
vehicle in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. 
Within the discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers
may issue citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the
illegally parked vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement
agency, who may issue a citation, which includes the photographs and the form,
to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be trained on
the requirements for citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or
designated accessible parking areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   The Municipality in enforcing this section shall retain all fines and

take title to such motor vehicle free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership, and shall receive a sales receipt from the Police Department.  The
sales receipt at such sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of
transferring such motor vehicle to a licensed salvage yard or to a demolisher
for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and no further titling of such motor
vehicle shall be necessary by either the purchaser at the auction, the licensed
salvage yard or the demolisher, who shall be exempt from the payment of any
fees and taxes required under West Va. Code Article 17A-3 (as so provided in
West Va. Code 17-24-9); provided, that the purchaser at the auction must place
such motor vehicle in the possession of a licensed salvage yard or demolisher
within twenty days from the date he purchased such motor vehicle and the
licensed salvage yard or demolisher must demolish, wreck or dismantle such
motor vehicle within six months after taking possession of such motor vehicle
and if such licensed salvage yard or demolisher does not, such licensed salvage
yard or demolisher shall be required to pay all fees and taxes required under

   (b)    When the Police Department has in its custody and possession old
vehicle tires or inoperative or abandoned household appliances collected in
accordance with this article, it shall sell such property from time to time at
public auction or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher.

storing said property and the expenses of conducting any auction and any notice
and publication expenses incurred pursuant to this article.
   (b)   Any remainder from the proceeds of such sale shall be deposited in the
City treasury to be kept and maintained as a special revolving account,
designated as the "abandoned and junked property fund;" provided, that any
remainder from the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle or junked
motor vehicle after payment of such expenses shall be held for the last
registered owner of such motor vehicle or any lienholder for ninety days, after
which time, if no owner or lienholder claims the remainder, it shall be
deposited in said special fund.
   (c)   Any money so collected and deposited in such special fund shall be
used solely for the payment of auction, towing, removing, preserving, storing,
notice and publication costs which result from taking other abandoned motor
vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and inoperative or abandoned
household appliances into custody and possession; provided, that whenever the
abandoned and junked vehicle fund exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars the
City Council may, by resolution, transfer such excess to the general fund.
365.08  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; ADDITIONAL REMEDY.
   In addition to all other remedies provided for in this article, the City
Attorney, of his own volition or at the instance of any citizen, resident or

   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not

      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment.  The fact that a mercantile establishment

article for the privilege of engaging in business of contracting within the
City of Lewisburg, such payment of such tax to be based upon the amount of the
building permit issued by the City of Lewisburg for the work to be performed by
such person, as a condition precedent to the issuance of such building permit.
In lieu of such prior payment in cash of such tax any such nonresident may
guarantee the payment of such privilege tax provided for herein by delivering

737.34  INTEREST AND PENALTY.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this article, if not paid when due, shall bear

of five (5.00 %) percent of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof,
of delinquency, and one (1.00%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or
fraction thereof of delinquency provided, that if such failure is due to
reasonable cause, the Treasurer may waive, in whole or in part, these
penalties. Additionally, if the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to
evade any such tax there shall be added an additional penalty of twenty-five
(25.00%) of the tax owed, exclusive of penalties.
   (c)   Interest and penalties may be collected in the same manner as the tax
imposed by this article. (Ord. 172.  Passed 3-21-06.)

face or as applied, the remaining provisions of this article shall remain in
full force and effect; and to this end, the provisions of this article are
declared to be severable.
(Ord. 172.  Passed 3-21-06.)

supercede and replace the ordinance passed and adopted January 21, 1992

   (f)   Requirements.
      (1)   Water Purveyor.
         A.   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform inspection
and testing.
         B.   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises and inform the owner by letter of any correction action deemed
necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the
correction to be made. Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed. However,
this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved
and the history of the device(s) in question.
         C.   The Water Purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow prevention, which will be
regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
         D.   The Water Purveyor shall inform the Owner by letter, of any
failure to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The Purveyor will
allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event the
Owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second
re-inspection, the Water Purveyor will inform the Owner by letter, that the
water service to the Owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to
exceed five (5) days. In the event the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of

extension may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an
additional thirty (30) days.
   E.   If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat to
the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
         F.   The Purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to determine
the nature of existing or potential hazards. An initial focus will be on high
hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (2)   Owner.
         A.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all cross-connections on his premises.
         B.   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
         C.   The Owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow
preventer, which is revealed by periodic testing.
         D.   The Owner shall inform the Purveyor of any proposed or modified
cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the Owner is
aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
         E.   The Owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow
preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.
Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
         F.   The Owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
         G.   The Owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Water Purveyor or WVBPH.
         H.   Any Owner having a private well or other private water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system.
         I.   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor’s side of the backflow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
         J.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspection for non-compliance
with the Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
   (g)   Degree of Hazard.  The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the
public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be
classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved
backflow prevention devices.
   (h)   Existing In-Use Backflow Prevention Devices.  Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the Water Purveyor to continue in service unless
the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present
backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential
installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced
pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow
device is present.
   (i)   Periodic Testing.
      (1)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester.
This testing will be done at the owner's expense.
      (3)   Any backflow preventer, which fails during a periodic test, will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test
date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the owner insuring that there is uninterrupted water service
during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner
desires such continuity.
      (4)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (i)(1) hereof, in cases where there is a history of
test failures and the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
borne by the owner.
   (j)   Records.  The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections.
Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH upon request, the Water
Purveyor will submit records of inspection, surveys, tests or corrective
actions to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

1121.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted a Vacant Structure Code for the City of Lewisburg.
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.02  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the City, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (c)   This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and /or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (d)   The City, by and through its departments (particularly the Building
Maintenance Board) shall inspect and monitor vacant buildings (especially
vacant downtown buildings), shall assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby structures, and shall promote substantial efforts to
rehabilitate and develop such buildings when appropriate.
   (e)   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing
procedure (that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders,
fines, liens, appeals and due process lien enforcement) by placing the
responsibility to register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner
before a building's condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a
complaint.
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.03  DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
   (1)   “Boarded” means a building or structure subject to the provision of
this article shall be deemed to be "boarded" if in place of one or more
exterior doors, other than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a
sheet or sheets of plywood or similar material covering the space for such door
or window.
   (2)   “Exterior maintenance and major systems" means the safe and lawful
maintenance of the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior
of the building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the
roof, the electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer
system, and the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of  the lot, as applicable and
as enforced by the Building Maintenance Board, particularly in connection with
codes adopted by the City as well as all applicable local, state and federal
laws.
   (3)   “Occupied”.  Any building or structure shall be deemed to be occupied
if one or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides in all or
any part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the legal or
equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient basis,
or any combination of the same.  For purposes of this article, evidence offered
to prove that a building is so occupied may include, but shall not be limited
to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S. Postal
Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and sewer
services; a valid City business license, or the most recent, federal, state or
City income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the official
business or residence address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or 
proof of bonafide pre-rental inspection.
   (4)   “Open”.  A building or structure subject to the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be "open" if any one or more exterior doors other
than a storm door is broken, open and /or closed but, without a properly
functioning lock to secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not
capable of being locked and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the
same.
   (5)   “Owner”.  An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents,
receiver, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or
corporation that is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to
the provisions of this article, and as set forth below.
   (6)   “Vacant”.  A building or structure shall be deemed to be vacant if no
person or persons actually, currently conduct a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully reside, dwell, or live in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on
a permanent, non-transient basis.  A building or structure shall be deemed
vacant and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided
herein if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources, water service, etc).  Continued is meant to be
without more than one thirty (30) day interruption in any given three hundred
sixty (360) day period.  In order for such continual utility service to be
considered as being actually in use as described in this article, it must be
more than merely registered to the owner for purposes of billing and must be
utilized, at a minimum, in order to keep the property and the major systems of
the building in compliance with building and safety codes.  The person or
entity asserting that there has been continued utility service has the burden
to produce actual bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
      (Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.04  STANDARDS.
   All vacant structures shall also comply with the following criteria:

gardens maintained at no more than 12 inches of growth.  All noxious weeds are
prohibited.
   (b)   Structure is to be broom swept and cleared of all contents, not
including building materials or components to be used in the future renovation
at that structure.
   (c)   Electrical service is to provided to the building via temporary pole
service on the exterior of the structure or create a permanent service for the
structure and install two GFCI protected receptacles.
   (d)   NEC and OSHA compliant string lighting is to be provided to the entire
structure so that it may be illuminated as needed to view the structure.
   (e)   Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be
removed.  Unstable or unsound accessory buildings are to be razed or renovated.
   (f)   Using wood sheet goods, all loose, deteriorated and broken windows and
doors are to be covered to eliminate the danger of their falling and to prevent
the unwanted entry of trespassers.  Such wood sheet goods are to be cut and
neatly fit, not just nailed over the opening. 
   (g)   All loose or deteriorated trim, gutter or overhang extensions (masonry
or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
   (h)   Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the owner
to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above items.
   (i)   Utilities need to be connected to the structure.

Each such owner shall cause to be filed a notarized registration statement,

any other information deemed necessary by the Building Maintenance Board.  The
registration fee(s) as required by this section shall be billed by the City and
shall be paid by the last day of the month when the property has been
registered.  For purposes of this section, the following shall also be
applicable:

      (Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.06  INSPECTIONS.
   At the time of registration, the Chief Building Inspector, Fire Chief, City
Engineer and Police Chief shall determine whether it is necessary for any or
all of them to inspect the structure so as to identify any public safety issues
needing addressed.  Inspections shall also be available to verify the status of
any property concerning occupancy, vacancy, etc.  If an internal inspection is
deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same and arrangements made
for the same.  If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and arrange for an
inspection, the City will seek an administrative search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, which shall include the Municipal Court, to authorize
inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining the structural
integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to insure its structural
integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and police
officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do not
present a hazard to the public during the time that the building remains
vacant. 
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.07  CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   The property owners shall be notified in writing of any corrective action
deemed necessary for the protection of life and safety and enforcement of the
City Building Code.  This notice shall contain the applicable code provisions
and regulations in question, as well as setting a reasonable time for the
correction to be taken.
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.08  REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   (a)   At the time of adoption of this article, all owners of realty within
the City of Lewisburg that contain a vacant structure, as defined above, shall
register the same with the Office of the Building Inspector of the City. For
those structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption of
this article, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure
with the Building Inspector within 30 days after the structure is found to meet
the definition of a vacant structure.  The registration form shall require
information from the registrant deemed necessary by the Administrator, Building
Inspector, Fire Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief of the City, so as to
ensure that the purpose of this article is met.  Specifically, the above named
City officers shall have the authority to require that the property owner
provide a professional opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to determine the
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time the building remains
vacant.  The above named officers shall have the authority to issue orders to
the owner for corrective action deemed necessary.  The Building Inspector and
Fire Chief shall rely upon the West Virginia State Building Code and Fire Code,
as well as other applicable law, for guidance during any such structural
review.
   (b)   If none of the persons listed, as above, is shown at an address within
the State, the registration statement also shall provide the name and address
of a person who resides within the state and who is authorized to accept
service of process on behalf of the owners and who shall be designated as a
responsible, local party or agent, both for purposes of notification in the
event of an emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare and for
purposes of service of any and all notices or registration statements as herein
authorized and in connection herewith.  Registration shall be required for all
vacant buildings, whether vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant and
boarded, and shall be required whenever any building has remained vacant for
sixty consecutive days or more.  In no instance shall the registration of a
vacant building and the payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate
the owner, agent or responsible party for compliance with any other Building
Code or Fire Code requirement.  One registration statement may be filed to
include all vacant buildings of the owner so registering, but each structure
constitutes a separate fee.  The owner of the vacant property as of the last
day of the month when the property has been registered of each calendar year
shall be responsible for the payment of the non-refundable registration fee. 
Said fee shall be billed by the City; and based on the duration of the vacancy
as determined by the following scale:
      (1)   No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one year;
      (2)   $200.00 for properties that are vacant for at least one year but
less than two years;
      (3)   $ 400.00 for properties that are vacant for at least two years but
less than three years;
      (4)   $600.00 for properties that are vacant for at least three years but
less than four years;
      (5)   $ 800.00  for properties that are vacant for at least four years
but less than five years; and
      (6)   $1,600 for properties that are vacant for at least five years, plus
an additional $ 300 for each year in excess of five years.
         (Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.09  RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)   The owner shall have the right to appeal the imposition of the
registration fees to the City Administrator; upon filing an application in
writing to the Building Inspector no later than 15 calendar days after the date
of the billing statement.  On appeal, the owner shall bear the burden of
providing satisfactory objective proof of occupancy as defined in this article
specifically.
   (b)   A waiver of the registration fee, or an extension of a waiver fee up
to 90 days from the date of the current billing statement, may be granted by
the City Administrator or his designee upon application of the owner and upon
review and advice of the Building Maintenance Board; if the owner:
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the City Administrator or
his designee that he/she is in the process of demolition, rehabilitation or
other substantial repair of the vacant building; and
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the City Administrator or his designee
a  reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition, rehabilitation, or
other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Administrator or his
designee that he/she was actively attempting to sell or lease the property
during the vacancy period; or
      (4)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Administrator, to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due
to illness of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable
explanation believed to be short term in nature and documentable as  necessary.
   (c)   Within thirty days, or as soon thereafter as possible, after the
waiver application  is received, the City Administrator or his designee shall
grant or deny the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and dispatch
the written decision by mail to the owner.  If the owner properly submitted an
application for a waiver or request for extension to the City Administrator or
his designee, and the City Administrator or his designee rendered a decision
which the owner seeks to appeal to the City Council, the owner must file an
Appeal Petition in writing no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the
City Administrator or his designee's decision.  City Council shall either grant
or deny the appeal.  Thereafter the decision of the City Council is final
unless within thirty (30) days of such decision the owner appeals for
injunctive relief to the Circuit Court of Greenbrier County.
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.10  AMENDING INFORMATION.
   (a)   Duty to Amend Registration Statement.  If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same, to
contact the Building Inspector within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of
such change and advise the Building Inspector in writing of those changes.
   (b)   Exceptions.   This section shall not apply to any building owned by
the United States, the State of West Virginia, the City of Lewisburg, or any of
their respective agencies or political subdivisions.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties for Failure to Register.  The failure or
refusal for any reason, of any owner, or agent of an owner acting on behalf of
the owner, to register a vacant building upon adoption of this article or to
pay any fees required to be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section,
within 30 days after they become due, shall constitute a violation punishable
upon conviction thereof by a fine in the amount of not less than $100.00 nor
more than $500.00 for each failure or refusal to pay a required vacant building
fee, as applicable.  In such cases, whenever the minimum fine of $100.00 is
imposed, it shall not be subject to suspension or reduction for any reason.
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.11  REINSPECTION.
   All vacant structures are subject to reinspection on an annual basis or as

1121.06.
(Ord. 218.  Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.12  NON-PAYMENT OF FEES/LIENS.
   (a)   After the owner is given notice of the amount of the registration fee
due, except for those owners that have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to
Section
1121.09, and the owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall
constitute a debt due and owing to the City and the City may commence a civil
action to collect such unpaid debt.
   (b)   If an owner fails to pay the registration fee as assessed and the City
begins the collection action to enforce its lien, then the Zoning Officer shall
post the written notice on the property and send the written notice to the
owner(s) by certified and regular mail.
   (c)   The City may take action to sell the subject property by means of
forfeiture and the Court ordered enforcement process to collect the debt owed
the City.  Should the City take the steps necessary to sell the subject
property, the City shall do so, subject to all liens and real and personal
property taxes that are due.  Purchasers of the subject property shall be
similarly responsible for registration pursuant to this section in the same
manner as the prior owner and must begin the registration process anew if said
property remains vacant.

1141.07  APPEAL.
   (a)   Issuance of a citation under the provisions of this section shall be

citation.  As such, any person who is issued a citation shall pay the fine
indicated for the violation, as set forth in Section
1141.05, in full to the office of the municipal court clerk within ten days of
the service of the citation.  Any person alleging that he or he was improperly
issued such citation may, within ten days of service of such citation, file a
petition for appeal of the citation or payment thereof, along with the required
bond, with the municipal court clerk in accordance with the following:
      (1)   In order to properly and timely appeal his or her citation, within
ten days of service of the citation, the alleged violator shall pay the
required amount of the applicable fine in full to the municipal court clerk,
which amount will be held by the municipal court as bond pending evidentiary
hearing before, and resolution of the case by, the municipal court; the
municipal court clerk shall issue a receipt to the alleged violator showing the
amount of the bond paid.  In addition to the bond, the alleged violator shall
file with the municipal court clerk a petition for appeal of the citation.  If
any petition for appeal filed in accordance with this section is not timely
filed or is not accompanied with the required bond, the alleged violator shall
be deemed to have waived his or her right to appeal the citation, and such
petition shall be summarily denied as untimely filed; provided, however that
nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the municipal judge from finding,
upon proper application and showing, that an alleged violator suffers from a
financial hardship, and, as a result, waiving the requirement that the bond be
posted as a prerequisite to filing a petition for appeal.
      (2)   Any petition for appeal filed with the municipal court clerk must
be in writing, on the form to be provided by the municipal court clerk, and
must be signed by the alleged violator affirming that the contents of the
petition are true and accurate to the best of the alleged violator's knowledge
at that time.  Such petition for appeal shall state the facts and reasons in
support of the petition.  Upon filing any such petition for appeal with the
municipal court clerk, the alleged violator shall serve a copy of the petition
and the receipt showing proof of bond or waiver upon the city attorney.
   (b)   Upon the filing of any petition for appeal with the municipal court
clerk, the clerk or his or her designee shall place the case on the municipal
court docket, set the case for evidentiary hearing within 30 days from the date
of the filing of the petition for appeal, provide a notice of hearing to the
alleged violator, and forward a copy of the petition to the enforcement
officer.  Upon receipt of the petition, the enforcement office shall cause a
copy of the citation at issue to be forwarded to the municipal court clerk who
shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation indicated
therein.
   (c)   The municipal court shall treat the citation itself as the original
complaint before the court, and shall treat it as prima facie evidence of the
violation alleged therein.  At the  close of all of the evidence presented at
the hearing on the petition for appeal, should the municipal court judge find
against the alleged violator, the bond posted by the alleged violator shall be
applied as payment for the fine imposed for the violation.  In the event the
municipal court judge finds that a violator suffers from financial hardship,
the municipal court judge may permit alternative sentencing.  Should the court
find in favor of the alleged violator, the bond shall be refunded to the
alleged violator by the municipal court clerk, and the citation shall be
dismissed.

1309.01  URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES.
   The design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the land
use, community facilities, transportation, utility and related principles
contained in these regulations as follows:
   (a)   The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential and other
developed land uses should be designed to provide adequate light, air, open
space, landscaping with living plants and  off street parking.
   (b)   The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of existing topography, natural
views and scenic vistas and natural physical features.  Tree masses and large
individual trees should be preserved.  The system of roadways, sidewalks and
bikeways should be designed to take advantage of the areas visual qualities.
   (c)   Circulation in subdivisions within Lewisburg should be provided in
accordance with the following design principles.

required by the Lewisburg Zoning Code, except where they may be approved as
part of a Planned Development subdivision.

major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or
orientation.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.03  EASEMENTS.
   (a)   The subdivider shall dedicate to the public appropriate easements to
the end that each and every lot, piece, or parcel of land within subdivision
shall have access to all available essential public facilities.

   (c)    Reserve strips as defined in these regulations shall be prohibited.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.04  DESIGN STANDARDS; PLANNED DEVELOPMENT SUBDIVISIONS.
   Whenever a subdivision is developed under the Planned Development Overlay
Zoning District classification, the Planning Commission may vary the
requirements of these regulations in accordance with the Lewisburg Zoning Code
in order to allow the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of streets,
lots, and building lines, but at the same time protect the convenience, health,
safety and welfare of future residents, as well as the character of the
surrounding property and general welfare of the community.  In no case,
however, shall the proposed design violate other requirements of the Lewisburg
Zoning Ordinance or be construed in such a manner as to circumvent the
requirements for adequate streets, easements, sidewalks and other essential
public improvements. 
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.05  PUBLIC AREAS AND OPEN SPACE.
   Parks shall be provided in accordance with the requirements and standards

subdivisions within the RR Rural Residential zones, shall have installed in
them sidewalks to serve each lot and parcel of land situated within the
subdivision.
   (b)    No plat shall receive the approval of either the Planning Commission
or City Council unless provisions for the installation of sidewalks are part of
said plat.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.07  SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS: STREETS.
   It is the intent of this section that all lots and blocks provided in a
subdivision abut on a street adequate to accommodate all traffic generated in a
reasonable and safe manner. The arrangement, character, grade, width and
location of all streets shall be designed in accordance with the following
provisions.
   (a)   Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all major and
collector streets.
   (b)   Residential lots shall not front onto a major street but only abut on
rear and side lot lines, unless a road is provided for access purposes or when

   (c)   Subdivision streets shall not open onto major streets except at an
average interval of not less than one quarter mile, measured from the

must be maintained, where possible by more than one access point.
   (e)   Collector streets shall be provided in the subdivision wherever
traffic is being collected from minor streets to provide access to a major
street or community facility.  Any street shall be deemed a collector street
when it serves more than fifty dwelling units.
   (f)   A tentative plan of the proposed future street system shall be shown
on the preliminary plat.
   (g)   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
extension of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for
adequate utility easements and connections for such resubdivision.
   (h)   A street crossing another street should continue on the same
alignment: however, if it does not, then the offset should be not less than 125
feet measured from the centerlines.
   (i)   Street right of way widths, pavement and sidewalk construction
specifications and construction standards shall be in accordance with
requirements of the City of Lewisburg Department of Public Works.
   (j)   Half streets shall be prohibited.
   (k)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
existing streets.  Street names and house numbers shall be subject to approval
of the Department of Public Works.

   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size, or shape or it

application of the requirements contained in this article would result in
substantial hardship or inequity, the Planning Commission with the approval of
the City Council may modify or vary requirements of design, but not procedure
or offsite improvements, so that the subdivider may develop the property in a
reasonable manner, provided that the public welfare and interests of the City
are protected and the purpose and intent of these regulations are preserved. 
Provided, however, that a variation based upon unique conditions shall not be
granted when the unique condition(s) was created or contributed to by the
subdivider.  (Passed 2-15-94.)
1321.02  PARTIAL EXCEPTION FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   Whenever a tract of land under a single ownership which is to be subdivided
into three or fewer lots, where all required off site improvements are in place
and accepted by the City, the proposed subdivision may be exempted from the
procedural requirements of this article, but this shall not constitute an
exemption from any of the design or off site improvements requirements
contained herein.  Exemptions may be permitted for minor subdivisions under the

1351.14  EXCAVATIONS.
   (a)   Generally. The Council finds that surface excavation, unregulated,
causes soil erosion, materials landslides, noxious materials, stream pollution,
accumulation of stagnant water, increase in the chance of floods and slides,
destroys the value of some lands, destroys aesthetic values, counteracts
efforts for the conservation of water, soils and other natural resources, and
destroys or impairs the health, safety, welfare and property rights of the
citizens of the City, where proper surface excavation and reclamation is not
practiced.
   (b)   Permits Required.  It shall be hereinafter unlawful for any person,
partnership, firm, association, trust or corporation to excavate, remove or
disturb the overburden of any property located within the City, if the
overburden removed equals or exceeds 1,200 cubic yards of surface and sub soil,
or one (1) acre of surface area, excluding any excavation required as a result
of construction authorized by the issuance of a City building permit.
   No excavation or surface removal, as aforesaid, shall be removed without a
permit issued by the City, and then only in accordance with the regulations and
specifications of the City. Applications for a surface excavation permit shall
be made in writing on forms prescribed by the Council and shall be signed and
verified by the applicant.
   The application, in addition to other such information as may be reasonably
required by the Council, shall contain the following information:
      (1)    A reasonable estimate of the amount of soil to be removed and
excavated and the number of acres of land that will be disturbed,
      (2)    The owner or owners of the land to be excavated,
      (3)    The source of the operator's legal right to enter and conduct
operations on the land to be covered by the permit,
      (4)    The names and post office addresses of every officer, partner,
director, and applicant must accompany such application,
      (5)    The names and addresses of the owners of all lands within 500 feet
of any part of the proposed disturbed land, which such owners shall be notified
by registered or certified mail of such application and such owners shall be
given ten (10) days within which to file written objections thereto, if any,
with the Council.
   (c)    Application for Permits. Any person, partnership, firm, association,
trust or corporation shall file the permit application with the Mayor or a
designated representative. Upon filing an application in proper form,
accompanied by the fees and bond required by this Ordinance and after
consideration of the merits of the application and written protests, if any, 
the Council may issue the permit applied for if the applicant has complied with
all the provisions of this Ordinance.
   The permit shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. Upon
verified application, containing such information as the Council may reasonably
require, accompanied by such fees and bonds as required by this ordinance, the
Council may, from year to year renew the permit, if the operation is in
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance.
   The registration fee for all permits for surface excavation shall be fifty
dollars ($50.00)  per 1,000 cubic yards of overburden to be removed, or per one
acre of surface area to be disturbed.  The annual renewal fee for permits for
surface excavation shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00)  per 1,000 cubic
yards of overburden to be removed, or per one acre of surface area to be
disturbed, payable on the anniversary date of said permit.
   The permit of any operator who fails to pay any fee provided for in this
Ordinance shall be revoked.
   (d)    Bond Required.  No surface excavation permit under this Ordinance
shall be granted until the applicant, or someone acting on behalf of the
applicant, has made a cash deposit or given a corporate  surety bond to the
City in such amount as may be deemed by the Council sufficient to cover the
cost of safeguards, disposal of excavated dirt, etc., and restoration of the
surface of the area of excavation  in compliance with state surface mining
regulations.
   Each such bond shall be payable to the City, shall have corporate surety,
shall be approved by the City Attorney, and shall be conditioned that the work
be diligently and skillfully performed, that all necessary safeguards be
maintained, that all excavated materials not required for refill be disposed of
and that the surface of the place of excavation and not less than seventy-five
feet in all directions from the outer perimeter thereof be placed in as good
condition as it was immediately prior to the commencement of work and to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Council or their agent.
   (e)    Time in Which Reclamation Shall be Done. It shall be the duty of the
operator to commence the reclamation of the area of land disturbed by the
operation after the completion of surface excavation of that area in accordance
with plans previously approved by the Council and to complete such reclamation
within three (3) months after the permit has expired, except that such grading,
backfilling and water management practices as are approved in    the plans
shall be kept current with the operations as defined by rules and regulations
of  the Council, and no permit or supplement to a permit shall be issued or
renewed, if in the discretion of the Council, these practices are not current
   (f)   Cessation of Operations by Inspector.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Ordinance, a Council designated inspector shall have the
authority to order the immediate cessation of any operation where:
      (1)    Any of the requirements of this Ordinance or the rules and
regulations promulgated pursuant thereto or orders of the Council have not been
complied with, or
      (2)    The public safety or welfare call for the immediate cessation of
the operation. 
   Such cessation of operation shall continue until corrective steps have been
started by the operator to the satisfaction of the Inspector.  Any operator who
believes they have been aggrieved by the actions of the Inspector may
immediately appeal to the Council setting forth reasons why the operation
should not be halted. The Council shall determine immediately when and if the
operation may continue.
   (g)    Noncompliance. If any of the requirements of this Ordinance or rules
and regulations promulgated thereto or the orders of the Council have not been
complied with within the time limits set by the Council or by this Ordinance,
the Council shall cause a notice of noncompliance to be served upon the
operator, which notice shall order the operations to cease, or where found
necessary, the Council shall order the suspension of a permit.  A copy of such
notice or order shall be handed to the operator in person, or served by
certified mail addressed to the operator at their permanent address shown on
the application for a permit.
   The notice of noncompliance or order of suspension shall specify in what
respects the operator failed to comply with this Ordinance or the rules and
regulations of the Council or the orders of the Council. If the operator has
not reached an agreement with the Council or has not complied with the
requirements set forth in the notice of noncompliance or order of suspension
within the time limits set therein, the permit may be revoked by order of the
Council and the performance bond shall then be forfeited. If an agreement
satisfactory to the Council has not been reached within thirty (30) days after
suspension of any permit, any and all suspended permits shall then be declared
revoked and the performance bonds with respect thereto forfeited.
   When any bond is forfeited pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance, the
Council shall give notice to the City Attorney, who shall collect the
forfeiture without delay.

1351.15  BLASTING.
   (a)   When blasting of overburden or mineral is necessary within the City of
Lewisburg, such blasting shall be done in accordance with established
principles for preventing vibration damage to residences, buildings and other
property located in the City of Lewisburg.
   (b)   Such blasting shall be considered in compliance with the provisions of
this Ordinance if the following measures are followed:
      (1)   The weight in pounds of explosive charge detonated at any one time
shall conform with the following scaled distance formula: W = (D/50)
(squared).  Where W = weight in pounds of explosive detonated at any one
instant time, the D = distance in feet from  the nearest point of blast to
nearest residence, building or structure: that explosive charges shall be
considered to be detonated at one time if their detonation occurs within eight 
milliseconds of each other.
      (2)   Where blast size would exceed under subsection (b)(1) hereof, blast
shall be detonated by the use of delay detonators (either electric or not
electric) to provide detonation times separated by nine milliseconds or more
for each of the blasts complying with the scaled distance of the formula.
      (3)   A plan of each blasting operation's methods for compliance with
this section (blast delay design) for typical blast which shall be adhered to
in all blasting within the City of Lewisburg, shall be submitted to the City of
Lewisburg with the application for a permit.  It shall be accepted if it meets
the scaled distance formula established in subsection (b)(1) hereof.
      (4)   Records of each blast shall be kept in a log to be maintained for
at least three (3) years, which will show for each blast other than secondary 
(boulder breaking) blasts the following information:
         A.   Date and time of blast,
         B.   Number of holes,
         C.   Typical explosive weight per delay,
         D.   Total explosives and blast at any one time,
         E.   Number of delays used,
         F.   Weather conditions, and
         G.   Signature of operator/employee in charge of the blast.
      (5)   Where inspection by the City of Lewisburg establishes that the
scaled distance formula and the approved preplan are not being adhered to, the
following penalty shall be imposed:
         A.   For the first offense in any one permit year under this
Ordinance, the permit holder shall be assessed a fine of not less than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For the second offense in any one permit year under this
Ordinance, the permit holder shall be assessed a fine of not less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000);
         C.   For the third offense in any one permit year under this Ordinance
or for the failure to pay any assessment hereinabove set forth within a
reasonable time established by the Mayor of the City of Lewisburg, the permit
shall be revoked.
   All such assessments as set forth in this Ordinance shall be determined by
the City Council for the City of Lewisburg, and shall be collected by the Mayor
of the City of Lewisburg or his designated agent.
         D.   Each operator who shall make application for a permit under this
Ordinance, at the time such permit is requested, furnish bond on a form to be
prescribed and furnished by the City of Lewisburg, payable to City of Lewisburg
and conditioned that the operator shall faithfully perform all the requirements
of this Ordinance.  The amount of the bond shall be determined at the
discretion of the Mayor.  The minimum amount of bond furnished shall be one
thousand dollars ($1,000).  Such bond shall be executed by the operator and a
corporate surety licensed to do business in the State of West Virginia. 
Provided, however, that in lieu of corporate surety, the operator may elect to
deposit with the Mayor cash in the amount of the bond.
         E.   Only a certified "shot firer" as determined by the Mayor shall be
permitted to handle explosives.
         F.   It shall hereafter be unlawful for any person to blast or
overburden minerals without having first obtained from the City of Lewisburg a
permit therefore.  Application for a blasting permit shall be made in writing
on forms prescribed by the City of Lewisburg and shall be signed and verified
by the applicant, containing such information as the City of Lewisburg, may
reasonably require.  The application fee shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per
1,000 cu. yds. of material moved or one acre of surface disturbed with a
minimum fee of fifty dollars ($50.00).
         G.   Blasting without a permit shall be punishable on the first
offense by a fine not exceeding one hundred ($100.00).  Second and subsequent
offenses by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or
imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days.  Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate offense.
         H.   The permit shall be valid for one (1) year from its date of
issue.
            (Passed 2-15-94.)
1351.16  CERTIFIED MAIL/RESTRICTED DELIVERY.
   Applicants shall provide "Certified Mail/Restricted Delivery with return
receipt" notice to all adjacent landowners as per current tax records, at least
seven (7) days prior to the hearing. The applicant will provide a copy of the
relevant portion of the tax map and proof of the certified mail deliveries to
the City. The determination of adjacent will be made as if public easements and
rights-of-way were nonexistent. (Thus, property across the street would be
considered adjacent. Property with a common corner is considered adjacent.)

(See Planning Commission minutes of 8-10-95 as per this Ordinance Section 59 C
the Planning Commission determined that the 40% was met for Crowfields thus new
construction only had to meet a 20' setback.)
   (b)   Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line
with a lot in a residential district, and the setbacks in the nonresidential
district are less than the setback in the residential district, the
nonresidential district lot shall be required to observe the setback applicable
to the adjoining residential lot.
   (c)   In a residential district, if more than forty percent (40%) of the

1359.01  NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   (a)    All developments in all zoning districts, except the CC, Community
Center District shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to
accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted
to the development in question. The basis for determining the required number
of parking spaces shall be the Table of Parking Requirements following Section
1359.02.
   (b)    The Council recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements as set
forth cannot cover every possible situation that may arise and therefore, in
cases not specifically covered, the permit-issuing authority is authorized to
determine the parking requirement using the Table as a guide.  (Passed 2-15-
94.)
1359.02  FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (a)    The Council recognizes that due to the particularities of any given
development, inflexible application of the parking requirement set forth in the
Table may result with either inadequate parking space or parking space far in
excess of its needs. Therefore, as suggested in Section
1359.02(b), the permit issuing authority may deviate from the requirements in
the Table of Parking requirements and may require more or allow less parking
whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standards
set forth in the Table of Parking Requirements.
   (b)    Whenever the permit issuing authority allows or requires a deviation
from the Table of Parking Requirements, the reasons for such deviation shall be
noted on the building permit.

spaces and sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back
into a public street.
   (b)    Unless no other practical alternative is available, vehicle-parking
areas shall be designed so that vehicles may exit an area without backing onto
a public street.  This requirement does not apply to one and two family
dwelling units.
   (c)    Vehicle circulation areas of all developments shall be designed so
that sanitation, emergency and public service vehicles can serve such
developments without having to make hazardous or dangerous turning movements.

protection against potholes, erosion and dust, and shall be properly maintained
in all respects including free from potholes.
   (b)    Parking and vehicle circulation areas that are not provided with the
type of surface as specified in subsection (a) shall be graded and surfaced
with crushed stone, gravel or other suitable material that is stable and

uses, but except as provided for in this section, the required space assigned
to one use may not be assigned to any other use.
   (b)    To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the
same parking spaces operate at different times, the same space may be credited
to both uses. For example, if a church parking lot is only  occupied to fifty
percent (50%) of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could
make use of fifty percent (50%) of the church lot's spaces on those other
days.  (Passed 2-15-94.)
1359.07  SATELLITE PARKING.
   (a)    If the number of off street parking spaces required by this Ordinance
cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot where the principal use
associated with the parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on
adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with provisions of this section and the
Table of Permitted Uses of this Ordinance. These off site spaces are referred
to as satellite parking spaces.
   (b)    All satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee
use) must be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal
building. Satellite parking for employee parking may be located within any
reasonable distance.

section must present satisfactory written evidence that they have the
permission of the owner or other person in charge to use such spaces. The
developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continued validity of the
permit depends on their continuing ability to provide the required number of
parking spaces.  (Passed 2-15-94.)
1359.08  LOADING AND UNLOADING AREAS.
   (a)    Whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods,
merchandise or equipment be routinely shipped or delivered to or from that
development, a sufficient off street loading and unloading area must be
provided in accordance with this section.
   (b)    The following table indicates the size and number of spaces that,
presumptively, satisfy standards set forth in this section.
   However, the permit issuing authority may require more or less loading and
unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard.
 
Gross Leasable    Number of Spaces*
Area of Building
1,000 - 19,999    1
20,000 - 79,999   2

the loading and unloading without obstructing or interfering with any public
right of way, or any parking space or parking lot aisle.
   (d)    No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to
satisfy the area requirements for off street parking, nor shall any portion of
any off street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for
loading and unloading facilities.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1359.09  PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN THE CC DISTRICT.
   It is the intent of this ordinance to ensure that each development provide
off street parking in amounts sufficient to meet the anticipated parking
demand. The Council recognizes, however, that physical limitations of
properties in the CC District may prohibit strict compliance with established
parking requirements. Therefore, required parking within the CC District shall
be determined during Site Plan Review and approved by the City Council based
upon the characteristics of the specific site and the availability of nearby
on-or- off street public parking.
